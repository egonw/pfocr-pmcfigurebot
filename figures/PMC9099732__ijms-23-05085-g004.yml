caption: '(A): Volcano plot showing the results for elucidating discerning markers
  between obese (BMI > 30) and non-obese patients, and those with recurring sleep
  problems, and those with normal sleep or only mild sleep problems. FC = 1, p-value
  < 0.05, BMI > 30/BMI < 30 and recuring/normal and mild sleep problems. FC = 1, p-value
  < 0.05 (B): Top 25 metabolic pathways that pathway enrichment analysis using SMPDB
  database suggested as having the most alterations, on the left in relation to obesity,
  and on the right in relation to sleep problems. The figure has been created using
  the MetaboAnalyst software (version 5.0, https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/home.xhtml
  []. (C): Mechanistic model illustrating how problems co-occurring with chronic pain
  may link at the metabolomic level. On the partial description of methionine metabolism
  (right), the blue arrows show the four metabolomic markers that are decreased in
  the recurring sleep problems subgroup in statistical analysis, suggesting downregulated
  methionine metabolism in this subgroup. Methionine metabolism is an important source
  of cysteine, needed for glutathione metabolism (left), and which appeared altered
  with obesity. The figure was created using Microsoft PowerPointÂ® (Redmond, WA, USA)
  on Microsoft Windows 11.'
