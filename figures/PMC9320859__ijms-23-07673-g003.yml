caption: Effect of AdoMet alone and in combination with miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a
  mimics on the levels of migration- and EMT-related proteins in CRC cells. Cells
  were transfected with 100 nM miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-449a in the presence or not
  (control) of 500 μM AdoMet for 48 h. The expression levels of MMP2, MMP9, E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, vimentin, and β-catenin, were detected by Western blot using the total
  cell lysate of HCT-116 (A) and Caco-2 (B) cells. The densitometric analysis was
  reported as the percentage of protein expression of untreated control (100%). For
  the equal loading of proteins in the lanes, β-actin was used as a standard. The
  images are representative of three immunoblotting analyses obtained from at least
  three independent experiments. The means were compared using analysis of variance
  (ANOVA) plus Bonferroni’s t-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus untreated cells
  (Control). Uncropped images of Western blots are reported in .
