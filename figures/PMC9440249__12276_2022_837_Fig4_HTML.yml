figure_title: MiR-375 overexpression promotes proliferation, invasion, and migration
  and inhibits apoptosis via the PTPN4-STAT3 pathway
caption: 'a qRT-PCR was performed to measure the mRNA expression of PTPN4 post PTPN4
  and/or miR-375 overexpression. b CCK-8 and c EdU incorporation assays were conducted
  to test the proliferation of DU145 and PC-3 cells in response to overexpression
  of miR-375 and/or PTPN4. d Transwell and e wound-healing assays were performed to
  determine the migration and invasion of DU145 and PC-3 cells in response to overexpression
  of miR-375 and/or PTPN4. f Apoptosis analysis of DU145 and PC-3 cells in response
  to miR-375 and/or PTPN4 overexpression. g Western blotting was conducted to evaluate
  p-STAT3, PTPN4, EMT- and apoptosis-related markers of DU145 and PC-3 cells in response
  to overexpression of miR-375 and/or PTPN4. h GSEA using the data deposited in the
  TCGA database suggested that PTPN4 negatively regulated the JAK-STAT pathway. NC:
  cells stably transfected with pSUPER-RETRO-Puro-empty vector and transiently transfected
  with pcDNA3.1-empty vector. PTPN4: cells stably transfected with pSUPER-RETRO-Puro-empty
  vector and transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-PTPN4 recombinant vector. MiR-375:
  cells stably transfected with pSUPER-RETRO-Puro-miR-375 recombinant vector and transiently
  transfected with pcDNA3.1-empty vector. MiR-375 + PTPN4: cells stably transfected
  with pSUPER-RETRO-Puro-miR-375 recombinant vector and transiently transfected with
  pcDNA3.1-PTPN4 vector.'
