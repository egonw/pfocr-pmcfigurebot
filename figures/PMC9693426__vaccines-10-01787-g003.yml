caption: Proteomic analysis. (A) PCA analysis. The abscissa PC1 and the ordinate PC2
  represent the scores of the principal components ranking, respectively, and the
  scatter color represents the experimental grouping of samples. (B) Repeatability
  CV analysis. The figure shows the cumulative CV values of all proteins in the corresponding
  samples, which indicated the repeatability of the sample. (C) Differential protein
  volcano map. The abscissa represents the difference multiple (log2 value) of the
  differential protein, the vertical axis represents p-value (−log10 value), black
  represents the protein with no-significant difference, red represents the up-regulated
  and green represents the down-regulated. (D) Differential protein-clustering heat
  map. The vertical is the clustering of samples, and the horizontal is the clustering
  of proteins. The expression-pattern clustering of protein content among samples
  can be seen from the vertical clustering. (E) Go enrichment histogram shows the
  enrichment results in three categories, each of which shows up to 20 (p value ≤
  0.05). (F) KEGG-enrichment bubble diagram. The abscissa in the diagram is the ratio
  of the number of differential proteins in the corresponding pathway to the number
  of total proteins identified in the pathway. The size of the dot represents the
  number of differential proteins in the corresponding pathway. The color of the point
  represents the p-value value of the hypergeometric test. (G) Subcellular localization
  analysis of differential proteins.
