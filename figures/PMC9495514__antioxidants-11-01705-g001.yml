caption: 'ICS II improved glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and pancreatic islet
  architecture in db/db mice. ICS II at doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg·kg−1 was administered
  to db/db mice or WT mice (starting from 8 weeks old) for 7 weeks. (a) 12 h fasting
  blood glucose of the mice (n = 8). (b) GHb level (n = 8). OGTT (c,d) and IPITT (e,f)
  were performed after 6 weeks of ICS II administration and the AUCs were calculated
  (n = 8). (g) H&E staining and insulin immunostaining (×400, scale bar = 50 μm).
  Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01 versus WT group; #p < 0.05 and ##p
  < 0.01 versus db/db group.'
