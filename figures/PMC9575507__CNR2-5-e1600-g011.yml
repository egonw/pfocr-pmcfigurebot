caption: Effect of Chloroxylon swietenia leaves methanol extract (CSLME) treatment
  on the actin cytoskeleton disruption in MCF‐7 cells. MCF‐7 cells were incubated
  with either DMSO (vehicle control) or CSLME (20 μg/ml). After treatment, the actin
  filaments were then stained with phalloidin‐FITC, while the nuclei were stained
  with DAPI. The DAPI and FITC stained images were captured using a fluorescence microscope
  and a merged profile was generated. Scale bar, 20 μm; magnification 400×

  by down‐regulating the NF‐κB pathway in MCF‐7 breast cancer cells: In vitro and
  in vivo investigations.'
