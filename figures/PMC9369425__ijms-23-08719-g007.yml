caption: Effect of luteolin treatment on BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway activation in
  the cortex of Cdkl5 +/− mice. (A) Western blot analysis of P-TrkB levels in somatosensory
  cortex homogenates from vehicle-treated Cdkl5 +/+ (n = 4) and Cdkl5 +/− (n = 4)
  mice, 7-day luteolin treated Cdkl5 +/− (Lut 7d, n = 4) and 20-day luteolin treated
  Cdkl5 +/− (Lut 20d, n = 4) mice. The histogram on the left shows P-TrkB protein
  levels normalized to corresponding total TrkB protein levels. Examples of immunoblot
  for P-TrkB on the right. (B) Histogram on the left shows protein levels of phosphorylated
  Erk1/2 normalized to the respective total form in cortex homogenates from mice treated
  as in (A). Examples of immunoblot for P-Erk1/2 on the right. (C) Histogram on the
  left shows protein levels of phosphorylated Akt normalized to the respective total
  form in cortex homogenates from mice treated as in (A). Examples of immunoblot for
  P-Akt on the right. Data are expressed as a percentage of vehicle-treated Cdkl5
  +/+ mice. Values represent mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Fisher’s
  LSD test after two-way ANOVA.
