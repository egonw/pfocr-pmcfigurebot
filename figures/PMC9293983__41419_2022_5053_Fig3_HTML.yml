figure_title: The inhibition of metastasis by CYB5A is related to its ability to increase
  autophagy
caption: 'A The different expression genes under normoxia between HCCLM3-control and
  HCCLM3-CYB5A cell lines. The significant thresholds were |fold change | > 2 and
  p < 0.05. Significant different expression genes were filtered and enriched in GO
  TRRUST analysis and KEGG signaling pathway. B, C After the cells were fixed by paraformaldehyde,
  LC3 expression was detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and immunocytochemistry (ICC).
  D Cell lines treated with or without 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) for 4 h. Cell
  lysates were analyzed by western blotting. E Images represented the typical transmission
  electron microscopy of indicated cell lines in the top panel and statistical analysis
  of autophagolysosome (ASS) numbers are in the bottom panel. The red arrows indicate
  ASS. F Images represented the typically indicated cell lines that stably expressed
  mRFP-EGFP-LC3 fusion protein which was shown by confocal microscopic analysis in
  the top panel and statistical analysis of autophagosome and ASS numbers in the bottom
  panel. Scale bar: 20 μm.'
