caption: HTR2A agonist DOI increases the melanogenesis in cultured human skin tissue
  and zebrafish embryos. (a). The morphological photos, H&E staining and Masson-Fonta
  staining of human skin tissue treated with HTR2A agonist DOI (0.05, 0.1, and 0.3
  mM). Scale bar, 100 mm (morphology of skin tissue), 50 μm (H&E staining and Masson-Fonta
  staining). (b). Relative melanin content in human skin tissue treated with DOI (0.05,
  0.1, and 0.3 mM) as compared with the control (n = 3). (c). Western blot shows the
  protein expression of MITF and TYR in human skin tissue treated with DOI (0.05,
  0.1, and 0.3 mM). (d). The morphology of melanocytes in zebrafish embryos at 60
  hpf treated with DOI (1, 10, 50, and 100 μM) from 35–60 hpf. The left column shows
  the whole view of zebrafish embryos (lateral view). The right three columns show
  the amplification photos of head (lateral view), trunk (lateral view) and head (dorsal
  view). Scale bar, 100 μm.* (p < 0.05) compared to control group.
