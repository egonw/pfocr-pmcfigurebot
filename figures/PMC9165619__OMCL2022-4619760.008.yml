caption: 'CBD plays protective effects on OM via the Nrf2/Keap1/ARE pathway. HOK cells
  were transfected with Nrf2-siRNA and Scramble-siRNA, respectively. After 6 hrs transfection,
  HOK cells were treated with 5-FU and CBD. Then, the cells were collected for the
  following analysis. (a) Knockdown efficiency of Nrf2 as measured by qRT-PCR. ∗P
  < 0.05vs. vehicle group. (b) Detection of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 protein levels by
  western blotting. β-Actin was used as the internal control. (c) Grayscale analysis
  of the blots. (d) The mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 as measured
  by qRT-PCR. β-Actin was used as the internal control. (e) DCFH-DA staining. Scale
  bar, 200 μm. (f) Quantitative analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity. Data
  are expressed as the means ± SD. ∗P < 0.05vs. the 5-FU alone group; #P < 0.05vs.
  the 5-FU+CBD group.'
