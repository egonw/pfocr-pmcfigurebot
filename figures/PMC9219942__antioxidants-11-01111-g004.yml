caption: Effects of YA treatment on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in INS-1 cells. INS-1
  cells were treated with 40 μM YA and 40 mM glucose for 24 h, the PI3K (A) and phosphorylation
  of Akt473/Akt308 (B) were detected using Western blot. Equal amounts of proteins
  from each sample were separated on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of Akt473/Akt308 was
  probed by p-Akt (Ser 473) and p-Akt (Thr 308) antibody. PI3K was probed by PI3K-p85
  antibody. Total β-actin and Akt were taken as two control groups separately. Values
  are means ± SD from three representative experiments (n = 3). (* p < 0.05 vs. glucose,
  ** p < 0.01 vs. glucose, *** p < 0.001 vs. glucose).
