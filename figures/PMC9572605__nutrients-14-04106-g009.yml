caption: Quercetin regulated myoblast migration through the ITGB1 signaling pathway.
  C2C12 cells were grown to 80% confluency density in a 24-well plate. The cells were
  treated without or with quercetin (0, 12.5 µM) and cultured in DMEM medium containing
  2% horse serum for 15 h to promote cell migration. Western blot analysis was used
  to investigate relative involvement of the related proteins in cell migration with
  GAPDH used as internal control. (A) Western blot images of ITGB1, p-FAK, FAK, p-paxillin,
  and paxillin involvement. (B) Bar graph shows relative protein expression of related
  proteins. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent biological repeats
  (n = 3). The differences between the quercetin-treated group and controls were significant,
  * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001.
