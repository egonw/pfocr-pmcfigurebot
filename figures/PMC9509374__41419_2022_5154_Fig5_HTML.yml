figure_title: Downregulated HM13 inhibits PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in breast cancer
caption: A Western blot assessment of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR protein
  expression was performed in SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 cell lines with siRNAs (si-HM13-1
  and si-HM13-2) or negative control (si-NC). B, D The effects of IGF-1 on cell proliferation
  were detected by CCK-8 (B) and EdU (C, D) assays. SUM1315 and ZR-75-1 cell lines
  were transfected with negative control (si-NC), siRNA (si-HM13) or siRNA and IGF-1
  (si+IGF-1) before harvesting. Scale bars, 50 µm. E, F The wound healing assays were
  performed to determine the migration abilities of SUM1315 (E) and ZR-75-1 (F) transfected
  with negative control (si-NC), siRNA (si-HM13) or siRNA and IGF-1 (si+IGF-1). Scale
  bars, 100 µm. Data were shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

  role in breast cancer by suppressing autophagy and activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
