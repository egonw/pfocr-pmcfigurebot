caption: 'Naringenin considerably mitigated H/R-induced pyroptosis and apoptosis in
  vitro. (a) The obvious elevation of caspase-1 activity in H/R exposure was remarkably
  depressed after naringenin application in renal HK-2 cells. (b) The pretreatment
  of naringenin evidently lessened the mRNA levels of typical pyroptosis-related markers
  including ASC, NLRP3, and caspase-1 during H/R injury. (c, d) The usage of naringenin
  markedly decreased the protein levels of representative pyroptosis-related markers
  such as NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, and caspase-4 after H/R exposure.
  (e, f) The flow cytometry revealed that naringenin administration tremendously mitigated
  H/R-generated apoptotic HK-2 cells. (g) The caspase-3 activity in various groups.
  (h) Western blot analysis utilized in protein detection of HK-2 cells was performed
  to quantify the protein levels of Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, and BAX in various group.
  Values measured during cellular experiments were carried out as mean ± SD, n = 3.
  ∗P < 0.05, compared with the control group; #P < 0.05, versus the DMSO+H/R group.'
