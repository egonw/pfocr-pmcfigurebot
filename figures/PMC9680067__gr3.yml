caption: Nodosome signaling pathways. NOD1 and NOD2 after sensing PAMPs interact with
  RIPK leading to induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-kB pathway. In mammals,
  NOD2 is also reported to interact with TAK1 and GRIM-19 to induce NF-kB pathway.
  NOD1 and NOD2 are involved in synthesis of anti-microbial peptides via ERK and NOD1
  interacts with COP9 signalosome to bring about apoptosis. RIPK also interacts with
  ASC and activate caspase-1 involved in processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  In addition, NOD2 is also seen to interact with MAVS either via RIG-1, MDA5 or directly
  in response to ssRNA virus and might induce IFN gene expression in case of teleosts
  (denoted by red/dotted lines). (PAMPs- pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PGN-peptidoglycan,
