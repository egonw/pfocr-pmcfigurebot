caption: '(1) Production and activation of IL-33 and soluble growth stimulation expressed
  gene 2 (sST2) protein in cardiac tissue consisted of (a) heart, (b) cells, (c) intercellular
  substance and (d) intracellular; (2) The IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway in Blood vessels;
  (3) The schematic diagram of sST2-related diseases: (a) Red-heart disease closely
  related to sST2 (high specificity); (b) Yellow-vascular diseases moderately correlated
  with sST2 (medium specificity) and (c) Bule-the diseases have limited association
  with sST2 (low specificity).'
