caption: Genome-wide WT1 association in renal cancer cells. (a) Table showing data
  and flow of analysis of the ChIP-Seq experiment from sequence reads to annotated
  gene assignment of the WT1-binding sites. (b) Analysis of the motifs associated
  with WT1 peaks showed enrichment for known WT1-binding sequences. (c) Distribution
  of WT1-binding regions in the renal cancer cell genome. (d) Distribution of WT1
  promoter peaks relative to the TSS. (e) WT1-binding motifs identified by ChIP-Seq
  analysis. (f–i) Significantly enriched GO annotations and KEGG pathways of WT1-related
  genes analyzed by DAVID. (f) Biological processes, (g) molecular functions, (h)
  cellular components, and (i) KEGG pathway analysis. (j) The expression level of
  WT1-target genes was verified in WT1-overexpressing cells by RT-qPCR. Experiments
  were conducted in triplicate (n = 3); error bars represent standard errors; ∗∗∗p
  < 0.001.
