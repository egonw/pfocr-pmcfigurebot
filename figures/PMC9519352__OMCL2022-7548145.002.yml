caption: 'KAN0438757 (KAN) alleviated tumor necrosis factor-α- (TNF-α-) induced extracellular
  matrix (ECM) degradation of nucleus pulposus primary (NPP) cells both in vitro and
  in vivo. (a) PFKFB3 expression levels after negative control, TNF-α, TNF-α with
  2.5 μM KAN treatment for 24 hours in NPPs. (b) The gray levels of PFKFB3 were quantified
  and normalized to β-actin using ImageJ. n = 3. (c) Expression of the anabolism and
  catabolism gene matrix metalloproteins (MMPs) 3, 7, 9, and 13 and aggrecan after
  negative control, TNF-α, and TNF-α with 2.5 μM KAN treatment for 24 hours in NPPs.
  n = 3. (d) MMP3 and MMP9 expression levels after negative control, TNF-α, and TNF-α
  with 2.5 μM KAN treatment for 24 hours in NPPs. (e) The gray levels of MMP3 and
  MMP9 were quantified and normalized to β-actin using ImageJ. n = 3. (f) Immunohistochemical
  staining of MMP3 and MMP 9 expressions. Scale bar = 300 μm. (g) Alcian blue staining
  of NP primary cells (P2 generation) on high-density culture after negative control,
  TNF-α, and TNF-α with 2.5 μM KAN treatment for 7 days. Scale bar = 2 mm, 400 μm.
  (h) The integrated optical density (IOD) value was calculated to evaluate the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) of NP primary cells after the indicated treatment. n = 4. Data are
  expressed as mean ± SD. ns: no significance; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.'
