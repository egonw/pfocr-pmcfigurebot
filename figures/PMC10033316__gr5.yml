caption: Effects of GnT-III on TNFα/NF-κB signaling and P-gp expression.A, the expression
  levels of p65 and p-p65 in K562 and K562/ADR cells transfected with or without GnT-III
  were examined by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. B, the expression
  levels of IkBα in the indicated cells were examined by immunoblotting with anti-IkBα
  antibody, and α-tubulin was used as a loading control. Results are presented as
  the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments, one-way ANOVA; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p <
  0.01. C, the K562 and K562/ADR cells were cultured with BAY 11-7082, an inhibitor
  of NF-κB signaling, for 24 h at the indicated concentrations. Equal amounts of cell
  lysates were detected by indicated antibodies, and α-tubulin served as a loading
  control. The relative intensities showed the ratios of either p-p65/p65 or P-gp/α-tubulin
  at each point against the ratio at 0 μM of BAY, which was set as 1. The data were
  presented as the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments, one-way ANOVA; ∗p<
  0.05, ∗∗∗p< 0.001. D, the indicated cells were stimulated with TNFα (5 ng/ml) for
  72 h. The mRNA expression levels of P-gp were analyzed via RT-PCR, and GAPDH was
  used as a loading control. The results are quantitatively presented as the mean ±
  S.E.M of three independent experiments, one-way ANOVA; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. E, the protein
  levels of P-gp were analyzed via Western blot and α-tubulin served as a loading
  control. ADR, adriamycin-resistant; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  GnT-III, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; TNFα, tumor
  necrosis factor α.
