caption: 'Intestinal organoid cultures and the epithelial Notch signaling pathway.
  A: Scheme of intestinal stem cells derived from intestinal crypts developing into
  Matrigel-embedded organoid cultures. B: Scheme of Notch signaling pathway activation
  that is essential for intestinal niche homeostasis. (Figure generated with BioRender.com,
  Cleveland, OH.) ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; Atoh, atonal homolog; Co-A,
  coactivator; Co-R, corepresssor; Hes1, helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor;
  MAML, Mastermind-like coactivator; NECD, extracellular domain; NICD, intracellular
  domain; RBPJ, recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region.'
