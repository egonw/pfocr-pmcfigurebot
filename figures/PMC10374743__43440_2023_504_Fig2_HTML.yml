caption: Warburg effect advantage for cancer cellsâ€”biomass and NADPH production. The
  main metabolic pathways contributing to biomass production in a cancer cell as nucleotide
  synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, serine synthesis, glutaminolysis, cholesterol
  synthesis, and fatty-acid synthesis are presented. In addition, the inhibitors of
  enzymes/proteins involved in the Warburg effect together with their targets are
  presented on the graph. ADP adenosine diphosphate, ATP adenosine triphosphate, GAPDH
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GLUT-1 glucose transporter 1, HK-2 hexokinase-2,
  LDHA lactate dehydrogenase A, MCT-4 monocarboxylate transporter 4, NAD+ nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide, oxidized form, NADH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced
  form, PFKFB3 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3, PKM2 pyruvate
  kinase M2, TCA tricarboxylic acid, THF tetrahydrofolate
