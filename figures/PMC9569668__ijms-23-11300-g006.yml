caption: The effects of AEG-1/miR-221 on HCC cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
  The effects of AEG-1/miR-221 on apoptosis (A) and cell cycle (B) analyzed in the
  miR-221 mimic-, and miR-221 inhibitor-, AEG-1 siRNA-, and their corresponding control-transfected
  HCC cells in vitro by flow cytometry analysis. Error bars presented as the mean
  Â± s.d. and p-values represented as ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared to the corresponding
  controls.
