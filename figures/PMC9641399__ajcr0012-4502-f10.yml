caption: 'Overexpression of integrin β1, FAK and β-catenin increased cell migration.
  (A and B) HCT-8 cell were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-FAK, pcDNA3.1(+)-integrin
  β1, or pcDNA3.1(+)-β-catenin, and wound healing (A) and transwell migration assay
  (B) were assessed at 0 h and 24 h or 48 h, respectively, after treated with 6 μM
  IVM and/or 25 nM VCR. Scale bar = 250 μm. (C) Quantitation of scratch assay as described
  in . (D) Quantitation of transwell migration assay. Cells transfected with empty
  vector pcDNA3.1(+) (mock) served as control. Data in the histograms were presented
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared with their respective
  controls; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, compared with the corresponding columns with the
  same color.'
