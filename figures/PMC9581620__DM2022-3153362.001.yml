caption: Polarization and YTHDF2 levels in M1/M2 macrophages. (a) LPS+ INF-γ and (b)
  IL-4 were utilized to treat M0 macrophages for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h, separately. IL-1β,
  IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, TGF-β, iNOS, ARG1, and FIZZ levels were analyzed through qRT-PCR,
  with GAPDH being the endogenous reference. (c, d) IL-6 and TNF-α production in M1
  cells, together with IL-10 and TGF-β levels within M2 cells, were detected through
  ELISA. (e) CD16/32, CD86, CD206, F4/80, and DECTIN-1 expression were determined
  through FCM in M0/M1/M2 cells. (f) YTHDF2 mRNA level was measured through qRT-PCR
  following treatment of M0 cells with LPS + INF-γ, with GAPDH being the endogenous
  reference. (g) YTHDF2 protein expression detected through western blotting after
  treated M0 cells with LPS+ INF-γ, with β-actin being the endogenous reference. (h)
  YTHDF2 mRNA expression quantified through qRT-PCR after treated M0 cells with IL-4,
  with GAPDH being the endogenous reference. (i) YTHDF2 protein expression measured
  through western blotting after treated M0 cells with IL-4, with β-actin being the
  endogenous reference. Results are demonstrated by mean ± S.E.M. (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05;
  ∗∗P < 0.01.
