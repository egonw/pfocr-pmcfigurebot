caption: The ASFV I10L protein interacts with IKKβ, NEMO and NF-κB. (A) The ASFV pI10L
  functions at or upstream of p65. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pNF-κB-Fluc
  (0.1 µg), pRL-TK (0.01 µg), the plasmids expressing the indicated proteins (TRADD,
  MYD88, TRAF6, TAK1, TAB1, IKKβ, and p65) (0.05 µg), the empty vector or pFlag-pI10L
  (0.04 µg) for 20 hours, followed by luciferase assay. (B and C) The ASFV pI10L interacts
  with IKKβ, NEMO, p65, and p50. HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmids
  pHA-IKKβ, -NEMO, -p65, or -p50, and pFlag-pI10L for 20 hours, and then lysed for
  co-IP with anti-HA or anti-Flag MAb, followed by immunoblotting analysis. (D) The
  ASFV pI10L binds to IKKβ, NEMO, p65, and p50 in vitro. The recombinant GST-tagged
  pI10L was incubated with the HA-tagged IKKβ, NEMO, p65, or p50, followed by immunoblotting
  analysis. (E) The ASFV pI10L interacts with the endogenous IKKβ, NEMO, p65, and
  p50. The PK-15 cells stably expressing pI10L were left untreated or treated with
  TNF-α (20 ng/mL) for 30 minutes and then lysed for co-IP with anti-Flag MAb, followed
  by immunoblotting analysis. (F) The ASFV pI10L were co-localized with IKKβ, NEMO,
  p65, and p50 mainly in the cytoplasm. The PK-15 cells stably expressing the ASFV
  pI10L were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to confocal microscopy.
  The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to indicate the co-localization
  between IKKβ, NEMO, p65, or p50 (red) and Flag-pI10L (green). Data shown are the
  mean ± SD from one representative experiment performed in triplicates. ***P < 0.001
  (unpaired t test).
