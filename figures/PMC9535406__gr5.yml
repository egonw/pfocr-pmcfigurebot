caption: The regulatory roles of Tgfb1 in formation of the cerebellar primordium during
  early developmental stages at E9-E13.Based on the neurogenesis timing of the cerebellum,
  the only postmitotic neural populations that exist in the cerebellar primordium
  between E9 to E13 are the Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons located at
  the Purkinje cell plate and nuclear transitory zone, respectively. Expression of
  active Tgfb1 is intensely high at earliest embryonic days at both E9 and E10, followed
  by a substantial reduction in its value from E11 to E13. Our study shows that Tgfb1
  through the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway could upregulate the expression of
  CAMs. On the other hand, activation of the Tgf-β signaling pathway and its consequent
  reduction in available Tgfb1 amounts, autophagic-flux, which the Tgf-β1 regularly
  induces, is inhibited from E9 to E13. A) Activation of the Smad-dependent Tgf-β1
  signaling pathway in the mouse cerebellar primordium at E9-E13; Our finding showed
  the presence of main components of the canonical Tgf-β signaling pathway, including
  Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2and cytoplasmic total and phosphorylated Smad signaling molecules
  during the given embryonic period. B) Tgfb1 upregulates the expression of Cadherins
  in the mouse cerebellar primordium at E9-E13; Tgfb1 by upregulating the expression
  of cell adhesion proteins, including cdh2, Cdh8, Ncam, and cadherin binding protein
  β-catenin (Ctnnb1), contribute to the physical interactions and connectivity between
  postmitotic Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons, locating in the Purkinje
  cell plate and nuclear transitory zone during earliest developmental stages from
  E9 to E13 with a peak at E11. These data show the direct association between upregulation
  of both Cdh2 and Ctnnb1, Cdh8 and Ncam upon activation of the Tgf-β signaling pathway,
  correlated to time points during which Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons
  are born, migrating and positioning in cerebellar primordium. C) Tgfb1 inhibits
  autophagic-flux in the mouse cerebellar primordium at E9-E13; Tgfb1, by regulating
  the autophagic-flux, responds to the extracellular signals such as stress (starvation,
  hypoxia, aggregation of unwanted materials) to maintain cellular homeostasis and
  provide neural protection during cerebellar development. The results from our study
  pinpoint a potential regulatory role of autophagy inhibition by Smad-dependent Tgf-β
  signaling pathway in the formation of the Purkinje cell plate and accumulation of
  cerebellar nuclei neurons in nuclear transitory zone during early cerebellar development.
