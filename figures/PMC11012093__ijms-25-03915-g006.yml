caption: BMP2 upregulates the transcriptional activity of PPARγ through MAPK and AKT/mTOR
  signaling. (A) Schematic diagram of RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and MKK3,6-P38 signaling pathway.
  (B–D) Expression levels of the genes involved in the Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway. 18S was used as an internal control, n = 6. (E) Representative Western
  blot shows the total protein and phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 on day 2 after
  induction. β-Tubulin was used as a loading control. (F) Data quantification of panel
  (E), where n = 3. (G) Expression levels of the genes involved in the MKK3,6-P38
  signaling pathway, where n = 6. (H) Representative Western blot showing the total
  protein and phosphorylation levels of P38 on day 2 after induction. (I) Data quantification
  of panel (H), where n = 3. (J) Representative Western blot and quantification of
  the panel showing the total protein and phosphorylation levels of AKT and S6K in
  rhBMP2-treated cells, where n = 4. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM, **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. (K) Western blot showing the total protein and phosphorylation
  levels in rhBMP2- and T0070907-treated cells.
