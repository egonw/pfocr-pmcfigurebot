caption: 'NF-κB, NLRP3, and cGAS–STING pathway activity of the aortas in response
  to acute and recurrent hypoglycemia in aged T2DM rats. (a) p-p65, NLRP3, ASC, (b)
  cleaved caspase-1, cGAS, and (e) STING expression were assayed by western blotting.
  The expression and location of NLRP3 were determined by (c) immunohistochemistry
  and (d) immunofluorescence; ∗p < 0.05 DM vs. control; #p < 0.05 H-DM, RH-DM vs.
  DM; &p < 0.05 H-DM vs. RH-DM.'
