caption: DOX and colon cancer cell viability affect different times (6, 24, and 72
  h). Three DOX concentration (0, control; 0.75 µg/mL; 1.5 µg/mL; and 7.5 µg/mL) at
  three time points were recorded. At least 6 replicates were used for each tested
  concentration. The bar graphs show 0, black; 0.75 µg/mL, blue; 1.5 µg/mL, green;
  and 7.5 µg/mL, red. Tested with 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test,
  significant adjusted p < 0.05. * and ** represent p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively.
