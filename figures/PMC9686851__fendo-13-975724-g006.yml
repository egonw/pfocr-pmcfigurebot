caption: 'Effects of MCDD on insulin resistance in PCOS-IR rats. (A) Fasting blood
  glucose of rats was measured by glucose oxidase method after fasting for 12 hours,
  (B) FINS, (C) HOMA-IR, (D) ISI, (E, F) OGTT area under the curve, the changes of
  serum IR-related indexes of rats were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
  kit. (G–J) four blood lipid biochemical indicator were measured by automatic biochemical
  analyzer. The above results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 8~12. ***P < 0.001,
  **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, vs. control group, ###P < 0.001, ##P < 0.01, #P < 0.05, vs.
  model group.'
