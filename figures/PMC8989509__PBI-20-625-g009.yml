caption: Outline of cytokinin biosynthetic and signal transduction pathway. Cytokinin
  riboside 5' monophosphates (cytokinin mononucleotides) are converted in one step
  by LONELY GUY (LOG) to the active cytokinin free bases (cytokinin nucleobases).
  In the putative two‐step process, ‘?’ refers to the paucity of support for cytokinin‐specific
  nucleotidases to convert the cytokinin nucleotides to ribosides, and ‘??’ refers
  similarly for cytokinin‐specific nucleosidases to convert cytokinin ribosides to
  nucleobases. Back conversion of nucleobases to nucleotides can occur via adenine
  phosphoribosyl transferase (APT1; Witte and Herde, ) and of ribosides to nucleotides
  by adenosine kinase (AK; Sakakibara, ). Cytokinin signal transduction is mediated
  by a two‐component system (TCS), consisting of histidine protein kinase receptors
  that sense the input and response regulators (RR) that mediate the output (Wang
  and Sheen, ). Cytokinin free bases are detected by histidine‐kinase receptors (HKs)
  on the ER (Romanov et al., ) or plasma membrane (Antoniadi et al., ; Kubiasova et al.,
  ). Signal transduction is via a phospho relay with phosphate being transferred from
  the HKs by intermediary histidine phospho transfer proteins (HPs) leading to phosphorylation
  of type‐B response regulators (type‐B RRs) in the nucleus. The type‐B RRs are Myb‐type
  transcription factors that regulate transcription of primary response genes, leading
  to cytokinin responses. Negative regulator type‐A RRs are also transcribed (Zubo
  and Schaller, ). It should be noted that, while the essential TCS appears to be
  the same in monocots and dicots, rice also has a novel serine/threonine kinase receptor
  known as CHARK (Ito and Kurata, ; Halawa et al., ). Additionally, some rice RRs
  have acquired novel functions distinct from their roles in dicots (Worthen et al.,
  ). A detailed figure of cytokinin biosynthesis and metabolism can be viewed in Chen
  et al. (), and a model of the signal transduction pathway in Romanov et al. ().
