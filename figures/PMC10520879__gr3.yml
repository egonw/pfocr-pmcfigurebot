caption: CircSOBP inhibits glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in glioma cells(A)
  Heatmap of pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites in circSOBP overexpression
  group (pEGFP-C1-circSOBP) and control group (pEGFP-C1) of U87 cells.(B) Concentrations
  of pyruvate and lactate between circSOBP overexpression group and control cells.(C)
  Concentrations of pyruvate and lactate between circSOBP-silenced and control cells.(D)
  Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) indicators, including basal respiration and ATP production
  levels, were measured in U87 and U251 cells after overexpression of circSOBP.(E)
  Overexpression of circSOBP in U87 and U251 cells and detection of extracellular
  acidification rate (ECAR) as an indicator of inferred glycolytic flux and glycolytic
  capacity.(F) Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was used as an indicator of oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to detect basal respiration and ATP production levels after
  silencing of circSOBP in U87 and U251 cells.(G) Extracellular acidification rate
  (ECAR) was used as an index to infer glycolytic flux and glycolytic capacity to
  detect knockdown of circSOBP in U87 and U251 cells. All statistics of error bars,
  S.E.M. from three independent experiments. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 by two-tailed Student’s t test.
