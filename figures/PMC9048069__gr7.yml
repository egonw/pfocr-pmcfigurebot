caption: BTC stimulates phosphorylation of mutant EGFR, and only mutant, but not wild-type,
  EGFR can induce transformation(A) NIH3T3 cells expressing empty vector, wild-type
  EGFR, or the indicated EGFR mutants were serum-starved for 12 h. They were then
  stimulated with BTC (10 ng/mL) for 30 min and analyzed for the indicated EGFR phosphorylation
  sites. Total EGFR and ACTB were used as loading control.(B) PC9 cells were infected
  with lentiviral particles expressing non-specific (NS) sgRNA or two sequence-independent
  EGFR sgRNAs. Immunoblotting for phosho-EGFR, total EGFR, and ACTB is shown.(C) PC9
  cells with NS or EGFR sgRNAs were infected with empty vector or wild-type or mutant
  EGFR and analyzed for the indicated proteins by immunoblotting. ACTB was used as
  a loading control.(D) PC9 cells with NS or EGFR sgRNAs were infected with empty
  vector or wild-type or mutant EGFR or both wild-type and mutant EGFR and analyzed
  in a soft agar assay. Representative images of the well and microscopic images are
  shown. Scale bar, 200 μm.(E) Relative colony size for the data presented in panel
  (D). Data are shown as the mean ±SEM ns = not significant, ∗∗p<0.01, ∗∗∗p<0.001,
  ∗∗∗∗p<0.0001.
