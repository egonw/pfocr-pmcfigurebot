caption: RPCs lose Notch activity after PF treatment and increase in photoreceptor
  fate. (A) Schematic of the Notch signaling pathway before and after treatment with
  PF. (B) Quantitative PCR data are shown for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and
  human induced pluripotent stem cell lines after post-treatment day 14 as log2 fold
  change compared with control organoids for HES1, HES5, VSX2, and OTX2 (n = 5 organoids
  per line, 3 biological replicates). (C–Fʹ) Bright-field and green fluorescent protein
  (GFP) expression observation in early retinal organoid generated from CRXp-GFP H9
  hESCs. PF treatment started at D45. After 14 days, PF-treated (Dʹ) organoids expressed
  more CRXp-GFP than their control counterparts (Cʹ). This was also the case after
  42 days (Eʹ, Fʹ). Scale bar, 50 µm. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, ****P <
  0.001. All statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett
  test to correct for multiple comparisons in GraphPad Prism 9 software. See also  for
  DAPT data. Ctrl, control.
