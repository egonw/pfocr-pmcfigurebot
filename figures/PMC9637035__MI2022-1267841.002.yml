caption: 'PQQ administration inhibits Th2 cell differentiation. CD4+ T cells were
  primed under Th2 conditions. PQQ and DXM were added. Five days later, the cells
  were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. The Th2 cytokines were measured using an
  ELISA kit. The columns and error bars represent the means and SEMs (n = 3 per group).
  ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01; ns: not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained
  in three independent experiments.'
