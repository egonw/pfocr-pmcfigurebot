caption: 'Effect of LBAG on the expression of autophagy and PI3K/AKT pathway-related
  proteins in H9c2 cells with H/R injury. (a) p62 expression was detected by immunofluorescence
  analysis in LBAG-treated H/R-injured H9c2 cells. Scale bar: 50 μm. (b, c) p62, LC3,
  Beclin 1, and PI3K/AKT pathway-related protein levels were estimated with western
  blotting in LBAG-treated H/R-injured H9c2 cells. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control
  group. ▲P < 0.05 and ▲▲P < 0.01 vs. H/R group. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 vs. 10 μmol/L
  LBAG group.'
