caption: Prognostic significance analysis of the Alzheimer’s disease testing dataset.
  (A) Kaplan–Meier curve to compare OS of high risk with low-risk samples (p < 0.001);
  (B) forest plot of multivariate independent prognostic analysis. The square on the
  horizontal line shows the hazard ratio (HR), and the horizontal line represents
  the 95% confidence interval; (C) time-dependent receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) curve analysis of the risk score model for predicting 3- and 5-year OS; and
  (D) multi-index ROC curve. The curve area is used to assess the accuracy of the
  risk model (model AUC = 0.737).
