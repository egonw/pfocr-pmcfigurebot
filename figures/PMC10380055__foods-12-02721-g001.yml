caption: 'The biosynthesis pathway of caffeine in tea plants. The core pathways for
  caffeine synthesis in tea plants are shown as I. The synthesis pathways of xanthosine
  in tea plants are shown as II. Arrows represent the synthetic routes. Note: PRPP,
  5-phosphoribose-1-pyrophosphate; IMP, 5′-monophosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
  XMP, xanthosine-5′monophosphate; GMP, guanosine 5′-Monophosphate; SAH, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine;
  and SAM, S-adenosyl-L-methionine.'
