caption: Characterization of the T cells and NK cells. (A) Box plot showing the degree
  of T cell activation, cytokine activity, cytokine receptor activity, and intrinsic
  apoptotic signaling pathway in CD8 c2 from three experimental groups. (B-E) Box
  plot representing the degree of NK cell activation (B), cytokine activity (C), cytokine
  receptor activity (D), and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (E) in NK cell
  subclusters from three experimental groups. (F-H) Dot plot showing the key cytotoxicity-related
  genes of CD8 c2 (F), NK c1 (G), and NK c2 (H) upregulated in group 3.
