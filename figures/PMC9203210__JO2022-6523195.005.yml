caption: 'CHRM1 induces autophagy-mediated migration and invasion by targeting Atg5
  in prostate cancer cells. (a–c) Determination of the autophagy-associated genes
  by western blotting and qPCR. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001. (d, g)
  Determination of efficiency of knocking out of Atg5 by Western blotting and qPCR.
  Data in western blot and qPCR are means ± SD (n = 3); ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
  (e, h) Determination and quantification of autophagy-related proteins in PC‐3-sh-NC
  and sh-Atg5 cells treated with CAR by western blotting. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗∗P < 0.001;
  and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001. (f, i) Determination and quantification of the expressions of
  E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin in PC‐3 sh-NC and sh-Atg5 cells treated with
  CAR by western blotting. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001; and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
  (j, k) Images of migration and invasion of the three tumor cell lines upon sh-NC,
  sh-Atg5, or sh-Atg5+CAR administration. Scale bar: 1 mm. (l–n) Quantification of
  migrated (invade) cell numbers in the cell migration (invasion) assays. Cells were
  counted in five random fields per section. ∗∗P < 0.01.'
