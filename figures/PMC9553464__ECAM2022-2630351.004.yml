caption: Knockdown of KRT80 inhibits TGF-β/SMAD signaling in NSCLC cells. (a) The
  relationship between the expression of KRT80 and TGFBR1 in adrenocortical carcinoma
  (ACC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and thyroid carcinoma (THCA)
  was explored using the UALCAN data analysis platform (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html).
  (b) The Western blot assessed protein levels in NSCLC cells.  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 and  ∗ ∗ ∗P
  < 0.001.
