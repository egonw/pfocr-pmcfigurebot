caption: Characterization of BAT transcriptome in response to cold and fasting(A and
  B) K-means clustering of DEGs followed by KEGG pathway analysis in (A) RT vs Cold
  (n = 3) and (B) RT (Fed) vs Fasting (n = 3) in K15 F/F control mice.(C) KEGG pathway
  for thermogenesis highlighting downregulated genes in K15 F/F Fasting condition
  in red and green.(D) Klf15 expression data mined from CircaDB showing similar rhythmic
  oscillations in BAT, liver, and skeletal muscle.(E) Relative BAT Klf15 expression
  in room temperature (RT) vs cold (n = 3–4). Data represent mean ± SEM. Comparisons
  between groups were performed using an unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t test. ∗p < 0.05,
  ∗∗p < 0.01.
