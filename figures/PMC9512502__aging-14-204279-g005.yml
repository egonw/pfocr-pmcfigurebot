caption: 'Induced p-CREB promotes CXCR4 transcription by targeting the CXCR4 promoter.
  The potential CREB targeting site in CXCR4 promoter (A). Cells were first transfected
  with CXCR4 promoter driven luciferase reporter for 24h and then incubated with 5
  nM MSP for 30 mins. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System was used to detect the
  luciferase activity (B). After activation of MSP, Chromatin immunoprecipitation
  (ChIP)-PCR was performed to show that p-CREB bound to the putative promoter of CXCR4
  in 5637 cells (C). Data were presented as mean Â± SD from three independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05 versus mlgG treatment. WT: wild type; Mut: mutant type.'
