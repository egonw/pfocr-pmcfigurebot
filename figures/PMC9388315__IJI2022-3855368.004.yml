caption: 'Effect of different concentrations of Cinnamon aqueous extract on 5637cell.
  (a) The image of protein extraction by the immunoblotting result, (b) HSF1, and
  (c) LDHA protein expression. Data are reported as the mean ± SD and each value is
  the average of at least three independent replicates. (∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 compared to the control group). HSF1: heat-shock transcription factor1,
  LDHA: lactate dehydrogenase A.'
