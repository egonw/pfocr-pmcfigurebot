caption: Examination of DNA repair by strand displacement synthesis and the long-patch
  (LP) BER pathway. The multiply damaged substrate and potential restriction endonuclease
  cut sites are shown with the top middle oligonucleotide. Repair was initiated in
  the upper strand by hyTDG (A, lane 3) or in the lower strand by hOGG1 (B, lane 3).
  Following repair, substrates were probed with restriction endonucleases. Cleavage
  by HpaII (A, lane 9) confirmed that the T:G mispair was converted to C:G. Cleavage
  by HaeII (B, lane 9) confirmed that the 8oxoG:C was repaired to G:C.
