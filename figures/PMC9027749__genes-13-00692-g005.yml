caption: 'Effect of Med12 on the TGFβ signaling pathway. (A) MOVAS were translated
  with si-control or si-Med12 for 72 h, and the expressions of Tgfβ1 were detected
  by RT-PCR. (B) MOVAS were incubated with TGFβ1(4 ng/mL) for 72 h, and Western blot
  detected the expression of Med12 and Pcna. (C) Same experiment as in (A); the TGFβR2-phosphorylated
  Smad2 (p-Smad2) relative to total Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) relative
  to total Smad3, as detected by Western blot. (D) Same experiment as in (A), Western
  blot was used to analyze p-ERK/ERK. The experiment was repeated at least three times.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses, unpaired t-test. * p < 0.05;
  **** p < 0.0001. ns: not significant.'
