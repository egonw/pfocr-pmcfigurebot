caption: Signaling pathways and genes altered in CRC progression. (A) Changes in signaling
  pathways as CRC developed in sample S115 by GSVA analysis. (B) Spatial distribution
  and expression trend of ribosome pathway in S115. (C) RPL5 (left) and IMP3 (right)
  expression gradually increased in the direction of the red arrow. (D) Spatial distribution
  and expression trend of antigen processing and presentation pathway in S115. (E)
  HLA-A (left) and HSPA2 (right) expression gradually increased in the direction of
  the blue arrow. (F, G) Expression direction of peroxisome pathway (F) and leucine
  and isoleucine degradation pathway (G) in S115. (H, I) Immunohistochemical staining
  showed expression of RPL5 (H) and HLA-A (I) in Mucosa and cancer(up) and Invasive
  margin(down) (n=45). The scale bars on the lower right in (H), (I) are 100 µm.
