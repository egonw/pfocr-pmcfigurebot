figure_title: RP1-59D14.5 affects PCa cell progression via regulating CK1
caption: A RT-qPCR and western blot detected the level of CK1 in cells transfected
  with sh/CK1. B Rescue experiments were conducted in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1
  or pcDNA3.1/RP1-59D14.5 or pcDNA3.1/RP1-59D14.5+sh/CK1. C The effect of RP1-59D14.5
  overexpression on protein synthesis of YAP was evaluated after CHX treatment. D,
  E Colony formation and EdU assays assessed the proliferation of PCa cells. F Transwell
  assays detected the invasion and migration of transfected PCa cells. G The dots
  of GFP and mRFP in differently transfected cells were detected via IF and quantified
  via RT-qPCR. Scale bar = 10 μm. H Western blot measured the levels of p62, LAMP1,
  LC3-I/II. GAPDH serves as an internal control. **P < 0.01.
