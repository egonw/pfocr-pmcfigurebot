caption: Smad7 was the target of miR-520h and regulated the EMT. (A) Venn diagram
  of the intersection among target genes by miRmap, Starbase, TargetScan and miRDB.
  (B) RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that nitroxoline led to increased smad7 expression.
  (C) Western-blotting assay demonstrated that nitroxoline up-regulated the expression
  of smad7, contributing to the repression of smad2/3 and EMT. (D) Dual luciferase
  assay showed the direct binding of miR-520h and 3'UTR of smad7 mRNA. (E) The exogenous
  dysregulation of miR-520h influence the expression of smad7, smad2/3 and EMT markers.
  (F and G) RT-qPCR and western blotting assay indicated the inhibition of smad7 after
  the transfection of smad7-si. (H and I) The capacity of migration was rescued by
  the decrease of smad7, which was inhibited by miR-520h-inhibitor. *P<0.05, **P<0.01
  and ***P<0.001.
