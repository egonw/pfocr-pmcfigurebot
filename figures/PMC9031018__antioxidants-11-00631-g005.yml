caption: KEGG analyses of DE mRNAs. Enrichment and screening of KEGG pathway in the
  C group and the P group resulted in 316 signaling pathways on top of KEGG enrichment
  MAPK, Hippo, osteoclast differentiation, TNF signaling pathway, and other signaling
  pathways (A,D,G). A total of 321 signal pathways were obtained by enrichment and
  screening of the KEGG pathway in the C group and the P + Q group, which, on top
  of KEGG enrichment, mainly involved MAPK, TGF-βα and others signaling pathways (B,E,H).
  Moreover, 249 signal pathways were obtained by enrichment and screening of the KEGG
  pathway in the P group and the P + Q group, on top of KEGG enrichment, which mainly
  involved RNA transport, AMPK, HIF-1, the VEGF signaling pathway and other signal
  pathways (C,F,I).
