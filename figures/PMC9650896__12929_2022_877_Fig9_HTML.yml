caption: Schematic summary of thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 expression signaling pathway
  involving DCLK1 in lung epithelial cells. It has previously been revealed that thrombin-induced
  ERK activation increases IKKα/β phosphorylation, which promotes p65 to translocate
  to the nucleus from the cytosol, resulting in IL-8/CXCL8 expression. In this report,
  DCLK1 is involved in thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 expression via ERK and then mediates
  the activation of RhoA and YAP. Once YAP is activated, it moves to nucleus from
  cytosol, where it binds to the transcription factor p65, increasing IL-8/CXCL8 expression
  in human lung epithelial cells. This image was created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/)
