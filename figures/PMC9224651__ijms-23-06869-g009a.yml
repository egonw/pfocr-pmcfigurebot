caption: KEGG enrichment analysis P value histogram. The abscissa represents the metabolic
  pathway, the red in the ordinate represents the enrichment p value of differential
  metabolites, and the green represents the enrichment p value of the differential
  gene, which is represented by -log (p value), the higher the ordinate, the higher
  the degree of enrichment. (a) HN65; (b) HN44.
