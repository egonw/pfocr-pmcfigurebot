caption: 'Receptor‐interacting protein kinase (RIPK3) IHC provides insights about
  the necroptosis pathway. (A) Confocal fluorescent images showing DAPI (blue) and
  RIPK3 (red) expression in PBS, nonactivated MSCs, and activated MSCs. Scale bar
  = 10 μm. (B) Immunoreactive score (IRS) reveals significant decrease in RIPK3 expression
  in activated MSC tissue. Three representative paraffin‐embedded liver tissues were
  stained for each group. (C) Western blot showing RIP3 expression in activated MSC–treated
  and PBS‐treated mice groups. RIP3 expression is decreased in the activated MSC group
  compared with the PBS control group. (D) Western blot showing expression of B cell
  lymphoma 2 (BCL‐2). Activated MSC–treated group shows highest expression of BCL‐2
  compared with PBS and nonactivated MSC groups. (E) BCL‐2 promoter is regulated by
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate response element‐binding protein (CREB1) binding sites. (F) Western
  blot showing a reduced cleaved Gasdermin D (GSDMD) expression in activated MSC–treated
  mice. Cleaved GSDMD was highly expressed in both nonactivated and PBS‐treated mice.
  (G) Proposed hypothetical mechanism. *: p < 0.05, **: P = < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001.'
