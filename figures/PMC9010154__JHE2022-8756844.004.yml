caption: AIM2 knockdown suppresses excessive MAPK signaling activity. (∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, Data obtained from three independent are represented as means and standard
  errors.) (a-d) ERK, JNK, and P38 phosphorylation levels were assessed via Western
  blotting in BGC823 and MGC803 cells, with GAPDH as a normalization control. AIM2
  facilitates GC tumor progression in vivo.
