caption: 'Construction of a seven-gene risk score. (a) Volcano plot showed the DEGs
  between normal and tumor samples in TCGA. (b) Venn plot showed the overlapping genes
  between DEGs and NF-κB-related genes. (c) The parameters of LASSO algorithm. (d–f).
  Survival analysis of the risk score in (d) discovery cohort and (e, f) validation
  cohort. (g–i). Risk score, survival status, survival time in (g) TCGA, (h) GSE84437,
  and (i) GSE62254 dataset. (j–l). The expression of the seven hub genes in (j) TCGA,
  (k) GSE84437, and (l) GSE62254 dataset. DEGs: differentially expressed genes; TCGA:
  The Cancer Genome Atlas; LASSO: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.'
