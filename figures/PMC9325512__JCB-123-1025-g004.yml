caption: Major EMT‐dependent mechanisms involved in the regulation of immune checkpoints
  and tumor immune escape. (A) Driving EMT by hypoxia in tumor cells upregulates the
  expression of CCL20 and Such upregulation increases IDO in macrophages. IDO induces
  a metabolic switch in macrophages and increases Foxp3+ Treg cells. (B) In mesenchymal
  breast cancer cells, ZEB‐1 strongly induces PD‐L1 expression. (C) The EMT‐TFs SNAI1
  and ZEB1 upregulate CD47 by direct binding of these EMT‐TFs to the E‐boxes in the
  human CD47 promoter. (D) Driving EMT by TGF‐β decreases the level of DNA‐methyltransferase
  1 (DNMT1), resulting in PD‐L1 promoter demethylation. Driving EMT by TNF‐α induces
  NF‐κB pathway and promotes the expression of demethylated PD‐L1 promoter. EMT, epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal
  transition; IDO, indoleamine 2, 3‐dioxygenase; TF, transcription factor.
