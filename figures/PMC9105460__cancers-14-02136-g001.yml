caption: Simplified representation of immunotherapeutic strategies in HER2-positive
  breast cancer (A). Monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab) and antibody–drug
  conjugates (ADCs) (e.g., T-DM1, T-DXd, SYD985) exert both a direct anti-tumor effect,
  by blocking and modulating the HER2 signaling, but also an indirect effect, by activating
  the immune system through the so-called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
  (ADCC) (B). ADCC consists of the cellular lysis of tumor cells induced by immune
  effectors via an antibody targeting action that involves the FcR signaling. In other
  words, antibodies can recognize and bind to antigens expressed on the surface of
  tumor cells and create a “bridge” between the tumor cell and the immune effector
  cells expressing Fc-gamma receptors. The immune cell activated via the FcR signaling
  releases lytic enzymes (i.e., granzyme B, perforin) able to induce the apoptosis
  of the tumor cell. ADCs are composed of an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, bound
  via a linker (cleavable or not) to a cytotoxic agent. Hence, their anti-tumor properties
  consist not only in the blockade of the HER2 signaling pathway and ADCC induction,
  but also in the internalization of the cytotoxic agent by HER2 expressing cells,
  with a consequent more potent cytotoxic effect within tumor cells and less toxicity
  on healthy tissue. (C) reports a simplified representation of the therapeutic vaccines
  under development for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (protein-based,
  cell-based, gene-based, and viral vector-based vaccines).
