caption: Proteomics and clinical data indicating that ginsenoside Rh4 targeted SIX1,
  suppressing EMT in GC. (A) Correlation heatmap of samples. (B) Principal component
  analysis (PCA) of significantly regulated proteins in the HGC-27 groups with or
  without Rh4 treatment (n = 3 biologically independent experiments). (C)Volcano plot
  analysis for the Rh4 treatment/control comparisons. Proteins regulated on the proteome
  level are marked in red (upregulated) and green (downregulated). Q15475 represents
  the SIX1 protein. (D) Heatmap hierarchical clustering from differentially expressed
  proteins (n = 218) identified across all sample groups. Q15475 represents the SIX1
  protein. (E) Statistics of KEGG pathway enrichment. (F) TCGA analysis of SIX1 expression
  levels in GC tissues and paracancerous tissues (** p < 0.01). (G) Survival curves
  synthesized using Kaplan–Meier method.
