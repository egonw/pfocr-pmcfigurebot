caption: Effects of chronic ethanol and dietary soy isolate on Morris Water Maze (MWM)
  performance. MWM tests were run during the final week (Week 7) of the experiment,
  over 4 consecutive days with 3 trials per day per rat. Latencies to locate and land
  on the platform and swim velocities were video tracked and recorded, and results
  were analyzed using Ethovision 8.5. (A) Calculated area-under-curve data for latencies
  measured over the three daily trials were used for inter-group comparisons. (B)
  Swim velocities averaged over the 3 daily trials per rat were used for inter-group
  comparisons. Data from male and female rats were combined since sex differences
  were not observed. The two-way ANOVA test demonstrated significant effects of Trial
  Day and treatment (ethanol diet and soy isolate) on latency but not velocity ().
  In Panel A, the graphed data (mean ± S.D.) show progressive declines in latency
  for all groups, and significant effects of dietary soy isolate for reducing mean
  AUC latencies on Trial Days 1, 3, and 4 (* p < 0.05). Panel B shows no significant
  time-course or experimental group effects on velocity.
