caption: Summary of PCa knockout models due to inhibition of TP53 and DNA repair signaling
  pathways. In normal conditions, TP53 levels are at their low steady-state concentration.
  In the presence of metabolic stress or genomic damage—such as a lack of nucleotides,
  presence of UV radiation, ionizing radiation, oncogene signaling, hypoxia, or blockage
  of transcription—TP53 levels rapidly accumulate. As the guardian of the genome,
  TP53 regulates processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis; TP53
  itself is activated by Chk1 and inhibited by Mdm2. The DNA repair stimulated by
  TP53 can itself be identified as its own signaling pathway. One component of the
  DNA repair pathway includes MGMT/AGT, which removes methyl and ethyl adducts from
  the O6 position of guanine. Excision pathways such as nucleotide-excision repair
  and base-excision repair can be stimulated in response to single-stranded DNA breaks.
  With the help of proteins such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, double-stranded DNA breaks can
  be repaired via either homology-directed repair or non-homologous end joining. Created
