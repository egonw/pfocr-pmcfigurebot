caption: 'Mean classical complement pathway activity from baseline up to 51 weeks
  afer sutimlimab treatment in patients with cold agglutinin disease (full analysis
  set). Classical pathway activity and C4 levels are shown. The number of patients
  varied by study visit and by analyte in this interim analysis as the study is ongoing.
  The data cutoff date was 16 January, 2020. Classical pathway activation was determined
  using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that measures the functional capacity
  of the classical pathway (Wieslab® classical complement pathway assay; normal range
  in serum is 69–129%.). The standard international reference range for serum C4 is
  0.18 to 0.45 g/L. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at 3-month intervals
  during the first year of treatment in part B and then at 6-month intervals. Bsl:
  baseline; SE: standard error.'
