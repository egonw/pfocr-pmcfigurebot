caption: 'The active sites of SbFNR1, FNR2, and PvDFRa with bound ligands. Ligands
  are shown in grey, NADP is shown in black, interacting residues are shown in white,
  hydrogen bonds are shown via dashed lines, oxygen is shown in red, and nitrogen
  is shown in blue, and the density covering the ligand is displayed in grey mesh
  using the Fo-Fc map. (A) the complex crystal structure of SbFNR1 with naringenin
  and NADP+ (PDBID: 8FEU); (B) the complex crystal structure of SbFNR1 with DHQ and
  NADP+ (PDBID: 8FEV); (C) the complex crystal structure of SbFNR2 with naringenin
  and NADP+ (PDBID: 8FIO). (D) the complex crystal structure of PvDFRa with DHQ and
  NADP+ (PDBID: 8FEN). Electron density is shown at 1.1 RMSD contour level. Molecular
  graphics images were produced using the ChimeraX package (UCSF).'
