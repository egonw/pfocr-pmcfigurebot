caption: m6A RNA binding proteins participate in ESCA progression in an m6A-independent
  way. (A) Ref. [] YTHDC2 inhibited proliferation of ESCC cells through changing expression
  of some genes enriched in p53 signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway; (B) Ref. [] IGF2BP1 and UHRF2 interacted to promote
  proliferation and invasion of ESCC cells and inhibit apoptosis of ESCC cells, which
  mediated regulation of miR-98-5p on biological phenotype of ESCC cells; (C) Ref.
  [] miR-454-3p suppressed ERK and AKT signaling pathway by targeting IGF2BP1, then
  inhibited proliferation and invasion of ESCC cells; (D) Ref. [] HNRNPA2B1 facilitated
  ESCC progression by accelerating fatty acid synthesis via increasing expression
  of ACLY and ACC1; (E) Ref. [] miR-186 inhibited malignant behavior of ESCC cells
  by downregulating expression of HNRNPC; (F) Ref. [] EIF3H promoted the proliferation,
  migration and invasion of ESCC cells through increasing stability of Snail protein;
  (G) Ref. [] EIF3B cooperated with TEX9 to promote malignant phenotype of ESCC cells
  via activating AKT signaling pathway; (H) Ref. [] EIF3B promoted proliferation and
  invasion of ESCC cells and inhibited apoptosis of ESCC cells through activating
  Î²-catenin signaling pathway; (I) Ref. [] Knockdown of EIF3E repressed proliferation
  and migration of ESCC cells; in other words, EIF3E could facilitate malignant behavior
  of ESCC cells.
