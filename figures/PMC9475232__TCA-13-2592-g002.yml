caption: 'Fibulin‐4 promotes proliferation and migration in esophageal squamous cell
  carcinoma (ESCC) cells. (a) Fibulin‐4 expression in the KYSE30, KYSE510, Eca109,
  and KYSE150 cell lines was detected by qRT–PCR. (b) Transfection efficiency of the
  fibulin‐4 silencing lentivirus or overexpression lentivirus was detected by western
  blot. (c) Eca109 and KYSE30 cells treated or left untreated were seeded at 5000
  cells/well (96‐well plate). OD values were measured after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Proliferation
  was calculated as OD (24, 48, 72 and 96 h)/OD (24 h). (d) Eca109 and KYSE30 cells
  treated or left untreated were seeded at 5000 cells/well (96‐well plate). Cells
  were later marked by EdU, immobilized, Apollo stained, and stained with DNA. Images
  were acquired under an inverted fluorescence microscope. (e) Cells were cultured
  in FBS‐free medium for 24 h after the “wound” was made, and images were acquired
  with an optical microscope. (f) The migration rate of the cells was calculated from
  three independent experiments. The error bars indicate the means ± SD averaged from
  three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
  NC: Negative control of silencing lentiviral vector; vector: Negative control of
  overexpression lentiviral vector.'
