caption: The effects and putative mechanisms of the involvement of IL-33 in neutrophils
  and T helper cells in COVID-19. In response to SAS-CoV-2, IL-33 is released as an
  alarmin from epithelial cells due to disruption of the epithelial barrier and cell
  damage. This promotes rapid neutrophil infiltration, migration, and activation via
  macrophage-derived CXCL1 and CXCL2 while inducing massive accumulation of ROS via
  the IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway, which in turn induces the excessive release of
  NETs. Additionally, IL-33 dose dependently upregulates MHC-II class and co-stimulatory
  molecules to induce maturation and activation of immature DCs and then stimulates
  activation of CD4+ T cells and induces their differentiation to Th17 cells instead
  of Treg cells through secretion of IL-1Î² and IL-6. Finally, a large number of NETs
  and inflammatory cells enter the bloodstream, triggering serious complications,
  such as vasoembolic conditions and inflammatory reactions.
