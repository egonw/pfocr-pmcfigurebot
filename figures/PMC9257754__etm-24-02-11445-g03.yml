caption: Ratio of mononuclear lymphocytes with positive expression of IL-10. (A) Flow
  cytometric analysis of IL-10+ mononuclear lymphocytes. (B) Ratio of IL-10+ mononuclear
  lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were isolated from healthy normal subjects and patients
  with IPF. Flow cytometry was used to detect IL-10+ mononuclear lymphocytes. *P<0.05
  compared with normal subjects. IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
