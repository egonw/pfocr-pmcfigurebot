caption: 'Direct effects of ASCs on the expression of Th subset-specific transcription
  factors in activated T cells. T helper (CD3+CD4+) lymphocytes (T) were isolated
  from peripheral blood of 22 healthy volunteers, activated via CD3/CD28 pathway,
  and co-cultured for 5 days with either untreated or TNF + IFNγ (TI) pre-stimulated
  ASCs lines from healthy donors (HD/ASCs, A,D), SLE (SLE/ASCs, B,E), or SSc (SSc/ASCs,
  C,F) patients. The co-cultures were done using a random combination of both cell
  types, and the number of experiments performed is shown (n). The levels of expression
  of mRNAs encoding transcription factors specific for Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subsets
  (T-bet, GATA3, RORc, and FoxP3, respectively) were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR,
  as described in the Materials and methods. Results are expressed as the percentage
  of the mRNAs expression levels regarding those found in separately cultured control
  activated T cells and are shown as the Tukey’s boxes with the median (horizontal
  line), interquartile range (IQR, box), lower and upper whiskers (data within 3/2xIQR),
  and outliers (points/dots). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures
  and post-hoc Tukey test was used to evaluate the effect of ASCs (T vs. T + ASCs
  or ASCsTI; * p = 0.05–0.01; ** p = 0.01–0.001; *** p = 0.001–0.0001). The inter-group
  (HD vs. SLE vs. SSc) comparison was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s
  multiple comparison test (# p = 0.05–0.01; ## p = 0.01–0.001; ### p = 0.001–0.0001
  for the groups of patients vs. HD comparison).'
