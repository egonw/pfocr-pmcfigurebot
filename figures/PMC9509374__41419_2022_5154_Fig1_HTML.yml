figure_title: HM13 is up-regulated in breast cancer
caption: A, B The expression of HM13 according to TCGA based on sample types (A) or
  subclasses (B) in breast cancer. Transcriptome profiling was obtained from TCGA.
  Based on PAM50 signature, we processed the data and showed the expression level
  of HM13 in breast cancer subclasses. P-values smaller than 0.05. C, D The correlation
  between HM13 expression and prognosis of the breast cancer patients was presented
  by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. E, F qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression
  levels of HM13 in breast cancer tissues (E) and cell lines (F), respectively. G,
  H Protein expression of HM13 in pairs of tissues (G) and cell lines (H) of breast
  cancer. Data were shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: Histocompatibility Minor 13 (HM13), targeted by miR-760, exerts oncogenic
  role in breast cancer by suppressing autophagy and activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
