caption: Signaling pathway proteins, transcription factor, and miR cross-connecting
  paths/links to metabolic enzymes in cervical cancer. Six metabolic enzymes (Aâ€“F)
  are commonly linked to signaling proteins, transcription factors, and miR. Two metabolic
  enzymes, EZH2 and AKR1C2 (B,D), are connected to deregulated metabolites in cervical
  cancer. Terminal signaling pathway proteins, transcription factors, and miRNAs,
  metabolic enzymes are colored in purple, green, red, and blue. Protein-protein interactors
  are colored in orange. Gene regulatory edges are represented as black arrows and
  protein-protein interactions are represented by orange edges. Nodes with an asterisk
  (*) are key or effector nodes in the significant paths/network.
