caption: Construction of gene signature and characteristics of the two-gene signature
  in TCGA STAD dataset. (a) and (b) Univariance and multivariance Cox regression to
  identify immune-gene signature. (c) Heatmap demonstrating the distribution of the
  two immune-related gene expression in the TCGA cohort. (d) and (e) Distribution
  of risk score and patient survival time, the black dotted line is the optimal cut-of
  value for dividing patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. (f) Kaplan-Meier
  survival curves of the two gene signature of patients with STAD in the TCGA cohort.
  (g) Heatmap of the immune-gene signature with other clinical parameters.
