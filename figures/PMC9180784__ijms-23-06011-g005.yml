caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DAMs and DEGs in different combinations
  of Benzoic acid vs. Chlorine dioxide (A), Benzoic acid vs. 1-MCP (B), Benzoic acid
  vs. Control (C), Chlorine dioxide vs. Control (D), 1-MCP vs. Chlorine dioxide (E),
  1-MCP vs. Control (F). The x-axis is the enrichment pathway, while red and green
  on the y-axis are the p-values of DAMs and DEGs, respectively.
