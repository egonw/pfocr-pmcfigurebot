caption: CD44 promotes the proliferation of osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. (A)
  Protein expression levels after CD44 overexpression and knockdown in U-2 OS and
  MG-63 cells respectively. (B) The mRNA expression levels after CD44 overexpression
  and knockdown in U-2 OS and MG-63 cells respectively. (C) CD44 affects cell clone
  formation ability in U-2 OS and MG-63 cells. (D) The effect of CD44 on the growth
  of U-2 OS and MG-63 cells was examined by CCK 8 at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. €
  Subcutaneous tumor formation after CD44-overexpression and Vector. (E) Xenograft
  tumors in nude mice. (F) Tumor growth curves and tumor weights were shown for CD44-overexpression
  and Vector groups. The CCK-8 indicates Cell Counting Kit-8. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
article_title: CD44 expression is correlated with osteosarcoma cell progression and
  immune infiltration and affects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
