caption: RFX1 negatively correlates with metastatic lung cancer. (A) Kaplan-Meier
  survival analysis based on data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
  (SEER) database to investigate median survival time of patients with HCC with or
  without lung metastasis. (B) Data analysis of RFX1 expression in patients with and
  without metastatic lung cancer from TCGE database. (C) and (D) PCA analysis of the
  correlation between RFX1 (C) and ACTA2 (D) expression and tumor signature score.
  (E) Proposed mechanism of H-TDE-induced lung PMN formation.
