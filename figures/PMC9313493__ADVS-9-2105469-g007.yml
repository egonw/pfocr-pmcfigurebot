caption: 'AZD1775‐triggered UPR was induced via NF‐κB‐dependent SASP in mtTP53 ovarian
  cancer cells. A) Intracellular soluble protein assay of OVCAR8, A2780, and ID8 cells
  treated with DMSO or 400 × 10−9m AZD1775. B,C) Levels of two recognized SASP factors
  IL‐8, IL‐6 were measured by ELISA assay following 72 h treatment with DMSO or 400 ×
  10−9m AZD1775. Error bars represent the SD of the mean (n = 3). *p < 0.05, ***p
  < 0.001, ns, not significant, as determined by the unpaired two‐tailed Student''s
  t‐test. D) GSEA plot of the Hallmark pathway TNF‐α Signaling Via NF‐κB enriched
  by GSEA in OVCAR8 cells treated with 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 48 h. E) Western blot
  analysis of the protein expression levels of P50, P65, p‐P65 in NF‐κB pathway. OVCAR8
  cells were treated with DMSO or 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 or transfected with scramble
  siRNA (si‐NC) or two WEE1 siRNAs for 24 h. F) Western blot analysis of the protein
  expression levels of P65, p‐P65. mtTP53 cells OVCAR8 and HOC7, and TP53 wild type
  cells A2780 were treated with or without 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 24 h. G) Western
  blot analysis of P65 and p‐P65 in A2780 cells treated with or without 400 × 10−9m
  AZD1775 for 24 h after transfected with scramble siRNA (NC) or TP53 siRNA. #2 and
  #3 denote deferent TP53 siRNAs. H) Levels of IL‐6 and IL‐8 in cell culture supernatant
  were measured by ELISA assay. OVCAR8 cells were transfected with or without P65
  siRNA#3 (si‐P65) verified in Figure  (Supporting Information) and treated with or
  without 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 24 h. Error bars represent the SD of the mean (n
  = 3), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, as determined by ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.
  I) The level of key proteins in the UPR was determined by Western analysis. OVCAR8
  and HOC7 cells were treated the same as in (H) and harvested after 72 h cultivation.
  J) Representative images of aggregated proteins. OVCAR8 cells with scramble‐ko or
  P65‐knockout (p65 ko) were treated with DMSO or 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for 48 h and
  protein aggregates were detected using the Proteostat Dye. Scale bar, 20 µm. K)
  The quantification of aggregated proteins shown in (J). Error bars represent the
  SD of the mean (n = 3), ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant, as determined by ANOVA
  with Bonferroni post hoc test. L) Expression profile of cytokines in culture supernatant
  was determined by chemiluminescence using a Human XL Cytokine Array (see method
  for details). OVCAR8 cells with scramble‐ko or IRE1‐knockout (IRE1 ko) were cultured
  in medium containing 2% serum and treated with or without 400 × 10−9m AZD1775 for
  48 h.'
