caption: Overexpression of TP53INP2 inhibits tumor growth in mice. (a) and (b) Tumorous
  size was determined every three days. TP53INP2- or empty vector-transfected ACHN
  cells were injected into mice (n = 6). (c) and (d) The levels of autophagy-related
  and proapoptotic protein in tumor tissue were determined by a way of western blot.
  (e) Representative H&E staining images of tumor tissue (400x). TP53INP2 expression
  was detected with immunohistochemistry (400x). TUNEL was used to detect apoptosis
  in tumor tissues (400x). ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
