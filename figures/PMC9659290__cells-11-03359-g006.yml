caption: 'Differentially expressed genes of the signaling pathway of innate immunity
  and anti−viral factors in CD8+ T lymphocytes in severe COVID-19. (A) Expression
  of antiviral factors by PCR array of 84 genes of CD8+ T lymphocytes from individuals
  with severe COVID-19 compared to uninfected. The red dots represent the upregulated
  genes in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the green dot represents the downregulated
  gene, and black dots represent genes that do not change. (B) Heatmap of expression
  of antiviral factors of CD8+ T lymphocytes from uninfected (n = 6) and infected
  individuals with severe COVID-19. Genes are divided into groups according to the
  associated signaling pathway: Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD −like receptor (NLR),
  and RIG−like receptor (RLR).'
