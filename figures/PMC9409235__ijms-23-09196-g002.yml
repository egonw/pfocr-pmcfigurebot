caption: mTOR affects NAFLD through lipid metabolism (SREBPs), insulin resistance
  (Lipin1, Foxo1), and oxidative stress (PIG3, p53, JNK). (a). Excessive amounts of
  triglycerides stored in fat enter the liver as FFAs. Excessive triglyceride levels
  activate the feedback regulation of mTORC1 to block FFA-induced mitochondrial OS
  and the PIG3-p53-JNK-OS recycling pathway in the liver. mTORC1 can also regulate
  the effects of OS, mediated by NF-ÎºB and PTEN. (b). FFAs activate Lipin1 and Foxo1
  through mTORC1, thereby affecting DAG and PKC levels to influence hepatic IR. (c).
  mTORC1 can regulate SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 levels after activation by CRTC2 and can
  phosphorylate Lipin1, which affects insulin levels. Furthermore, mTORC1 can indirectly
  affect DNL-related gene levels by directly regulating the nSREBP gene via Akt. mTORC1
  also directly suppresses DNL-related genes and thus exhibits feedback regulation
  of triglyceride synthesis. mTOR can affect triglyceride synthesis, liver lipid accumulation,
  liver gluconeogenesis, hepatitis, and fibrosis via the above three processes in
  NAFLD.
