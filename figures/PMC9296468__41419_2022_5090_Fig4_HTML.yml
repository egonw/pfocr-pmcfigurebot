caption: 'A Statistical distribution chart of differentially expressed glycoproteins
  under each GO category (2nd Level). The X-axis label is divided into three parts:
  biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. B KEGG pathway enrichment
  bubble plot of differentially expressed glycoproteins (left panel). The size and
  color of the bubbles reflect the glycoprotein counts and p value, respectively.
  Heatmap of the PI3K-AKT pathway-related glycoprotein expression (right panel).'
