caption: 'The verification of differentially expressed genes of enrichment pathways
  in the rumen and jejunum. A: The differentially expressed genes of 4 enrichment
  pathways related to immunology and inflammation in rumen samples. The purple represents
  the NF-Kappa B signaling pathway. The green represents the IL-17 signaling pathway.
  The red represents the chemokine signaling pathway. The blue represents the cytokine–cytokine
  signaling pathway. B: The differentially expressed genes of 4 enrichment pathways
  related to immunology and energy metabolism in jejunum samples. The purple represents
  the fat digestion and absorption signaling pathway. The green represents the synthesis
  and degradation of ketone bodies signaling pathway. The red represents the intestinal
  immune network for IgA production signaling pathway. The blue represents the nitrogen
  metabolism signaling pathway. C: The qPCR results of differentially expressed genes
  in the rumen. D: The qPCR results of differentially expressed genes in the jejunum.
  The x axis shows the fold change of genes (SB vs Ctrl). The y axis shows the significant
  genes of the top 4 enrichment pathways (A and B). ∗P < 0.05.'
