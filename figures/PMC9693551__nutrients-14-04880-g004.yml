caption: The inhibition of the invasion process of SW480 (A) and HT-29 (B) cell lines.
  The percentage of relative fluorescence units (RFU) is proportional to the number
  of invasive cells. FBS 10% was used as a chemoattractant control and treatment exposure
  was 24 h. Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  Two-way ANOVA, the difference to non-treated cells, * p ≤ 0.05 and ** p ≤ 0.01.
