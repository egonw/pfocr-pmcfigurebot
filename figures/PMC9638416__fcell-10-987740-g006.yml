caption: Sub-group gene expression and signalling pathway analysis on male and female
  placentas. (A). PCA plots showing separation of term and preterm samples in male
  and female placenta. (B). Venn diagram showing DEGs in male and female preterm placenta
  and common DEGs among both sexes. (C,D). Volcano plots showing DEGs in male (C)
  and female (D) preterm placentas. Horizontal and vertical dotted lines indicate
  thresholds Padj < 0.05 and Log2FC = +/−1. (E–H). GO and KEGG signalling pathways
  for male (E, F respectively) and female (G, H respectively) preterm placentas. n
  = 16 males and 12 females (1:1 term vs. preterm).
