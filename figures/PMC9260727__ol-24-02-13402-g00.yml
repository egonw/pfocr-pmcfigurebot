caption: MOSPD1 is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer.
  (A) Suppressed expression of MOSPD1 by β-catenin siRNAs in SW480 and HCT116 cells.
  (B) Induction of β-catenin in HeLa cells treated with LiCl (30 and 100 mM) increased
  MOSPD1 expression. The expression of β-actin served as a loading control. (C) Expression
  of MOSPD1 in 104 CRC tissues and 25 non-tumorous colonic tissues. The data were
  obtained from a dataset of GSE21510 in GEO. Statistical significance was determined
  by unpaired t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. (D) The Pearson's correlation
  coefficient (r) between the expression values of MOSPD1 and three Wnt target genes
  was calculated to assess their correlation. The solid line indicates linear fit.
  The data were obtained from GSE21510. (E) Immunohistochemical staining of β-catenin
  (upper) and MOSPD1 (lower) in CRC tissues. Scale bars 200 µm. MOSPD1, motile sperm
  domain containing 1; LiCl, lithium chloride; CRC, colorectal cancer; GEO, Gene Expression
  Omnibus.
