caption: 'Orcinol glucoside (OG) attenuates bone loss in SAMP6 mice. (a) Representative
  3D micro-CT images of the distal femoral trabecular bone microarchitecture; (b)
  bone mineral density (BMD); (c) bone surface to bone volume (BS/BV); (d) bone surface
  to tissue volume (BS/TV); (e) bone volume to tissue volume (BV/TV); (f) trabecular
  thickness (Tb. Th); (g) trabecular separation (Tb. Sp); (h) trabecular number (Tb.
  N); (i) structure model index (SMI); (j) connectivity density; (k) serum CTX-1 levels
  were determined by ELISA; (l, m) urine Ca2+ and DPD levels were measured by biochemical
  kits. CON: control group, SAMR1 mice treated with 0.5%CMC-Na; MOD: model group,
  SAMP6 mice treated with 0.5%CMC-Na; NAC: SAMP6 mice treated with NAC (100 mg/kg);
  OG-50: SAMP6 mice treated with OG (50 mg/kg); OG-100: SAMP6 mice treated with OG
  (100 mg/kg). The data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 8‐9). #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01
  vs. control group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. model group.'
