caption: 'The effect of AS on the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway related proteins
  expression in LPS-induced ARDS mice. Western blot was used to detect the relative
  protein expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-18, and IL-1β in the lung tissue
  of each group of mice, β-actin was used as the internal control. ▲▲P < 0.01 vs.
  Control group. ★P < 0.05 vs. LPS group. AS: artesunate. LPS : Lipopolysaccharide.'
