caption: 'The ROS–mediated signaling pathway involved in the ILL–induced autophagy
  and apoptosis of CRC cells. (A) Cells were treated with 40 μM of ILL for the indicated
  time points and the levels of p–ERK, ERK, p–JNK, JNK, p–p38, and p38 were determined
  by Western blot. (B) Cells were pretreated with 20 μM of ERK inhibitor (U0126),
  2.5 μM of JNK inhibitor (SP600125), or 20 μM of p38 inhibitor (SB203580) for 2 h,
  followed by treatment with 40 μM of ILL for 24 h. They were then subjected to an
  MTT assay for cell viability analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from
  three different experiments. * p < 0.05 versus control, ns: not significant. (C)
  Cells were pretreated with 3 mM of NAC or 20 μM of ERK inhibitor (U0126) for 2 h,
  followed by treatment with 40 μM of ILL for 24 h. The levels of p–ERK, ERK, LC3B–I,
  LC3B–II, and cleaved caspase–9 and –3 were analyzed by Western blot. (D) Cells were
  pretreated with 3 mM of NAC or 20 Μm of ERK inhibitor (U0126) for 2 h, followed
  by treatment with 40 μM of ILL for 24 h. Cells were then subjected to MDC staining
  and the images were captured by fluorescence microscope.'
