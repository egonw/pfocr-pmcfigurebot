caption: Representation of the steps in the lipogenesis cycle, cholesterol and glutamine
  regulated by ncRNAs in reprogramed BC. ncRNAs can modulate the molecules of lipids
  and cholesterol by regulating of the expression ACLY, ACC, HMGCS, HMGCR and SQLE
  enzymes. Moreover, ncRNAs induced their regulatory role on the conversation of glutamine
  to glutamate pathway via downregulation of glutaminases enzyme. The enzymes that
  are downregulated by ncRNAs are shown by the red arrow, whereas the upregulation
  effect of ncRNAs is illustrated by the green arrow. ACLY, ATP citrate lyase; ACC,
  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FASN, Fatty Acid Synthase; HMGCS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase; HMGCR, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase; SQLE, Squalene Epoxidase.
