figure_title: LSECtin induced FN1 and CHD4 expression through STAT1 transcriptional
  regulation
caption: A The 3D profile according to the fold-change values of differentially expressed
  genes. B KEGG pathway analysis of common terms revealed enrichment of genes related
  to various events. C, D Differential expression of FN1 and CHD4 in GC cells treated
  with 1 μg/ml LSECtin protein (12 h, 18 h, and 24 h) were detected by Western blot
  (C) and qPCR (D), with controls treated with isotype IgG for 24 h. E Survival analysis
  of GC patients based on FN1 and CHD4 expression were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier plotter
  database. F FN1 and CHD4 expression levels in 415 samples of gasric cancer and 35
  samples of normal tissue, FN1 and CHD4 expression levels in 32 tumor and matched
  normal samples from GC patients, G Venn diagram showing the transcription factors
  that coregulated FN1 and CHD4 identified in two databases. H, I The expression of
  FN1 and CHD4 in GC cells after STAT1 knockdown, or overexpression were analyzed
  by qPCR (H) and Western blot analysis (I). J Schematic representation of the STAT1-binding
  site in the FN1 and CHD4 promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
  confirming FN1 and CHD4 promoter region enrichment with and anti-STAT1 antibody.
  K Western blot analysis of FN1 and CHD4 expression after the knockdown or overexpression
  of STAT1 in BGC-823 cells and LSECtin-induced. Error bars indicate standard deviation
  (n = 3). Data, the means ± SD.
