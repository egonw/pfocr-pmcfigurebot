caption: Multi-omics characteristic landscapes of 26 m6A regulators and relevant biological
  pathway of m6A modification pattern in HCC. (A) The intra-clusters similarities
  of 26 m6A regulators were visualized by the metascape enrichment network, and the
  cluster annotations were presented with color code, including methylation, stability,
  and C complex spliceosome. (B) Genetic mutations landscape of 26 m6A regulators
  was found in 35of the 361 HCC patients, with a frequency of 9.7%, and the mutation
  frequency of each regulator were shown on the right. (C) The bar plot indicated
  the CNV alterations frequency of regulators in the TCGA-LIHC cohort. The amplification
  frequency was presented in pink dot, and the deletion frequency was in green dot.
  (D) The transcriptome landscape of regulators between normal and HCC samples in
  TCGA-LIHC cohort. The statistical p-value was showed by the asterisks above (ns,
  p > 0.05; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). (E) The interaction of expression
  on 24 m6A regulators were sequenced in both TCGA and GSE76427 HCC cohorts. The 24
  m6A regulators were depicted into three RNA modification types by the left half
  of circle in different colors. Erasers, red, Readers, yellow; Writers, blue; and
  the lines connecting each m6A regulator represented their interaction with each
  other. The size of each circle was referring to the overall survival (OS) pâ€“value.
  The green dot on the right half of circle indicated favorable factors for HCC prognosis,
  while the purple dot represented risk factors. (F) Kaplan-Meier curves of overall
  survival (OS) for merged HCC cohorts (TCGA-LIHC and GSE76427 cohorts) among three
  distinct m6A clusters. The numbers of patients in m6Aclusters A, B and C phenotypes
  are 159, 151, and 175, respectively (Log-rank test, p < 0.05). (G) Heatmap indicated
  the significant KEGG pathways curated from MSigDB in m6Acluster A vs. m6Acluster
  B.
