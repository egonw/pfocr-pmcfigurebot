caption: Inhibition of in vivo tumor growth by Chloroxylon swietenia leaves methanol
  extract (CSLME) in NOD‐SCID mice model (A) Line graph representing the tumor volumes
  in control and CSLME (20 mg/kg body weight) treated NOD‐SCID mice during the course
  of in vivo experiment. (B) Average body weights of the NOD‐SCID mice after administration
  of either PBS or CSLME. The results summarized are the mean values of n = 6 ± SD;
  **p < .05 versus control
