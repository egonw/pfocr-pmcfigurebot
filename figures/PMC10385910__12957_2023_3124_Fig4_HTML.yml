caption: TRIM58 interacted with RECQL4 and enhanced its ubiquitination in CRC cells.
  A The relative mRNA levels of RECQL4 in SW620 cells transduced with RECQL4 expression
  vector. B The protein levels of RECQL4 in SW620 cells transduced with RECQL4 expression
  vector and treated with MG132. C Co-IP assay shows that TRIM58 interacted with RECQL4
  in SW620 cells. D Ubiquitination assay was performed to examine the ubiquitination
  of RECQL4 in LOVO cells transduced with TRIM58 shRNA and SW620 cells transduced
  with TRIM58 expression vector. E Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to
  examine the protein expression of TRIM58 and RECQL4 in CRC and paracancerous tissues
  (scale bar, 100 Î¼m)
article_title: TRIM58 functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by promoting
  RECQL4 ubiquitination to inhibit the AKT signaling pathway.
