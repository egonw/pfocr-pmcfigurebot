caption: 'Study the effect of miR30d-5p mimic to the phenotype of PEO1 and A2780 cells.
  (A) Proliferation rate of cell cultures that were transfected with 25 nM, 50 nM,
  or 100 nM miR-30d-5p mimic. Cell proliferation was determined 24 h after transfection
  relative to the non-treated control (1). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. a:
  p < 0.05; b: p < 0.01. (B) Log2FC values of selected genes in response to transfection
  by 50 nM and 100 nM miR-30d-5p mimic. Total RNA was isolated from the cells 24 h
  after transfection. Significance was determined between the ∆CT values of the treated
  and non-treated samples. a: p < 0.05.'
