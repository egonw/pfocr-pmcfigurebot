caption: 'Structure and synthesis of G4HisMal. (A) Simplified structure of G4HisMal.
  Layers 1–4 indicate dendrimer’s branching points and generation of the dendrimer.
  Layer 4 shows N terminal groups with maltose as R1 and histidine as R2 substituents.
  (B) Distance distribution functions P(R) of G4HisMal in PBS calculated SAXS pattern
  of G4HisMal in PBS at 37 °C using GNOM.40 Insertion: De novo three-dimensional reconstruction
  of the scattering entity of G4HisMal using DAMMIF after 10 independent reconstructions.
  A line indicates the maximum dimension (Dmax). UCSF Chimera41 was used for visualization.
