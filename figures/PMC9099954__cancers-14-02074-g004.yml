caption: GATA5 mediates EMT via the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway. (A) The result of enrichment
  of the KEGG pathway demonstrated that GATA5 was involved in PCa progression through
  the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway. (B) The p-FAK expression and the downstream signaling
  pathway proteins, p-PI3K and p-AKT, were assessed by Western blotting analysis.
  (C) Overexpression of GATA5 inhibited the process of EMT, which was verified by
  the Western blotting. (D) Immunofluorescence verified the Western blotting results.
