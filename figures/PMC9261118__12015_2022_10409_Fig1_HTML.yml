caption: Mechanism of action of the monoclonal antibody anti-IL-6R (Tocilizumab) and
  the mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes carrying microRNAs (miRNAs). The neutralizing
  antibody Tocilizumab attach and inhibit the activation of the signaling pathway
  started by the IL-6 reducing the patient inflammatory state. Due to their nanosized
  diameter, the exosomes can cross the central nervous system natural barriers (BBB
  and CSF) and release the small and non-coding miRNAs inside the target cell cytoplasm.
  The miRNAs perform a post-transcriptional activity by binding to the IL-6 complex
  mRNAs (IL6, IL6R and IL6ST) through perfect and imperfect base pairing stopping
  protein translation and attenuate the inflammation and consequently blood coagulation
  inside microvasculation of the CNS
