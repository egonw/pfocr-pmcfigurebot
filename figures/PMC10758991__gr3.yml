caption: Activation of NLRP3 signalling exacerbates periodontal tissue damage due
  to impairment of macrophage function(A and B) GO enrichment analysis of DEGs in
  the gingiva in the healthy group compared to the periodontitis group; the number
  of DEGs in the enriched terms is indicated by the dot size. The color scale indicates
  the significance of the enrichment of each term.(C) GSEA of upregulated genes associated
  with pattern recognition receptor signaling and cytokine secretion.(D) Identification
  of genes associated with the terms pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway,
  response to molecules of bacterial origin, and macrophage cytokine production.(E)
  Histogram showing the expression of Nlrp3, Irak3, Tlr2, and Ticam1 in each group.(F
  and G) Representative IF images and counts of F4/80+ and cl-caspase-1+ cells in
  the gingiva in each group. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Scale bar, 50 μm.(H) GSEA
  comparing the activity of the selected pathways between the periodontitis group
  and the healthy group.(I) Flow cytometry plots of BMDMs that engulfed beads, along
  with the percentage of phagocytic cells in each group.The data are representative
  of 3 biological replicates (A–E) or are displayed as the means ± SEMs of 6 samples
  (G and I) per group. Student’s t test; ∗p < 0.05.
