caption: 'Effect of miR-372-3p KD on cardiac dysfunction. (a) Representative echocardiography
  in the control, model, and miR-372-3p KD groups. (b) Statistical analysis for LVFS,
  LVEF, and HW/BW ratio in the control, model, and miR-372-3p KD group. (c) RT-qPCR
  analysis of relative expression of miR-372-3p. n = 7/group, ∗∗P < 0.05: model group
  vs. miR-372-3p KD group. HW/BW: heart weight/body weight.'
