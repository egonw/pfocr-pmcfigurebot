caption: LIS1 promotes the migration and invasion of SACC-LM cells. (A) Wound healing
  assays were used to test the horizontal migration ability of SACC-LM cells with
  overexpressed (12 h after scratching) or knocked down (24 h after scratching) LIS1
  expression. Scale bar, 500 µm. (B and C) The wound closure area of cells following
  (B) LIS1 overexpression and (C) LIS1 knockdown was quantitatively analyzed. (D)
  The effect of LIS1 overexpression and knockdown on chemotactic migration and invasion
  of SACC-LM cells was assessed using Transwell chambers. For migration, cells were
  seeded in the upper chambers for 12 h. For invasion, cells were seeded in the upper
  chambers coated with Matrigel for 24 h. Scale bar, 100 µm. (E and F) Quantitative
  statistical analysis of the number of penetrated cells after (E) 12 h of migration
  and (F) 24 h of invasion. (G) IF double staining of cortactin and F-actin was performed
  to detect invadopodia in SACC-LM cells after transfection with the LIS1 plasmid
  or si-LIS1. F-actin was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568, cortactin was conjugated
  with Alexa Fluor 488, and the merged images (yellow) show colocalization of F-actin
  (red) and cortactin (green) indicating invadopodia formation. Scale bar, 25 µm.
  (H) Quantitative data of the area of invadopodia per cell determined by colocalization
  of cortactin and F-actin. (I) MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 protein expression in SACC-LM
  cells with overexpressed or knocked down LIS1 expression was assessed via western
  blotting. (J) Quantitative analysis of MMP protein expression. Mean ± SEM; *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. LIS1, lissencephaly 1; SACC, salivary gland adenoid cystic
  carcinoma; si-, small interfering RNA; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
