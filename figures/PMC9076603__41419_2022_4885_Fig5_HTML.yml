figure_title: DENND2D suppressed CRC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro by
  MAPK pathway
caption: A Differential pathway-related protein expression between shNC and sh2 DENND2D
  cell lines. B The relationship between six key molecules using Pearson correlation
  analysis of the data from the TCGA database. C DENND2D overexpression or knockdown
  changed the levels of p-MET1/2 (Ser221) and p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) in HCT116 cells,
  as determined by WB assay. D, E DENND2D and pERK were expressed in xenografts generated
  from HCT116-sh1/sh2, HCT-shNC, HCT116, and DENND2D-overexpressing cells. Fâ€“H Restoring
  DENND2D expression in DENND2D-silenced CRC cells rescued the activity of the MAPK
  pathway.
article_title: Stage IV colon cancer patients without DENND2D expression benefit more
  from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
