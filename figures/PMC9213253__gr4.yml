caption: Relative contribution of the different ADP1 enzymes to the alternative β-alanine
  biosynthesis pathway.A, comparison of wildtype and ΔpanD growth. B, growth of single-deletion
  mutants of candidate genes involved in the alternative pathway. C, growth of Δddc
  complemented with DAP (1 mM) or β-alanine (10 μM). D, growth of the ΔpanD strain
  additionally deleted for the various candidate genes. E, growth of the double mutants
  complemented with β-alanine. F, comparison of DAP content in Δddc and WT strains.
  Independent overnight cultures were grown in minimal medium for Acinetobacter (MA)
  supplemented with 1 mM DAP and 10 μM β-alanine, harvested, and washed before inoculation
  in MA minimal medium. Absorbance at 600 nm was recorded by an automated growth curve
  analysis system (Bioscreen-C; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Values correspond to the
  average of three replicates. Colors indicate the gene(s) deleted in each strain.
  LC/MS/MS data for DAP correspond to six independent metabolite extractions for each
  strain. Indicated values in F correspond to automatic peak integration for the mass
  transition m/z 283.1 → 104.9. Values of DAP in Δddc were below the detection limit
  (). ADP1, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1; DAP, 1,3-diaminopropane.
