figure_title: EZH2 inhibition by zld1039 blocked NF-κB signaling activation in cisplatin-induced
  AKI mice
caption: 'a–e Protein expression levels of p65, IκBα and p-p65, p-IκBα, were quantified
  by densitometry and normalized with GAPDH; f The mRNA level of p65 (n = 6); ****P < 0.0001,
  ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05. g Control and cisplatin treated mice kidney
  tissues were subjected to ChIP assays using immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the H3K27me3
  antibody. The amounts of precipitated p65 (Rlea) DNA were quantified by qPCR using
  primers amplifying the regions indicated in Table S. The data are presented as mean ± SD
  (n = 3). ####P < 0.0001 compared with the control group IgG. **P < 0.01 compared
  with the cisplatin group IgG antibody. △P < 0.05 compared with the control group
  H3K27me3 antibody. All Western blot analyses were performed in two randomized mice
  from each group, and the experiments were repeated in triplicate.'
