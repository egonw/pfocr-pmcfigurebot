caption: 'AKIP1 participates in the angiogenesis in ccRCC by binding to Rac1. (A)
  The angiogenesis in CM from Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1 and Ov-Rac1
  was detected by HUVEC tube-formation assay. The (B) mRNA and (C) protein expression
  of angiogenesis-related proteins in CM from Caki-1 cells transfected with siRNA-AKIP1
  and Ov-Rac1 were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western
  blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. control (CM)+ HUVEC group; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs.
  siRNA-AKIP1 (CM)+HUVEC group; ++P<0.01 and +++P<0.001 vs. siRNA-AKIP1+Ov-NC (CM)+HUVEC
  group. CM, culture media; ccRCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma; AKIP1, a-kinase
  interaction protein 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; Ov, overexpression.'
article_title: A-kinase interacting protein 1 regulates the cell proliferation, invasion,
  migration and angiogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells and affects
  the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.
