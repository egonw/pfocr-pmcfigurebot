caption: Anti-tumor effects of ZWB90-3 in the A549 NSCLC xenograft mouse model. (A)
  Drug administration scheme. (B) Mice were intravenously injected with 10 mg/kg and
  25 mg/kg doses of ZWB90-3, and the two control groups were treated with PBS or 30
  mg/kg of Emi-IgG4. A total of seven mice per group was used for the study. * p <
  0.05 was considered significant as compared to the vehicle control. (C) Mice body
  weight curve. (D) Tumor tissues were dissected and photographed. (E) Tumors were
  weighed and the tumor-to-body weight ratio was calculated. * p < 0.05 was considered
  significant as compared to the vehicle control. ** p < 0.01 was considered significant
  as compared to Emi-IgG4 group.
