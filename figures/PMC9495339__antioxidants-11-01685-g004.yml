caption: Nrf2/HO−1 pathway and TLRs/NF-κB pathway. In canonical TLRs/NF-κB signaling,
  TLRs activate TAK1-TAB1 kinase complex, resulting in IKK complex-meditated release
  of NF-κB dimers and phosphorylation of IκB. Phosphorylated IκB frees NF-κB dimers
  and permits NF-κB dimers translocated into the nucleus. However, activation of Nrf2
  can inhibit IκB phosphorylation in the canonical NF-κB pathway, thereby reducing
  the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB dimers and inhibiting its downstream immune response
  genes expression, such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, and COX-2. Moreover, elevated
  expression of HO−1 mediated by Nrf2 also demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory
  and inhibition of apoptosis effects in the progression of PF.
