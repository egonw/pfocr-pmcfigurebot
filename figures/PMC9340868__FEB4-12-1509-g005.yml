caption: Etoposide modulates phosphorylation levels of the mTOR pathway, and rapamycin
  modulates the expression of metabolic genes. (A) Western blot analysis of total
  Ramos cell proteins treated with 20 µm etoposide for periods of 10 min to 3 h, using
  specific antibodies to evaluate mTOR pathway. (B) Densitometry quantitation analysis
  of western blot assay, for each case the result was expressed as the ratio of phosphor‐protein
  levels with respect to total protein. Data are presented as mean ± SE (C) Ramos
  cell line was treated with 50 nm rapamycin for 1 and 3 h. Immunoblot analysis was
  performed using specific antibodies to evaluate mTOR pathway. For qPCR assay, the
  cells were treated with 50 nm rapamycin for 3 h. (D) Effect on glycolytic gene expression.
  (E) Pentose phosphate pathways genes. (F) Lipid and cholesterol synthesis genes.
  (G) Mitochondrial genes. 36B4 was used as a housekeeping gene, and DMSO was used
  as vehicle. Error bars indicate SD, P‐values determined by Mann–Whitney test (nonparametric
  t‐test). **P < 0.001; *P < 0.01. The results are representative of three independent
  experiments.
