caption: BMP2 promotes LSCC VM and metastasis by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway.
  A KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. B Western blot analysis
  of p-PTEN, p-PDK, p-Akt, and Akt in LSCC. C Overexpression efficiency of BMP2 was
  verified using qRT-PCR. D, F–H Transwell migration, Transwell invasion, and scratch
  wound-healing assays were performed in three groups (DMSO, BMP2 + DMSO, and BMP2 + MK2206),
  respectively. E, I, J Tubule formation and spheroid invasion assays were conducted
  in the same three groups. K, L Western blot analysis of BMP2, p-PTEN, p-PDK, p-Akt,
  and Akt in the three groups in TU212 and TU686 cells. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001,
  Student’s t-test and two-way ANOVA

  carcinoma via activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
