caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the host genes of all DE RNAs. (A) GO
  enrichment analysis of the host genes of all DE ncRNAs. The horizontal coordinate
  is the GO classification, the left side of the vertical coordinate is the percentage
  of the number of genes enriched in that GO term, and the right side is the number
  of genes. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of the host genes of all DE ncRNAs. Each
  circle in  represents a KEGG pathway, the vertical coordinate indicates the top
  20 pathway names, and the horizontal coordinate is the enrichment factor, which
  represents the ratio of the proportion of differential genes annotated to a pathway
  (gene ratio) to the proportion of all genes annotated to that pathway (background
  ratio). The colour of the circle represents the q value, which is the P value after
  correction for multiple hypothesis testing, and the size of the circle indicates
  the number of genes enriched in the pathway.
