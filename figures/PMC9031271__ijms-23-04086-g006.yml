caption: '(A)—Gene expression of TGF-β signaling pathway molecules in ASMC after incubation
  with allergen-activated eosinophils; (B)—Gene expression of TGF-β signaling pathway
  molecules in PFafter incubation with allergen-activated eosinophils. AA, n = 4,
  SNEA, n = 4, HS, n = 4. Data are presented as fold change over the non-activated
  AA eosinophil effect, mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05 compared with non-activated eosinophil
  effect. Statistical analysis between investigated groups—Wilcoxon signed-rank test
  was used for gene expression analysis against control ASMC or PF that were not incubated
  with eosinophils.'
