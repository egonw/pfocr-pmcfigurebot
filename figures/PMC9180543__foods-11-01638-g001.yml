caption: LWE ameliorated phenotype of obesity in Lepr−/− rats. LWE, water extract
  of large yellow tea; WT, wild type rat; WL, wild type rat with LWE intervention;
  KO, leptin receptor knockout rat; KL, leptin receptor knockout rat with LWE intervention.
  (A) Body weight curves, (B) body weight, (C) fat mass ratio, (D) lean mass ratio,
  (E) liver weight, (F) inguinal pad weight, and (G) epididymal pad weight of the
  rats were measured, respectively. The adipocyte area of (H) inguinal pad and (I)
  epididymal pad; the image of (J) inguinal pad and (L) epididymal pad in different
  groups of rats; the image of the inguinal pad (K) and epididymal pad (M) by H&E
  staining were at 100 ×magnification. Values are means ± SEM (n = 4–6). Columns with
  different letters are significantly different (p < 0.05).
