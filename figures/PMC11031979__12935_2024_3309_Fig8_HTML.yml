caption: 'The correlation between LGALS3 or HCP5 and pathway score in HCC analyzed
  by Spearman method. The abscissa represents the expression of LGALS3 or HCP5 gene,
  and the ordinate represents the pathway score of this gene in HCC. The red curve
  represents the density distribution of LGALS3 or HCP5 gene, and the blue curve represents
  the distribution of pathway score. The positive correlation between LGALS3 or HCP5
  and pathway score are given (|r| >0.2, p value < 0.05, n = 371). Ten pathways are
  included: (A) tumor inflammation signature; (B) inflammatory response; (C) IL-10
  anti-inflammatory signaling pathway; (D) cellular response to hypoxia; (E) ECM-related
  genes; (F) apoptosis; (G) PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway; (H) P53 pathway; (I) degradation
  of ECM; (J) ferroptosis'
article_title: High LGALS3 expression induced by HCP5/hsa-miR-27b-3p correlates with
  poor prognosis and tumor immune infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma.
