caption: Bubble plots showing the enrichment analysis of altered metabolic pathways
  in roots. (A,B) represent the differential pathways between RE+ and RE− under 0
  mM and 200 mM NaCl concentrations, respectively. (C,D) represent the differential
  pathways between 200 mM and 0 mM NaCl treatment in RE+ and RE-, respectively. The
  plots were organized by pathway enrichment analysis (log10(p-values)) and pathway
  topology analysis (pathway impact).
