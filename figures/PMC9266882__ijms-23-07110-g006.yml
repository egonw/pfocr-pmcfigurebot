caption: Transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes between LPS and
  LPS + DSF groups. (A) Heat map representation showing a total of 2029 DGEs in control,
  LPS- and LPS + DSF-treated zebrafish embryos. (B) Volcano plots show a total of
  938 DGEs in LPS and LPS + DSF groups. (C) GO term analysis and (D) KEGG pathway
  analysis for up-regulating DEGs in LPS + DSF zebrafish embryos compared to the LPS
  group. (E) GO term analysis and (F) KEGG pathway analysis of down-regulated DEGs
  in LPS + DSF zebrafish embryos compared to the LPS group. The size of the dot indicates
  the number of genes enriched in an individual item. The color of the dot represents
  the p value.
