caption: ADSCs may delay the infiltration of lymphocytes and thus Sjögren's syndrome
  progression. (A) NOD mice were randomly divided into Control (PBS-), DEX- and ADSC-treatment
  groups (n=15 mice/group). (B) Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that, between
  13 and 17 weeks, the degree of lymphocyte infiltration in SMGs of NOD mice in the
  ADSC group (B1-B5) was significantly lower compared with the Control group (A1-A5),
  whereas the degree of lymphocyte infiltration in SMGs of NOD mice in the DEX group
  (C1-C5) was between the two. (C) At the same time, the number of LAs in the different
  groups was detected (black rectangles in B) and counted. *P<0.05 vs. 13 weeks. ADSCs,
  adipose-derived stem cells; DEX, dexamethasone; LA, lymphocyte aggregate; NOD, non-obese
  diabetic; SMG, submandibular gland.
