caption: 'FOXF2 oppositely regulates the transcription of WNT2B and FZD1 in luminal
  breast cancer and BLBC cells by recruiting NCoA3 and NCoR1, respectively.A, the
  expression levels of NCOR1 and NCOA3 in luminal and basal-like subtypes of breast
  cancer cells were compared. The data were mined from the combined gene-expression
  profiling dataset GSE12777_GSE15026_GSE65194 of the human breast cancer cell lines
  (n = 95). B, the mRNA and protein expression levels of NCOR1 and NCOA3 were detected
  by RT-qPCR and immunoblot. C and G, the interaction between FOXF2 and NCoA3 (C)
  or NCoR1 (G) in the indicated cells was assessed by Co-IP assay using anti-FLAG
  and anti-NCoA3 or anti-NCoR1 antibodies. D and H, the enrichment of the WNT2B and
  FZD1 promoter regions containing FOXF2-binding sites in the indicated cells transfected
  with FOXF2-FLAG plasmids was detected by ChIP-PCR and Re-ChIP-PCR analyses. The
  promoter region was first enriched with anti-FLAG antibody and then with anti-NCoA3
  (D) or anti-NCoR1 (H) antibody. E and I, the transcriptional activities of the WNT2B
  and FZD1 promoters in the indicated cells were assessed by dual-luciferase reporter
  assays. F and J, the mRNA and protein levels of WNT2B and FZD1 in the indicated
  cells were detected by RT-qPCR and immunoblot. ∗, p < 0.05 compared with control
  cells; #, p < 0.05 compared with FOXF2-overexpressing cells. Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.'
