caption: 'Experimental Timeline. All rats underwent the GWI paradigm with 2 levels
  of drug treatment (vehicle, PB) and 2 levels of stress (non-stressed control (NSC),
  repeated restraint stress (RRS)). Cohort #1 underwent in vivo microdialysis 100
  days after the treatment paradigm to assess the cholinergic response of the hippocampus
  and PFC to i.p. LPS at a delayed timepoint. Separate cohorts were used to assess
  immune responses at both the early (days 24–30, cohort #2) and delayed (days 100–105,
  cohort #3) timepoints in tissue homogenates and plasma 2 hours following i.p. saline
  or LPS administration.'
article_title: Pyridostigmine bromide elicits progressive and chronic impairments
  in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus
  of male rats.
