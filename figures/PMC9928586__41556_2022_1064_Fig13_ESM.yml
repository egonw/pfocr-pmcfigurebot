caption: '(a, b) Heatmaps of CellChat predictions of outgoing (A) and incoming (B)
  signaling patterns between the analyzed ASM and AFs. Bars represent the outgoing/incoming
  overall potential of each cluster (top) and pathway (right). Color intensity shows
  the relative strength of cluster contribution to the communication pattern. Dark
  green: high, White: low importance. (c, e) Balloon-plots of the top-20 NicheNet-predicted
  IGF1 (C), WNT5A (D) and BMP4 (E) -target genes, expressed in the ASM and AF clusters.
  Ligands (l-): blue. Receptors (r-): magenta. Balloon size: percent of positive cells.
  Color intensity: scaled expression. Blue: high, Gray: low. (f) Violin-plots of the
  IGF1-ligands and its receptor (IGF1R) in the indicated clusters, at 5–5.5, 8–8.5,
  10, 12 and 14 pcw cells. Expression levels: log2(normalized UMI-counts+1) (library
  size was normalized to 10.000). (g) HybISS spatial validation of IGF1 (white), WNT5A
  (green) and its predicted receptors FZD1 (magenta) and FZD7 (cyan) on 5 and 13 pcw
  lung sections. MYH11 (orange): airway smooth muscle. DAPI (gray): nuclei. Scale-bars:
  50 µm. (h) As in ‘F’ for WNT5A, FZD1 and FZD7. The ‘*’ indicate commended genes.'
