caption: '(A) The representative protein levels of IGF-II and p-JNK from the left
  ventricles in the normotensive group (WKY), untreated hypertensive group (SHR),
  and SHR rats with treated irbesartan (SHR-ARB), as measured by Western blot methods.
  The α-Tubulin served as an internal control. (B) Bars indicate the relative fold
  changes of protein levels relative to the Control group in IGF-II and p-JNK on α-Tubulin
  and show mean ± standard deviation (n = 8;8;8). ** p < 0.01: significant differences
  from the Control group. ## p < 0.01 indicates significant differences between the
  SHR group and the SHR-ARB group.'
