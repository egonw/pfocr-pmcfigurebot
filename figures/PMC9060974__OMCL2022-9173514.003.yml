caption: mmu-miR-9-5p regulates the SCRIB/β-catenin signaling pathway by directly
  targeting SCRIB. Western blot was used to detect possible signals for apoptosis.
  (a, b, d) p-AKT and β-catenin were upregulated (P < 0.05). (a, c, e, f) p-p38, p-JNK,
  and p-p65 were downregulated (P < 0.05). (g) The expression of SCRIB mRNA was upregulated
  in the mmp+ group than the control group (P < 0.05) and was inhibit by mmu-miR-9-5p
  (P < 0.05) (h, i) The expression of SCRIB was downregulated in the mmu-miR-9-5p
  group (P < 0.05) detected by Western blot. (j) Predicted binding sites of mmu-miR-9-5p
  and SCRIB. (k) Luciferase reporter assay suggests SCRIB is the direct binding to
  mmu-miR-9-5p (P < 0.05).
