caption: Cucurbitacin B down-regulated the expression of TNF-R1 without affecting
  the expression of TRADD, RIPK1, or TRAF2. (A–C) A549 cells were treated with or
  without cucurbitacin B at the indicated concentrations for 1 h, followed by the
  preparation of cytoplasmic fractions. TNF-R1 was detected by the anti-TNF-R1 antibody
  C25C1, which recognized an epitope in the intracellular domain. Blots are representative
  of three (A) and two (C) independent experiments. The amount of TNF-R1 was normalized
  to that of GAPDH. TNF-R1 protein (%) is shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent
  experiments (B). (D) A549 cells were pretreated with or without cucurbitacin B at
  the indicated concentrations for 1 h. TNF-R1 mRNA (fold) is shown as the mean ±
  S.E. of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001.
