figure_title: Epigenetic roles of 8-oxo-dG
caption: a 8-Oxo-dG-induced transcriptional mutation, which is caused by 8-oxo-dG
  in the template strand during transcription, triggering a C > A point mutation in
  mRNA via 8-oxo-dG•A base pairing. b 8-Oxo-dG-induced loss of integrity in transcriptional
  regulatory elements. 8-Oxo-dG and its repair intermediate, AP site (Ø), deteriorate
  the integrity of transcriptional regulatory elements, thus hindering the binding
  of transcription factors (TFs). 8-Oxo-dG, AP sites, and subsequent nicks in coding
  regions also inhibit mRNA transcription. c Transcriptional regulation mediated by
  8-oxo-dG and its repair proteins. 8-Oxo-dG, bound by OGG, and its intermediate AP
  site induce folding of quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) into a G-quadruplex structure
  (G4), which recruits various TFs to transcriptionally activate downstream genes
  (upper panel). Ligand-mediated activation (e.g., TNFα) of the signaling pathway
  generates ROS, which oxidize DNA sequences near NF-kB binding sites. The produced
  8-oxo-dG recruits the OGG1-NF-kB complex, thus activating the transcription of downstream
  genes (lower panel). d Interplay of 8-oxo-dG with epigenetic histone modifications.
  During the histone demethylation reaction, LSD1 generates local ROS (H2O2) that
  lead to the formation of 8-oxo-dG and AP sites in the promoter, which are occupied
  by OGG1 and APE1. Then, APE1 recruits other TFs, and its nick formation associates
  with topoisomerase II, eventually activating the transcription of downstream genes.
  e Interplay of 8-oxo-dG with DNA cytosine methylation (5mC). 8-Oxo-dG near CpG islands
  inhibits the binding of DNMT and MeCP2, thus passively interfering with 5mC (left
  panel). OGG1, which is associated with 8-oxo-dG, interacts with TET1, which oxidizes
  adjacent 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) for DNA demethylation (upper middle
  panel). During the DNA demethylation process of CpG islands, TET1 generates local
  ROS, which induce 8-oxo-dG associated with OGG1, thus activating the transcription
  of downstream genes (upper right panel). Oxidative DNA damage triggers the formation
  of the 8-oxo-dG and OGG1 complex, which recruits repressive complexes, including
  DNMT, and induces methylation of CpG islands, finally resulting in chromatin condensation
  and silencing of damaged DNA regions.
