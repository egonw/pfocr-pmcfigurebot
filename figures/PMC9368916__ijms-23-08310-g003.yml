caption: 'Distinct mode of transcriptional regulation for secondary metabolite biosynthetic
  pathways. (a) M-D plot of DEGs (trichomes versus stem tissue) in the MEP, MVA, hexanoate,
  and cannabinoid pathways, with corresponding enzyme names being similarly color-coded
  in the pathway schematic on the left. The numbers inside brackets indicate the numbers
  of DEGs. Note that the black arrow in the M-D plot illustrates the increasing gene
  regulation at the end of the MEP pathway. (b) Similar M-D plot and corresponding
  enzyme names in the context of the terpene biosynthetic pathways. Refer to  for
  corresponding gene IDs of enzymes. Enzyme abbreviations for MEP pathway (left to
  right): DXS (DOXP synthase); DXR (DXP reductoisomerase); CMS (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase); CMK (4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
