caption: Effects of chronic ethanol and dietary soy isolate on insulin-IRS-1-Akt pathway
  protein expression in temporal lobe. Long Evans male and female young adolescent
  rats were fed for 7 weeks with isocaloric liquid diets containing 0% or 37% (3 weeks)
  followed by 26% (4 weeks) ethanol and casein (standard) or soy isolate as the protein
  source. Temporal lobe homogenates were used to measure (A) IN-R, (B) IGF-1R, (C)
  IRS-1, (D) Akt, (E) GSK-3β, (F) PRAS40 and (G) p70S6K with the Total Akt Magnetic
  7-Plex Panel. Data from the male and female rats were combined since there were
  no sex-related differences. Graphed results reflect the mean ± S.D. of immunoreactivity
  expressed as fluorescence light units (FLU). Results were analyzed using two-way
  ANOVA tests () with post hoc Tukey tests. Significant P-Values are indicated above
  the bars. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; NS = not significant.
