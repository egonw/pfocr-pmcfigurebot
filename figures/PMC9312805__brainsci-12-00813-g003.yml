caption: 'Changes in protein levels in the TBCB and ERK1/2 signalling pathways after
  alcohol exposure and the protein levels of TBCB and α-tubulin after interfering
  with the ERK1/2 signalling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of phosphorylation
  levels and relative quantitative analysis of TBCB and MAPK (ERK1/2, p38, JNK) signalling
  pathways in astrocytes after 12 h of alcohol exposure (n = 6, p < 0.05). (B) Western
  blot analysis of the p-ERK1/2 to ERK1/2 ratio and protein levels of TBCB and α-tubulin
  in astrocytes after pretreatment with the ERK1/2-specific inhibitor U0126 or agonist
  TPA (n = 6, p < 0.05). (C) Western blot analysis of the p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio and
  protein levels of TBCB and α-tubulin in astrocytes after pretreatment with U0126
  or TPA before alcohol exposure (n = 6, p < 0.05). Con: control group; 12E: ethanol
  or alcohol exposure group; TAP: ERK1/2 agonist group; U0126: ERK1/2 inhibitor group;
  TPA + 12E: ERK1/2 agonist and ethanol exposure group; U0126 + 12E: ERK1/2 inhibitor
  and ethanol exposure group. **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001, ****: p < 0.0001.'
