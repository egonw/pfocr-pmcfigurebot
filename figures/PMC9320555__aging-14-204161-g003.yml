caption: Effects of BDDD-721 and curcumin on cell migration and invasion of medulloblastoma
  cells. (A) Cell migration ability was analyzed by Transwell assay without coated
  Matrigel. (B) Cell invasion ability was measured by Transwell assay with coated
  with Matrigel. (C) MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins were detected by western blot after
  20 Î¼M curcumin or BDDD-721 treatment for 24h.
article_title: Curcumin analogue BDDD-721 exhibits more potent anticancer effects
  than curcumin on medulloblastoma by targeting Shh/Gli1 signaling pathway.
