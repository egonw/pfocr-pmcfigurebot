caption: 'GC‐C is expressed in cortical neurons of the contralateral, but not the
  ipsilateral hemisphere. The localisation of GC‐C in the neurons was done by immunohistochemical
  staining of the ipsilateral peri‐ischaemic region and corresponding contralateral
  cortical areas of WT, GC‐C KO and UGN KO animals with GC‐C and NeuN antibodies.
  In the contralateral hemisphere of both wild‐type (WT) and UGN KO animals, GC‐C
  expression was co‐localised with NeuN, indicating that GC‐C was expressed in cortical
  neurons in areas unaffected by stroke. In the peri‐ischaemic area, GC‐C no longer
  co‐localised with NeuN in either animal strain and was expressed in another cell
  type. Brain slices from GC‐C KO animals were used as a negative control. Positive:
  slices were stained with GC‐C antibody. Negative: without GC‐C antibody. Merged1:
  merged images of NeuN and GC‐C staining. The bar represents 50 μm. Merged2: enlarged
  parts of Merged1 images; the bar represents 1 0 μm'
