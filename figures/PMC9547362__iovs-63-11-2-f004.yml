caption: Suppression of METTL3 attenuated inflammation through the NF-κB signaling
  pathway in mouse corneal stromal cells incubated with fungi. (A-E) The protein expression
  levels of METTL3, TRAF6, p-IκB/IκB and p-p65/p65 in corneal stromal cells infected
  with fungi were measured via western blotting. (F, G) Immunofluorescence staining
  was used to evaluate METTL3 and TRAF6 protein expression in corneal stromal cells
  treated with F. solani. The scale bar indicates 70 µm. (H) Quantification of IL-1β,
  IL-6, and TNF-α by RT–PCR. (I) The protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were
  determined by ELISAs; n = 6; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
