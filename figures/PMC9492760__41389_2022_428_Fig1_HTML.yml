figure_title: HPSE expression level is significantly higher in BRAF V600E-mutant compared
  to BRAF wild-type patients
caption: A Volcano maps of differentially expressed genes between BRAF V600E-mutant
  and wild-type colorectal cancer patients in the TCGA dataset (left) and GSE39582
  dataset (right). Dots represent genes. Significantly upregulated and downregulated
  genes, based on a cutoff fold change of 2 and an adjusted P-value at 0.05, are colored
  in orange and green, respectively. The top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes
  are colored in red and blue, respectively. Common six genes were labeled with gene
  symbols. The ggpubr and ggthemes R packages were used to generate the map. B Multiple
  linear regression analysis of HPSE expression levels in public datasets. Samples
  with missing values were removed. F test P < 0.001 in TCGA and GSE39582 datasets.
  Estimate (blocks in the center) and 95% confidence intervals (Whiskers of error
  bars) are shown. CI confidence intervals. C Expression levels of HPSE in BRAF V600E-mutant
  and BRAF wild-type CRC patients based on public data. Dots in violin plots represent
  samples. Centerlines indicate median, red dots indicate the mean, box plots indicate
  the quartiles, and bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Violin plots were generated
  using ggplot2 package and ggstatsplot package. A two-sided Welch’s t-test was used
  to determine P values. D Higher HPSE expression level in BRAF V600E-mutant CRC verified
  using frozen tissue of CRC samples from Zhongshan hospital. Locations of the primary
  tumor were unbalanced between BRAF V600E-mutant and wild-type samples (Table );
  however, no difference was reported in HPSE expression level between different primary
  tumor sites. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. The student’s t-test
  was used to calculate P values. ***P < 0.001, ns P > 0.05.
