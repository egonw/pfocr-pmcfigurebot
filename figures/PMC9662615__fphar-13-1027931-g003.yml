caption: 'Dose-response effect of V. album mother tinctures on the proliferation of
  MDA-MB-31 cell line assessed by MTT. (A) MDA-MB-231 winter-dose response effects
  after 24 h of treatment with MTs. (B) MDA-MB-231 winter-dose response effects after
  48 h of treatment with MTs. The final MTs concentrations tested were: 0.5; 1.0;
  2.0% v/v. The results are expressed as the mean ± standard error from three independent
  experiments done in triplicate, in relation to control cells (untreated and treated
  with ethanol). *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.0001 obtained with one-way ANOVA/Dunnet’s post
  hoc test. Legend symbols: (CT) control untreated cells; V. album subsp. album growing
  on Malus domestica (M–W), Quercus petraea (Q–W) and Ulmus carpinifolia (U–W); V.
  album subsp. abietis growing on Abies alba (A–W); and V. album subsp. austriacum
  growing on Pinus sylvestris (P–W). Samples were harvested in winter (W) season.'
