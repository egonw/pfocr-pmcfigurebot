figure_title: Ca2+-dependent signaling is required for TFEB/TFE3 nuclear localization
  but not for TFEB dephosphorylation in cells lacking Tsg101
caption: '(A) Maximum intensity projection confocal images of fixed RKO cells at 48
  h post transfection (48 hpt) showing intracellular distribution of TFEB or TFE3
  (green) in ESCRT-I–depleted (siTsg101#2) or control (Ctrl#1, nontargeting siRNA)
  cells upon 2 h treatment with vehicle (Vh, DMSO), BAPTA-AM (10 μM), or ML-SI1 (25
  μM). Cell nuclei marked with DAPI stain (blue). Scale bar, 50 μm. Dot plots on the
  right show the percentage of cells with nuclear TFEB or TFE3 localization. Values
  derived from independent experiments (dots) and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented.
  Statistical significance tested by comparison to siCtrl#1 conditions. ns, nonsignificant,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (B) Representative Western blots showing levels of phosphorylated
  (at Ser122 or Ser211) or total TFEB and of Tsg101 and vinculin (loading control)
  in lysates obtained 48 hpt from control (siCtrl#1) or Tsg101-depleted RKO cells
  treated for 3 h with the indicated reagents: vehicle (Vh, DMSO), 10 or 20 μM BAPTA,
  25 μM ML-SI1or 25 μM CsA.'
