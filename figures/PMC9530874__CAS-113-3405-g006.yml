caption: LC3+ extracellular vesicles (EVs) activate lung fibroblasts to produce CCL2
  via the TLR2‐MyD88‐NF‐kB pathway. (A, B), BALB/c mice (n = 5) were i.v. injected
  with PKH67‐labeled LC3+ EVs. PKH67+ cells in the lung (A) and the proportion of
  indicated cells in PKH67+ cells (B) were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). (C),
  Confocal microscopy images of lung fibroblasts (red) ingesting of PKH67‐labeled
  LC3+ EVs (green) (scale bar, 50 μm). (D), The lung fibroblasts treated with 4 T1‐LC3+
  EVs (10 μg/ml) underwent RNA‐sequencing assay, which was followed by functional
  enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes. (E), Heatmap of inflammatory
  genes that were enriched in an unbiased Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Analysis was
  performed on genes significantly upregulated in control versus LC3+ EV–treated lung
  fibroblasts. (F), ELISA detection of CCL2 secretion by lung fibroblasts incubated
  with different concentrations of LC3+ EVs for 48 h. G‐H, The lung fibroblasts isolated
  from mice on day 10 after Becn1 NC‐ or Becn1 KD‐4 T1 cell s.c. injection (G) or
  after LC3+ EVs i.v. injection (H) were cultured for 48 h. CCL2 levels were determined
  by ELISA. (I), ELISA detection of CCL2 secretion by lung fibroblasts purified from
  WT, Tlr4 −/−, Tlr2 −/−, Myd88 −/−mice incubated with LC3+ EVs for 48 h. (J), Western
  blot analyses of the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, IκB, p65 in lung fibroblasts treated
  with LC3+ EVs. (K), The lung fibroblasts were pretreated with NF‐κB inhibitor for
  1 h and then cocultured with LC3+ EVs for 48 h. CCL2 levels in supernatants were
  determined by ELISA. Data were expressed as means ± SEM.
