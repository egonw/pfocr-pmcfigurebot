caption: Beneficial effects of hesperetin on natural aging and age-related diseases
  in rodents and humans. (A) Hesperetin delays aging and promotes healthy longevity
  in rodents. There are many beneficial effects of hesperetin on the aging process
  in old mice, including improvements in healthy lifespan, whole-body metabolism,
  and glucose homeostasis. The beneficial effects of hesperetin on multiple tissues
  in aged rodents have been investigated and these include the brain, heart, skeletal
  muscle, liver, and kidneys. In the brain, hesperetin improves emotional memory functioning,
  hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and reduces oxidative stress in aged rats. In the
  hearts of older mice, hesperetin slows down heart aging, including an enhancement
  of mechanical and electrical cardiac functioning, reductions in fibrosis and ultrastructural
  damage, and change toward a younger transcriptome pattern. In the skeletal muscle
  of older mice, hesperetin slows down muscle aging, including improvements in muscle
  functioning; reductions in fibrosis, and levels of muscle fiber degeneration, and
  ultrastructural damage; and a change toward a younger transcriptome pattern. In
  the liver of aged rats, hesperetin reduces oxidative stress, enhances antioxidant
  enzyme activity, and improves the phospholipid composition of cell membranes. In
  the kidney of aged rats, hesperetin exerts anti-inflammation and antioxidant effects
  via the modulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. (B) Hesperetin exerts a
  range of biological effects that improve several age-related diseases in rodents,
  such as neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease), eye disease
  (cataracts), cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
  and ischemic heart disease), and metabolic syndrome, specifically diabetes. These
  phenotypic improvements are associated with the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
  efficacies of hesperetin. (C) The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of
  hesperetin regarding age-related diseases in rodents were deciphered using different
  cell lines, such as neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y and HT22), immune cells (THP-1), cardiac
  myoblast cells (H9c2), β-cells (e.g., INS-1), and myoblast cells (L6). (D) In clinical
  studies, the efficacy and safety of hesperetin had been evaluated in overweight
  and obese human subjects. The biological efficacy of hesperetin in human subjects
  includes improved glucose homeostasis and vascular function and reduced inflammation.
