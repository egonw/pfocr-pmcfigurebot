caption: 'MYH9 promoted cell motility in HNC cells. (A) Examination of MYH9 expression
  level in five HNC cell lines (Detroit 562, BM2, OC3, C8, SAS, OECM-1) and two lines
  of keratinocytes (K2 and NOK) using the RT-qPCR method. (B) The efficacy of MYH9-shRNA
  knockdown in OECM-1 and Detroit 562 cells. The MYH9 protein level was determined
  by the western blot method to show the effect of MYH9 silencing. The GAPDH level
  was used as an internal control. (C) Transfection of MYH9-shRNA significantly decreased
  cell migration, as determined by an in vitro wound healing assay, scale bar 40 μm.
  (D) Transfection of MYH9-shRNA suppressed cell invasion, as determined by a Matrigel
  invasion assay, scale bar 20 μm. (E) Significant increases of ECM/MMPs-associated
  gene expressions in the tumor samples compared to normal samples. The gene expression
  data, including FN1, ITGA6, FSCN1, VIM, MMP2, and MMP9, were retrieved from the
  TCGA-HNSC dataset. (F) Correlative expressions between MYH9 and ECM/MMPs associated
  molecules FN1, ITGA6, FSCN1, VIM, MMP2, and MMP9 in the HNC tumor samples. The gene
  expression data were retrieved from the TCGA-HNSC dataset. All of the experiments
  were performed at least three times independently, and a typical result was shown.
  The error bars shown in the relevant figures indicated the standard deviation of
  the quantification results in all experiments. (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***:
