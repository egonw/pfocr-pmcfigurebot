caption: DSC2 inhibits the cell proliferation ability in vitro and affects cell cycle-related
  proteins. (A) The clone formation ability of overExp-DSC2-transfected LM3 and shRNA-DSC2-1-transfected
  7721 cells was shown by clone formation assay (repeated three times). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (B, C) The cell viability of overExp-DSC2-transfected
  LM3 and shRNA-DSC2-1-transfected 7721 cells were detected by CCK-8 and EdU assay
  (repeated three times for both). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (D) Western
  blot analysis of the protein levels of Cyclin D1, Cyclin B1, CDK1, and CDK2 from
  LM3 and 7721 cells transfected with overExp-DSC2 and shRNA-DSC2-1 (repeated three
  times). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
