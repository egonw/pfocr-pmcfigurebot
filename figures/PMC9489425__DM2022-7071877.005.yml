caption: miR-22-3p targets PTEN and activates the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (a)
  The predicted binding sites of miR-22-3p within the 3′-UTR of Pten. (b) Dual-luciferase
  reporter assays showed miRNA-22-3p cotransfected with wild-type or mutation Pten
  3′-UTR in SCs. (c) Pten mRNA expression in SCs after the treatment with miR-22-3p
  mimic, miR-22-3p inhibitor, and NC. (d) Effects of miR-22-3p mimic and miR-22-3p
  inhibitor on the protein expressions of AKT/mTOR pathway compare with control group.
  Data are expressed as means ± SD. Statistical significance was obtained with unpaired
  Student's t test or one way ANOVA. ∗∗ means p < 0.01; NS means no significant. ADSC-Exos,
  the exosomes extracted from Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells; SCs, Schwann
  cells; miR, miRNA.
