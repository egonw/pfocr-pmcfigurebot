caption: 'The enhancing influence of Rh2 on the expression of BDNF‐CREB signaling
  pathway was blocked by the inhibitor K252a in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable
  mild stress (CUMS). BDNF, pERK/ERK, pAKT/AKT, and pCREB/CREB protein levels were
  lower in (CUMS + Rh2 + K252a)‐treated mice than the (CUMS + Rh2)‐treated mice. The
  obtained data are expressed as the means ± SEM, n = 5. **p < .01 when compared to
  vehicle; ##p < .01 when compared to CUMS. The comparisons were made by two‐way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni''s test'

  effects in a CUMS‐induced mice model of depression.
