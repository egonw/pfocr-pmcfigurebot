caption: Most significantly enriched GO biological processes in downregulated transcripts.
  Panther pathway analysis was used to detect the enriched biological processes represented
  in the downregulated transcripts. Redundant overlapping terms were merged together
  and processes not directly relevant to the cell type were removed. The top 10 most
  enriched processes are depicted with their mean fold enrichment. Error bars represent
  the upper- and lower-fold enrichment values for the merged terms. Statistical significance
  is indicated by the false discovery rate (FDR)—for the merged terms, this is the
  mean FDR.
