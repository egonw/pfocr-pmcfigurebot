caption: DNMT3A is a target of miR-26a-5p. (a) The binding sites of miR-26a-5p with
  3′UTR of DNMT3A were predicated using Starbase database (http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/index.php).
  (b) The position of DNMT3A bind with miR-26a-5p was illustrated according to University
  of California Santa Cruz Genomics Institute (UCSC, http://genome.ucsc.edu/). (c)
  The dual-luciferase activity of wild/mutant type DNMT3A remodified reporter gene
  was cotransfected with miR-26a-5p mimic and its negative control. (d, e) The mRNA
  and protein expressions of DNMT3A were individually examined by qRT-PCR and western
  blotting after miR-26a-5p upregulation/downregulation. (f) The DNMT3A expression
  in NSCLC tumor tissues (N = 20) and adjacent normal tissues (N = 20) was detected
  by qRT-PCR. (g) Overall survival between high DNMT3A expression group and low DNMT3A
  expression group was determined by Kaplan-Meier plot using log-rank test. (h) The
  DNMT3A expression in NSCLC cell lines and BEAS2B was determined using qRT-PCR. (i)
  The DNMT3A expression in LUAD tumor samples (N = 535) and normal samples (N = 59)
  was based on TCGA database. (j) Overall survival between high DNMT3A expression
  group and low DNMT3A expression group was determined by Kaplan-Meier plot using
  log-rank test in TCGA database. Control group was used as the blank control. ∗∗∗P
