caption: 'Overexpression of SUN5 promoted migration, while knockdown of SUN5 inhibited
  the migration of colorectal cancer cells in vitro. (A–C) Overexpression or knockdown
  of SUN5 promoted or inhibited cell migration as analyzed by wound-healing (scale
  bar: 200 μm) and Transwell assay (scale bar: 100 μm). (D) E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
  and vimentin were determined by Western blotting after overexpression or knockdown
  of SUN5 in LoVo and DLD-1 cells (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).'
