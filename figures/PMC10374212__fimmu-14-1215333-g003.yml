caption: Activation of membrane receptor (priming signal) leads to acceleration of
  the intracellular NF-κB signaling pathway that translocates the inflammasome components
  such as NLRP3 (sensor), and caspase-1 to the cytosol. CYP2E1 mediated ROS production
  alters the intercellular organelle integrity as well as mitochondrial dysfunction
  via cytochrome C release. The endogenous factors/secondary signals such as cytochrome
  C, ATP, ROS act as mediators of NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation, and facilitate
  autoproteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 which, in turn, cleaves the pro-interleukins
  IL-1β, IL-18 and Gasdermin D (GSDMD). Ultimately the cell undergoes pyroptotic cell
  death, further worsening the tissue microenvironment.
