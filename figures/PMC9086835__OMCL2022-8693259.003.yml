caption: 'Silencing MALAT1 or MYBL2 suppresses the expression of phospho-mTOR. Representative
  images (a) and quantification (b) of EdU assay formed by PC-3 cell line treated
  with vector control or mTOR pathway inhibitor rapamycin. Scale bars: 50 μm. Representative
  images (c) and quantification (d) of EdU assay formed by MALAT1 or MYBL2 knockdown
  PC-3 cell line and those cell lines treated with mTOR pathway activator MHY1485.
  Scale bars: 50 μm. (e) Representative images of colonies formed by vector control
  PC-3 cell line, added rapamycin PC-3 cell line, MALAT1 or MYBL2 knockdown PC-3 cell
  line, and those two cell lines treated with MHY1485. (f) Quantification of colonies.
  Western blot examines mTOR and phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR) level in MALAT1 or MYBL2 knockdown
  PC-3 cell line (g), and quantification (h) of western blot result. All samples were
  normalized to GAPDH mRNA and protein levels. The error bars indicate SD (n = 3).
  Student t test was used. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
