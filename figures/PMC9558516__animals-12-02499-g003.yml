caption: (a) Significantly distinct COGs determined by ALDEx2 algorithm between the
  4 and 16-month-old group using the MA plot (BH adjusted p-value < 0.05 and effect
  size > 3 (distinct in 4 months) or effect size < −3 (distinct in 16 months)). Only
  the significantly distinct COGs are categorized by the function of COGs. (b) The
  heatmap presents the predicted functions based on significantly distinct COGs in
  the 4-month-old and 16-month-old groups. The heatmap colors indicate the normalized
  relative abundance of COGs numbers based on the KEGG pathway using the PICRUSt2.
  (c) Circular dendrogram of COGs of the 4-month-old and 16-month-old groups present
  the outliers, respectively, indicated in green and red. The second inner side, the
  second position from the most outside, showed COG classes indicating the “Cellular
  process and signaling” (red), “Information storage and processing” (emerald green),
  “Metabolism” (blue), and the “Poorly characterized” (yellow). The next inner side
  showed the COGs functional categories. “Metabolism” of COGs classes, “G, Carbohydrate
  transport and metabolism”, “E, amino acid transport and metabolism”, and “F, Nucleotide
  transport and metabolism” categories are shown in the 16-month-old group, and the
  “H, Coenzyme transport and metabolism” and “I, Lipid transport and metabolism” are
  shown in the 4-month-old group.
