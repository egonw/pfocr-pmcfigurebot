caption: 'Effect induced by pretreatment with the RhoA inhibitor CCG-1423 or the ROCK
  inhibitor KD025 alone and combined with the H2S-producing enzyme inhibitor on ACh-induced
  dilation in KCl-preconstricted rat cerebral basilar arteries with endothelium (mean
  ± SD, n = 6). (a) Pretreatment with CCG-1423 alone and combined with the CSE inhibitor
  PPG or the 3-MST inhibitor Asp. (b) Pretreatment with KD025 alone and combined with
  PPG or Asp. CCG-1423: 1 × 10–6 mol/L, KD025: 1 × 10–6 mol/L, PPG: 100 μmol/L, Asp:
  10 μmol/L. **P < 0.01 vs PSS; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs the CCG-1423 group or the
  KD025 group.'
