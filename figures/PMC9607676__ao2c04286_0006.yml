caption: 'NNMT aggravated the progression of cancer cells. (A) Overexpression of NNMT
  in A549 increased the growth rate of cells; cell growth was detected using the CCK-8
  kit. (B) Representative images of colony forming assay for Ctrl and NNMT-OE cells,
  indicating that NNM-OE promoted colony forming ability of A549 cells. (C) Cell migration
  was enhanced in NNMT-OE cells compared with that in control cells, assessed by the
  wound healing assay. Cells were imaged at 0 hand 72 h after scratching. Scale bar:
  200 μm. (D) Western blotting of EMT markers such as ZO-1, Cytokeratin-18, E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, Snail, and β-actin expression in Ctrl and NNMT-OE A549 cells. (E) 2
  × 106 of Ctrl and NNMT-OE cells were injected into the right underarm of nude mice
  (n = 5). Tumor volume was measured every 2 days. SD is indicated by error bars.
  *p < 0.05 versus control cells. (F) Percentage of viable cells between Ctrl and
  NNMT-OE A549 cells treated with different concentration of cisplatin (n = 5). Data
  were analyzed using Student’s t test. ****p < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01.
  *p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All values represent mean from
  at least three biological replicates ± SD.'
