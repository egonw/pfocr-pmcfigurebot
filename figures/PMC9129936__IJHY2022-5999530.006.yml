caption: 'Predicted metagenomes functional analysis by PICRUSt. (a) Bar chart shows
  that different relative abundance predicted function of gut bacteria in all individuals
  on the first KEEG pathway level and (b) predicted functions on the second KEEG pathway
  level. PC1 represents the first principal component, and the percentage represents
  the contribution of the first principal component to the sample difference; PC2
  represents the second principal component, and the percentage represents the contribution
  of the second principal component to the sample difference (PC1:64.7%; PC2: 21.9%).
  The direction and length of the arrow represent the degree of dominance of the prediction
  functions in the sample/group in that direction, the longer the length, the stronger
  the dominance. CPaS: cellular processes and signaling; Trns: translation; EnrM:
  energy metabolism; RpaR: replication and repair; AmAM: amino acid metabolism; CrbM:
  carbohydrate metabolism; MmpT: membrane transport; SgnT: signal transduction; MmbT:
  membrane transport; CllM: cell motility GBaM: glycan biosynthesis and metabolism;
  EnrM: energy metabolism.'
