figure_title: Knockdown of KIF15 inhibited prostate cancer development in vitro
caption: A CCK8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation of DU 145 and PC-3 cells
  in shCtrl and shKIF15 groups with time from 24 h to 120 h. B After lentivirus infection
  of DU 145 cells and PC-3 cells, the number of colonies of shKIF15 groups and shCtrl
  group were counted and compared during 7 days of culturing. C 5 days after lentivirus
  infection, the apoptotic cell percentage of the shKIF15 group and shCtrl group was
  detected by flow cytometry. D Cell motility of DU 145 and PC-3 cells with or without
  KIF15 knockdown was detected by Transwell assay. Data were shown as mean with SD.
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
