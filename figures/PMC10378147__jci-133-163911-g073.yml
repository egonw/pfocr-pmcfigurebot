figure_title: Foxm1 regulates multiple signaling pathways in HSCs
caption: (A) Heatmap of expression profiles for genes with P < 0.05 (576 genes). (B)
  RT-PCR analysis shows the expression level of genes involved in stem cell functions
  and DNA damage repair pathway in HSCs from WT(n = 3) or Foxm1 HET(n = 3) mice. (C
  and D) GSEA plots show, respectively, a positive association with “KEGG Lysosome”
  and “GSE14769 UNSTIM VS 20MIN LPS BMDM UP” in Foxm1 HET HSCs compared with WT HSCs.
  (E and F) GSEA plots show a negative association with “HEME Metabolism” and “DNA
  Dependent DNA Replication Maintenance of Fidelity” in Foxm1 HET HSCs compared with
  WT HSCs. (G) Correlation between FOXM1 and PARP1 in MDS with deletion of chromosome
  5q [del(5q) MDS] (n = 47). P value was calculated by Spearman’s r correlation. (H)
  Microarray analysis of PARP1 in CD34+ cells from individuals in the healthy control
  group (n =16) or from patients with del(5q) MDS (n = 43). (I) RT-PCR analysis of
  FOXM1 and PARP1 in MDSL cells transduced FOXM1 shRNAs and control vector; the results
  were normalized to ACTB expression. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, 2-tailed Student’s t test.
