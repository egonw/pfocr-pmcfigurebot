caption: 'Diagram of drug development to target the CWI signaling pathway in filamentous
  fungi. In M. oryzae, Pkc1 is a protein kinase C, Mps1 is a MAP kinase, and Pig1
  and Rlm1 are transcription factors. SCD (encoding scytalone dehydratase), 3HNR (trihydroxy-naphthalene
  reductase), and 4HNR (1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-naphthalene reductase) are involved in
  the biosynthesis of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin in several plant pathogens,
  including M. oryzae. AGS1 encodes α-1,3-glucan synthase. Abbreviations: AP, appressorium;
  GT, germ tube; CO, conidium; IH, invasive hyphae; AG, α-1,3-glucan.'
