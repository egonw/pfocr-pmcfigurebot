caption: GE protects mitochondrial function in RPE cells induced by high glucose.
  (A) The CCK-8 assay was used to detect the changes in cell activity after high glucose
  combined with GE treatment under hyperglycemia; (B) RT-PCR was used to detect the
  changes in CYT C1 expression after high glucose combined with GE treatment under
  hyperglycemia; (C) the results of Seahorse cell energy metabolism analysis; (D-G)
  energy metabolism analysis results showed the changes in the basal respiration rate,
  maximum respiratory capacity, and ATP synthesis capacity after high glucose combined
  with GE treatment under hyperglycemia (***P<0.01, **P<0.05, *P<0.1). OD, optical
  density; GE, genipin; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; OCR, O2 consumption rate; ATP,
  adenosine triphosphate; RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase
  chain reaction.
article_title: Genipin protects against mitochondrial damage of the retinal pigment
  epithelium under hyperglycemia through the AKT pathway mediated by the miR-4429/JAK2
  signaling axis.
