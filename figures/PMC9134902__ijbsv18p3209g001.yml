caption: High macrophage infiltration in KIRC correlates to worse prognosis. A. Comparison
  of the degree of immune cells infiltration among eight different kinds of cancers.
  B. Proportion of different types of immune cells resided in KIRC tissue. C. The
  survival curve of KIRC patients with low and high degree of macrophage infiltration
  in the KIRC tissue. D. The expression level of CD68 and CD206 in cancer tissues
  was higher than para-cancerous tissues (p<0.001).
