caption: Apigenin may ameliorate HUA and renal injury through regulation of UA metabolism
  and the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The black arrow indicates the changes of biomarkers
  in HUA mice induced by PO and Hypox, and the red arrow indicates the changes of
  biomarkers in HUA mice after apigenin intervention.
