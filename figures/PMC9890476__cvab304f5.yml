caption: PDE10A-modulated SMC proliferation is associated with CNP/NPR2 signalling
  pathway. (A) Relative mRNA levels of NPR1 and NPR2 in rat SMCs. An unpaired Student’s
  t-test with Welch’s correction was performed. n = 3 for each group. (B) RT-qPCR
  showing the level of NPR2 in SMCs treated with control or NPR2 siRNA. The expression
  level was normalized to the control siRNA-treated group. A one-sample t-test was
  performed to determine the knockdown efficiency. n = 3 for each group. (C) Percentages
  of S-phase cells treated with 2.5 μM MP-10, NPR2 siRNA, or both. A Welch’s ANOVA
  with Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test was applied. n = 3 for each group. (D)
  RT-qPCR results showing the level of NPPC (encoding a precursor of CNP) in SMCs
  treated with control or NPRC siRNA. The mRNA level was normalized to the control
  siRNA-treated group. A one-sample t-test was performed to determine the knockdown
  efficiency. n = 3 for each group. (E) Percentages of S-phase cells treated with
  2.5 μM MP-10, NPPC siRNA, or both. A Welch’s ANOVA with Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons
  test was applied. n = 3 for each group. (F) Percentages of rat SMCs in the S-phase
  after being treated with 2.5 μM MP-10, 1 μM CNP, or both. A Welch’s ANOVA with Dunnett’s
  T3 multiple comparisons test was performed. n = 3 for each group. (G and H) Confocal
  microscopic images (left panels) showing the signals of EGFP-tagged PDE10A (green)
  and mCherry-tagged NPR2 (red) overexpressed in 293A cells (G) or rat SMCs (H). Scale
  bar = 10μm (G) or 20 μm (H). The intensities of green and red signals across the
  cell were measured (right panels). (I) Immunoblot showing PDE10A and NPR2 from co-immunoprecipitation.
  Flag-tagged PDE10A and HA-tagged NPR2 were overexpressed in 293A cells. All data
  are shown as mean ± SEM. n = 3 for each group. ns, not significant.
