caption: miR-139-5p is involved in the oncogenic roles of SH3BP5-AS1 in pancreatic
  cancer. A Venn diagram showing the potential target miRNAs of SH3BP5-AS1 based on
  the public database ENCORI and the DIANA Tool. B RNA pulldown assay was performed
  to prove miRNA-139-5p was the most enriched in the precipitate of SH3BP5-AS1 than
  other miRNA candidates. C Correlation analysis of SH3BP5-AS1 and miRNA-139-5p. D
  Schematic diagram of the binding sites between SH3BP5-AS1 and miRNA-139-5p. E, F
  A dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to determine the relative luciferase
  activities in pancreatic cancer cells following transfection with the indicated
  constructs. G miRNA-139-5p was overexpressed following silencing of SH3BP5-AS1 in
  BxPC-3 and MIA Paca-2 cells. H–J An RIP assay was conducted to evaluate the relative
  enrichment of SH3BP5-AS1 and miRNA-139-5p in anti-IgG- or anti-AGO2-specific immunoprecipitates
  in H293T cells. K miRNA-139-5p was downregulated following SH3BP5-AS1 overexpression
  in PANC-1 cells. L–N An RIP assay was conducted to evaluate the relative enrichment
  of SH3BP5-AS1 and miRNA-139-5p in anti-IgG- or anti-AGO2-specific immunoprecipitates
  in MIA Paca-2 cells. O–R An RNA pull-down assay was conducted to detect the interaction
  among LNCAROD, miR-145-5p, and AGO2 in H293T and MIA Paca-2 cells. Data are shown
  as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01
