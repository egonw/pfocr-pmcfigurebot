caption: Illustration of the measurement of ChT. (A) OCT fundus analysis template
  of guinea pigs. (B) Structural images captured by OCT showed the structure of the
  defined region; the red lines represent the inner concentric circle (600 µm, green
  arrow) and outer concentric circle (1050 µm, green arrow). The optic disc was defined
  as the circle center, and the region of interest in each quadrant was located between
  the border of the choroidal layer and the two striped green lines.
