caption: Role of GPX4 in lipid peroxidation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are
  major components of cell membrane phospholipid bilayers and are susceptible to oxidative
  damage that produces the toxic lipid oxidation product PLOOH. In contrast, membrane
  system xcâˆ’ is a heterodimeric complex composed of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2, which mediates
  cystine uptake into cells that is followed by GSH synthesis via the GCLC-GSS pathway.
  GSH is a co-factor in the catalytic cycle of GPX4 that detoxifies PLOOH to the lipid
  alcohol PLOH. Therefore, the pharmacological inhibition of GCLC, SLC7A11, and GPX4
  using indicated small-molecular compounds can promote or enhance lipid peroxidation.
