caption: 'Overexpression of SERPINA3C in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) protects
  mice against DIO and metabolic disorders. 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice with 4-week
  HFD feeding were injected with AAV in iWAT locally. HFD feeding was continued until
  mice were 24-week-old before mice were sacrificed for analyses. A: BW of the mice
  during 16-week HFD feeding. B: Representative picture of the mice after 16-week
  HFD feeding. C: Body composition in the mice was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance.
  n = 6. D: Representative images of adipose tissues and liver from the mice. E: Weights
  of adipose tissues and liver from the mice. F: Serum TG, TC, LDL, HDL levels of
  the mice after overnight fasting. G: The average values of the whole-body oxygen
  consumption rate (VO2) were measured by metabolic cages for the mice. n = 6. H:
  The average values of the whole-body CO2 generation (VCO2) were measured by metabolic
  cages for the mice. n = 6. I: Glucose concentrations during an i.p. glucose tolerance
  test (GTT) after mice were injected with AAV for 3 weeks. J: Area under the curve
  analysis of (I). K: Glucose concentrations during an insulin tolerance test (ITT)
  after mice were injected with AAV for 4 weeks. L: Area under the curve analysis
  of (K). M: Serum insulin level of the mice at basal condition of (K). For statistical
  analyses, two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni’s post hoc tests were performed
  in (A), (I), and (K). Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests were performed in (C),
  (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (L) and (M). For statistical analyses in (A), (C), (E)–(L),
  data were compared between the AAV-Vector and AAV-SERPINA3C mice. All values are
  represented as means with error bars representing S.D. ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01.
  n = 7 for each group unless otherwise mentioned.'
