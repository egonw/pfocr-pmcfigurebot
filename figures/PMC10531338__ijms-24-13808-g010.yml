caption: Combined analysis of DEGs and DEPs. (A) a nine quadrant diagram of protein
  and mRNA associations. Each point represents one gene. Quadrants 1 and 9 indicate
  the genes negatively correlated with proteins. Quadrants 3 and 7 show the genes
  positively correlated with proteins. Quadrants 1, 2, and 4 indicate that the protein
  abundance was lower than the RNA abundance. Quadrant 5 shows that the proteins and
  RNAs were similarly expressed without differences between WT and lhy7.1. Quadrants
  6, 8, and 9 indicate the genes in which the abundance was lower than protein abundance.
  (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs with same expression trend as DEPs. (C) KEGG
  enrichment analysis of DEPs with the same expression trend as DEGs. The rich factor
  represents the ratio of DEGs annotated to the pathway to all genes annotated to
  the pathway.
