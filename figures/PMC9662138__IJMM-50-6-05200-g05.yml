caption: Effects of GADD45A on cell viability and apoptosis of CMEC via the JNK/p38
  MAPK signaling pathway. (A) Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8
  assay in CMECs. (B and C) Apoptotic rates were determined by flow cytometry. (D)
  Protein expression levels of BCL2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 3 were determined
  by western blotting analysis. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. CMEC, cardiac microvascular endothelial cells; GADD45A,
  growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible α; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation; NC, negative
  control; siRNA, small interfering RNA.
article_title: Role of GADD45A in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion through mediation
  of the JNK/p38 MAPK and STAT3/VEGF pathways.
