figure_title: Mcl-1 and AKT/PI3Kβ inhibitor combination effectively kills PTEN-deficient
  breast cancer cells resistant to AKT/PI3Kβ inhibitors
caption: A Crystal violet staining in EVSA-T TSC2, INPPL1 and PIK3R2 KO cells treated
  with the indicated drugs. B Annexin-V staining in EVSA-T TSC2 knockout and control
  cells treated with the indicated drugs for 2 h. C Western blot analysis of PI3K
  pathway effectors (pAKT, pPRAS40, pS6,p4E-BP1), pNDRG1 and PARP in EVSA-T INPPL1,
  TSC2 and PIK3R2 KO cells treated with the indicated drugs for 4 h. Data are representative
  of three independent experiments.
article_title: AKT-mTORC1 reactivation is the dominant resistance driver for PI3Kβ/AKT
  inhibitors in PTEN-null breast cancer and can be overcome by combining with Mcl-1
  inhibitors.
