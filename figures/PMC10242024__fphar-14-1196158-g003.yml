caption: BTD induced apoptosis. (A) KEGG gene enrichment analysis of HCT116 cells
  treated with 5 μM BTD for 24 h. (B) Cell nuclear changes were detected by Hoechst
  33,258 staining after treatment with BTD (0, 5 or 10 μM) for 24 h, then visualized
  using a fluorescence microscope (×200). (C) Cells were treated with BTD (0, 0.625,
  1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 μM) for 24 h, then apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry.
  (D) Levels of apoptosis. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation.
