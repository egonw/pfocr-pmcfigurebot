caption: Effects of UEC4-1 on key genes of the lactation signaling pathway in MCF-10A
  cells. (A) Level of BLG, CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN3 and CyclinD1 protein were assessed by
  Western blotting analysis; (B) Changes in the level of lactation- and signaling-related
  protein were assessed by Western blotting analysis. Î²-Actin was assessed as a loading
  control. * significantly different from the control group at p < 0.05, ** significantly
  different from the control group at p < 0.01.
