caption: The PAM signaling pathways. PAM pathway can be activated by G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),
  insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (InsR/IGF-1R), which PtdIns (4,5)
  P2 (PIP2) to generate the second messenger PtdIns (3,4,5) P3 (PIP3) []. PTEN (phosphatase
  and tensin homolog) dephosphorylates PIP3 to generate PIP2, while INPP4B (inositol
  polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II B) dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4)P2 to generate
  PtdIns(3)P (PI3P). Proteins, containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, are recruited
  to the cytomembrane by PIP3, including AKT, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
  1 (PDK1), and serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK). The main downstream
  target of PI3K is AKT. It is activated by PDK1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), and
  phosphorylates a large number of downstream effector proteins, including mTOR complex
  1 (mTORC1), forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), glycogen synthesis kinase (GSK3) and
  murine double minute 2 (MDM2). The AKT-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3Î², FOXO1
  and MDM2 directly or indirectly controls cellular growth and survival. The activated
  mTORC1 ultimately regulates cellular processes, such as the initiation of mRNA transcription,
  cell growth, autophagy and protein synthesis, via phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1
  [,]. In addition, mTORC2 can phosphorylate both IGF-1R and AKT []. S6K-mediated
  phosphorylation of PDK1 negatively feed back to inhibit PDK1 []. PKC and SGK are
  also involved in PI3K signaling independent of AKT.
