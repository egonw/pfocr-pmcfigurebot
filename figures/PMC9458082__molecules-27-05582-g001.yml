caption: 'The structures of human enzymes from the melatonin synthesis pathway, both
  original apo-proteins (left) and modeled Ni(II)-bound forms (right). Presented are
  tryptophan 5-hydroxylase 1 (TPH1, PDB: 5L01, (A,B)), aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase
  (AADC, PDB: 3RBF, (C,D)), serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT, AlphaFold: AF-Q16613-F1,
  (E,F)), and acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, PDB: 4A6E, (G,H)). The nonapeptide
  fragments studied in this work are depicted as violet strands, Ser/Thr-Xaa-His fragments
  are shown as licorice, and Ni(II) ions are shown as orange spheres. The remaining
  parts of the proteins are represented by gray surfaces.'
