caption: Fit of responses measured after partial irreversible receptor inactivation
  (Furchgott method) with SABRE using unified pathway amplification (γ) and ligand
  affinity (Kd) parameters. Simulated data (symbols) for three different compounds
  (Cpd. 1, 2, and 3) and two different inactivation levels (Trt_1 and Trt_2) were
  generated in Prism as described in Methods with the parameter values as shown (three
  compounds with corresponding log Kd,is and εis, i = 1, 2, and 3 at three different
  inactivation levels with corresponding qjs, j = 0, 1, and 2; 5% random error) and
  fitted with SABRE (lines) using a total of nine parameters (Table B). Data were
  selected to illustrate that receptor inactivation can change full agonists into
  partial ones with significant change in apparent and even relative efficacies—compare
  compound 2 (red) and 1 (blue) at Trt_0 versus Trt_2.
