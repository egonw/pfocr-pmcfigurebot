figure_title: Associated immune metabolism in the tumor microenvironment
caption: Enhanced glycolysis of tumor cells resulted in an increase of lactic acid
  in the microenvironment. Abnormal amino acid metabolism increased glutamine and
  canine urine. Abnormal fatty acid metabolism will lead to more dependence of immunosuppressive
  cells on FAO pathway. The above three metabolic abnormalities will make the function
  of immune cells abnormal and the transformation of immune phenotype, conducive to
  the growth of cancer cells.
