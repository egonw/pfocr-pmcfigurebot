figure_title: Mechanism of metformin on CML CD34+ cells
caption: A Purified CML CD34+ cells were treated with metformin for 24 and 48 h and
  subjected to label-free quantitative MS analysis. Heatmap of alternation pathways
  regulated by metformin was shown. B, C Representative GSEA plots of oxidative pathway
  and glycolysis post metformin treatment 48 h. D, E OCR and ECAR of CML CD34+ cells
  in response to metformin. F GO cell compartment (CC) enrichment analysis and volcano
  plots of proteins regulated by metformin for indicated times (FC > 1.5 and P < 0.05).
  G, H RT-PCR (G, n = 3) and western blot analysis (H) of ER stress signaling of metformin
  or vehicle-treated purified CML or normal CD34+ cells. *, **, and *** indicated
  P value< 0.05, <0.005, and <0.001, respectively. I Purified CML CD34+ cells were
  treated with imatinib, tunicamycin or tunicamycin plus imatinib for 72 h. Cell apoptosis
  were measured. Representative flow cytometry plots were shown on the top. n = 4.
  ** and *** indicated P value <0.005 and <0.001 versus non-treated group, respectively.
  J GSEA plots of E2F target, G2M checkpoint, MYC target, DNA repair, and combined
  protein subset named CML stem cell targets are shown.
