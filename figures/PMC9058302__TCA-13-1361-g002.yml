caption: Effect of increasing activation factor of cGAS‐STING pathway on the radiosensitivity
  of NSCLC cells. (a) DSB induction in H460 cells by A12B4C3 and/or IR. H460 cells
  pretreated with A12B4C3 (10 μM) or DMSO were irradiated with γ‐ray (0, 2 and 4 Gy).
  After incubation with antibodies against γH2AX and Alexa Fluor 555 anti‐mouse IgG,
  the cells were counterstained with DAPI. Representative images of γH2AX foci staining
  (400 × magnification) (left panel) and quantification of γH2AX foci (right panel)
  in H460 cells are shown. (b) H460 cells pretreated with 10 μM A12B4C3 or DMSO were
  treated with IR (0, 2, and 4 Gy) and analyzed using a colony‐formation assay. Representative
  images (left panel) and quantification of colonies (right panel) are shown. (c–i)
  The mRNA levels of relevant signaling molecules in H460 cells. (c) cGAS, (d) STING,
  (e) TBK1, (f) IRF3, (g) p65, (h) BAX and (i) Caspase‐3. The data from three independent
  experiments are presented as mean ± standard deviation. *p <0.05; **p <0.01
