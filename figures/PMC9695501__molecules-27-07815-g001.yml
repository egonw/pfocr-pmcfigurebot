caption: 'Effects of RA on body weight changes and organ indices in mice with CPâˆ’induced
  ALI and AKI. The body weight, liver, kidney, and spleen of mice were weighed, their
  body weight changes (a) are presented, and their liver coefficients (b), kidney
  coefficients (c), and spleen coefficients (d) were calculated. These experiments
  were repeated three times. ** and ## denote highly significant differences (p <
  0.01) compared with the control and CP model groups, respectively.'
