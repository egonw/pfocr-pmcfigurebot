caption: The levels of m6A modifications were reduced due to the decreased expression
  of METTL3 and METTL14, which influenced the expression of PHLPP2 and mTORC2 through
  YTHDF1/2, activating AKT signaling pathway to promote the proliferation and tumorigenicity
  of tumor cells. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. AKT is a serine and threonine kinase,
  which leads to the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on target proteins.
  The growth factor binds to its ligands and activates RTK or GPCR on the cell membrane,
  so as to activate PI3K. The activated PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 and converts it into
  PIP3, which increases the level of PIP3, activates PDK1 and activates AKT. i) AKT
  phosphorylates GSK3, which is an inhibitor of glycogen synthesis, and inhibits its
  activity, resulting in the activation of GS and increasing glycogen synthesis. ii)
  AKT inhibits FOXO, which inhibits cell survival and proliferation, thereby increasing
  cell survival and proliferation. iii) AKT phosphorylates TSC1/2 and inhibits its
  negative regulation of RHEB, which is an activator of mTORC1, thereby activating
  mTORC1, resulting in the activation of P70S6K and S6 and promoting protein synthesis.
  iv) AKT activates ATP citrate lyase and promotes fatty acid synthesis. RTK, receptor
