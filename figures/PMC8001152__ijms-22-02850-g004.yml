caption: Gene heatmap enables to visualize protein expression data in a specific canonical
  pathway, across multiple analyses at one time. (A) Oxidative phosphorylation. (B)
  Sirtuin signaling pathway. (C) RhoA signaling. (D) Glycolysis I. (E) Role of PKR
  in interferon induction and antiviral response. (F) Gluconeogenesis I. (G) Necroptosis
  signaling pathway. (H) BAG2 signaling pathway. Green and red colors refer respectively
  to decrease or increase for each individual protein statistically changed in our
  proteomics dataset. Grey color indicates changes that are statistically not significant
  for p-value (ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test (p < 0.05)). Dots indicate
  non-significant values for z-score (z-score ≥ 2, ≤ −2).
