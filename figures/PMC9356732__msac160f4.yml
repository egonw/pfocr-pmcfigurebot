caption: Proportion of positively selected sites mapped on the RIG-I-like receptor
  signaling pathway from the KEGG database (; ; ). Each box represents one gene in
  the pathway and the color within the box shows the proportion of positively selected
  sites among all sites within the CDS for that particular gene. White indicates a
  value of 0, and darker shades of blue denote higher proportions. The proportion
  of selected sites was estimated from a total of 26 species of waterfowl using HyPhy
  (). Small boxes without a color indication were not included in the hybrid capture,
  usually because they were not yet annotated in the mallard genome at the beginning
  of this study.
