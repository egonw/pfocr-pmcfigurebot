caption: Immunohistochemical detection and the representative images of CIAPIN1 in
  CCA tissues (taken at a magnification of 400×). (a) The negative control of CCA
  tissue without primary antibody followed by secondary antibody. (b) Weak CIAPIN1
  staining of the normal monolayer of cholangiocytes in normal tissues adjacent to
  CCA tissue. (c) Strong cytoplasmic staining in CCA cells. (d) The expression of
  CIAPIN1 in the cancerous region was higher than in the adjacent region with statistical
  significance. (e) CIAPIN1 expression in cancerous regions of the lymph node (LN)
  metastasis group was higher than the non-metastasis group with statistical significance.
  Data were presented as mean ± SD; Mann–Whitney U test was used; *** statistically
  significant with p < 0.0001.
