caption: Higher AMES correlates with higher TMB, intra-tumor heterogeneity and DDR
  mutation frequency in BLCA. (A) The correlations among TMB, AMES, and APOBECs were
  analyzed in pan-cancer. Among all cases, AMES exhibited the highest and most significant
  correlation with TMB in BLCA (r = 0.514, p < 2.2e-16). (B) TMB, TNB, and ITH score
  were stepwisely and significantly elevated as AMES increased. (C) AMES showed highly
  positive correlations with both non-synonymous (r = 0.538, p < 0.001) and synonymous
  (r = 0.564, p < 0.001) mutations in BLCA samples. (D) FGFR3 is a mutual driver gene
  in both AMES-L and AMES-M groups, while no driver gene was detected in the AMES-H
  group. (E) FGFR3 mutation frequency descends as AMES level increases. (F) Significantly
  mutated genes were identified in the AMES-H group compared to the other two groups,
  and TTN, MACF1 and PIK3CA are the three most frequently mutated genes in AMES-H
  samples. ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. (G) A ternary diagram was plotted to depict
  the distribution of all non-silent mutations in the three AMES groups, and the 10
  most frequent non-silent mutations (TP53, TTN, KMT2D, MUC16, KDM6A, ARID1A, PIK3CA,
  SYNE1, RB1, and KMT2C) were highlighted in red dots. (H) More co-occurrence and
  mutually exclusive mutations could be observed as AMES level increased. (I) Mutation
  rates of seven DDR pathways (BER, NER, MMR, HRR, NHEJ, FA, and TLS) were summarized
  in different AMES groups, and a higher frequency of DDR pathway mutation was observed
  in the AMES-H group. (J) AMES is significantly elevated in DDR-Mut samples compared
  to DDR-WT. (K) An oncoplot shows the distribution of the 10 most frequently mutated
  DDR genes among different AMES groups.
