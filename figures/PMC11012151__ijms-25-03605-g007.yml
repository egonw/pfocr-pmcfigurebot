caption: Role of exercise-induced hormones and metabolites in the protection against
  DN. After exercise, adipose tissue releases neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) to inhibit TNF receptor
  1 (TNF-r1) in the kidney and skeletal muscle releases Irisin and Metrnl, activating
  AMPK signaling pathway and inhibiting AKT signaling pathway in the kidney. These
  effects above play an anti-inflammatory role in the kidney. In addition, exercise-induced
  release of BAIBA from the muscle activates transcription factor A mitochondria (TFAM)
  in the kidney and blocks the action of Ang II, thus promoting mitochondrial biogenesis
  in the kidney and inhibiting oxidative stress. Moreover, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)
  released from the liver after exercise can promote the accumulation of Nrf2 in the
  nucleus by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), thus reducing the damage
  to podocytes. Exercise also promotes the release of Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
  from the gut, which somehow reduces macrophage infiltration in the kidney. The mechanism
  by which these exercise-induced hormones and metabolites protect against DN needs
  further study. The question mark means that the mechanism is not yet clear. Icons
  are from ScienceSlides of Visiscienece.
