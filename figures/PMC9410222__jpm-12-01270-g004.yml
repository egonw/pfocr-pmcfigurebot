caption: (a) Map of WNT pathway-associated genes. The mutational frequencies, including
  putative driver mutations and variants of unknown significance, are indicated for
  cell lines (left) and CCA tissue samples (right). (b) Volcano plot of Nanostring®
  mRNA measurement using the human Pan Cancer pathway panel® with highlighted Kegg
  WNT-pathway hits. Comparison of the CTNNB1 mutated CC-LP-1 and the APC mutated KKU-M055
  cell line with the two WNT pathway wild-type cell lines HuCC-A1 and TKKK. (c) Heatmap
  showing pathway scores across indicated cholangiocarcinoma cell lines to illustrate
  clustering of pathways within samples. Orange indicates high pathway scores; blue
  indicates low pathway scores (with undetermined functional dimension).
