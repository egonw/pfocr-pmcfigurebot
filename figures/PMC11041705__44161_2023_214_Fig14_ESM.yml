figure_title: NAD+ treatment causes downregulation of genes enriched for functions
  related to immune responses and extracellular matrix remodelling exclusively in
  Kdm8 mutant hearts
caption: a, Percentage of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 2-month-old Kdm8fl/fl;Myh6-Cre
  mutant hearts at disease onset (total = 458 genes) and that are persistently dysregulated
  in 4-month old mutant hearts at baseline, and in response to NAD+ treatment. Left
  bars represent the percentage of DEGs that were upregulated or downregulated at
  2 months. Middle and right bars represent the percentage of those DEGs that are
  persistently dysregulated at 4 months. b, Gene ontology (GO) terms (cellular component)
  and KEGG pathways enriched amongst genes downregulated in Kdm8fl/fl control and
  Kdm8fl/fl;Myh6-Cre mutant mice at baseline and in response to NAD+ treatment. c,
  GO term (cellular component) and KEGG pathway (cellular component) enrichment amongst
  upregulated genes. Data was analyzed using g:Profiler. d, GO term (biological process)
  enrichment amongst upregulated genes. Data was analyzed using g:Profiler
