caption: 'Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of genes involved in mesenchymal-epithelial
  transformation of HepG2 (Aa), C3A (Ab), and SNU-449 (Ac) model cells after culturing
  for 24 h on C60(OH)40 nanofilm. mRNA levels were determined with real-time polymerase
  chain reaction. The bars represent the means with standard deviations (n = 4). Relative
  expression was calculated using the reference gene (GAPDH) and the non-treated group
  (value = 0). The expression is presented as log2(fold change). Values above 0 indicate
  an increase in gene expression. Values below 0 indicate a decrease in gene expression.
  Differences with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were defined as statistically significant compared
  to the control group: one asterisk (*), p-value ≤ 0.05; two asterisks (**), p-value ≤  0.01;
  three asterisks (***), p-value ≤  0.001.'
