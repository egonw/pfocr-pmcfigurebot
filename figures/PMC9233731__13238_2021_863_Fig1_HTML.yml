caption: Schematic illustration of the biogenesis of EVs and the structure of an exosome.
  (A) A representative diagram of a typical exosome and its components. In general,
  the composition of a typical exosome differs significantly; some of the constituents
  can be found in a specific set of exosomes. (B) A representative diagram showing
  the biogenesis pathway of various EVs, including exosomes, MVs, and ABs; the release
  of exosomes follows an endosomal pathway; MVs are released by budding and shedding
  off the cell membrane, and ABs are released from the apoptotic cells
