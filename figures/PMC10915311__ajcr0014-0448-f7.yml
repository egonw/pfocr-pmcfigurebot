caption: GSEA analysis revealed enriched cellular junction in NTS-low PDAC. GSE71729
  as showed in  was analyzed for NTS expression in primary pancreatic cancer specimens,
  and NTS pattern grouping was determined by its mean expression value. These NTS-high
  or -low PDACs were then analyzed with GSEA, and enriched pathways in NTS-low group
  (A) REACTOME_TIGHT_JUNCTION_INTERACTIONS (NES=-2.18; P<0.001), (B) KEGG_TIGHT_JUNCTION
  (NES=-1.88, P<0.001), and (C) REACTOME_CELL_CELL_JUNCTION_ORGANIZATION (NES=-1.73,
  P<0.001) were shown.
