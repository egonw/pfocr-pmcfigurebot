caption: The effect of PERK-eIF2α pathway activation on PDCoV replication. (A–E) The
  effect of salubrinal (A-C) or ISRIB (D, E) on PDCoV replication. LLC-PK cells were
  treated with salubrinal or ISRIB and then used in assays as described in panel B
  of . Collected samples were subjected to western blot (A, D) or quantitative real-time
  RT-PCR analysis (B, C and E) for determining the expression of N protein, relative
  ATF4 mRNA and viral genomic RNA. (F, G) LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-eIF2α
  (F) or pCAGGS-HA-eIF2αS51A (G) for 12 h and then infected with PDCoV for 12 h, before
  being used in a western blot analysis for detecting the p-eIF2α, HA-eIF2α, and PDCoV
  N protein expression as a means of evaluating viral replication. The presented results
  are the means and standard deviations of data from three independent experiments.
