caption: 'The RBP-regulated network and transcription cycle pathway of U1-lncRNAs
  correlated mRNAs. (A) GO term count of U1-lncRNAs correlated mRNAs. (B) Venn diagram
  illustrating the overlapped genes in U1-lncRNAs correlated mRNAs and RBPTD database.
  (C) RBP-target network constructed by the top 500 pairs of RBP-target in U1-lncRNAs
  correlated mRNAs. (D) Functional annotation of genes in the top 500 pairs by ClueGO.
  (E) The enrichment score of transcription cycle of tumor and normal samples in TCGA-LIHC
  dataset. T-test was used to compare enrichment scores of tumor and normal samples.
  Significance level: *** p < 0.001.'
