caption: 'Effects of KC-A on 11-ketoandrogen-induced AR signaling in C4-2, LNCaP and
  22Rv1 cells. The cells were pretreated for 2 h without or with 5 μM KC-A, and then
  cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 1 nM 11KDHT or 10 nM 11KAdione in
  the cells. (A–F) Nuclear expression of AR and AR Vs. The nuclei of the cells were
  fractionated from the cytosol by using a LysoPure Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extractor
  Kit and analyzed by immunoblotting. The protein levels are expressed as a percentage
  of the band density relative to those in the control cells treated with DMSO alone.
  ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05, NS p > 0.05 denotes significantly different from the cells
  treated with DMSO alone. ## p < 0.01 denotes significantly different from the cells
  treated with 1 nM 11KDHT or 10 nM 11KAdione alone. (G–I) Immunofluorescence staining.
  The C4-2 (G), LNCaP (H) and 22Rv1 (I) cells were stained with the anti-AR antibody
  (green) and DAPI (blue). Merged images are also shown. Scale bar indicates 10 μm.'
