caption: Illustration of the workflow. (a) Individual-based harmonic waves Ψs is calculated
  by eigen-decomposition of graph Laplacian matrix of its underlying brain network
  . (b) The global common harmonic waves  is learned by iteratively adjusting each
  Ψs and updating the manifold center on the Stiefel manifold. (c) The region-based
  individual harmonic wavelets Φs,i of node vi in brain network  is estimated by minimizing
  three energy terms, including topology preservation in red, subnetwork localization
  penalty in black, and redundancy removal in blue. (d) Finally, the region-based
  common harmonic wavelets  is obtained by learning the Fréchet mean from a population
  of {Φs,i|s = 1, ⋯, m} for node vi on the Stiefel manifold.
