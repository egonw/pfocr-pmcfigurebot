caption: Depletion of KRT80 impeded NSCLC cell migratory and invasive abilities as
  well as EMT. (a and b) The Transwell assay was conducted to measure the number of
  migrating and invaded A549 cells (Scale bar = 40 μm). (c) The Western blot assessed
  protein levels.  ∗ ∗P < 0.01 and  ∗ ∗ ∗P < 0.001. Knockdown of KRT80 inhibits TGF-β/SMAD
  signaling in NSCLC cells.
