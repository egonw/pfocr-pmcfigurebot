caption: Comparative analysis of retinoic acid pathway components in ocular tissues
  of PEX and control eyes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of (A) iris, (B) ciliary
  body, (C) retina, and (D) choroid tissue samples from unaffected donors (Control,
  n = 23) and PEX patients (n = 24) showing relative mRNA expression levels of RBP4
  (retinol binding protein 4, plasma), STRA6 (signaling receptor and transporter of
  retinol STRA6), RBP1, RBP2 (retinol binding protein, cellular), ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase),
  RDH (retinol dehydrogenase), ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase), CRABP (cellular retinoic
  acid binding protein), RAR (retinoic acid receptor), RXR (retinoid X receptor),
  and ROR (RAR related orphan receptor). Data are normalized to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase) and HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1) and expressed
  as means ±  SD relative to controls set to 1 (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001;
  unpaired t-test).
