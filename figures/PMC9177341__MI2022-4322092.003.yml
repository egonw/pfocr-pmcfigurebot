caption: Pulmonary chemokines, cytokines, and TLR/MyD88 signal of IL-21R−/− mice in
  response to Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) lung infection. Following C. muridarum
  infection, mice were euthanized at days 0, 3, 7, and 14 and lungs were harvested
  for mRNA expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted from pulmonary tissues of
  wild-type (WT) and IL-21 receptor deficient (IL-21R−/−) mice, and the mRNA expression
  of chemotactic factors (a–f) KC, MIP-2, CXCR2, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α as well as
  (g–j) TLR/MyD88/NF-κB pathway mediators TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, and p65 was measured
  by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Data are represented as means ± SD from n
  = 3–4 per group, representative one of three independent experiments. Statistical
  significances of differences are determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's
  multiple comparisons test. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
