caption: Expression patterns of marker genes of PPE and bmps in lmo4a morphants and
  rescue of deficiencies in lmo4a morphants via blockage of Bmp signaling. All panels
  represent lateral views. (A) Expressions of eya1 in WT embryos at 10 hpf. (B) Expressions
  of eya1 in lmo4a MO embryos were decreased. (C) Bmp4 was expressed strongly at the
  anterior and posterior ends but weakly in the lateral and dorsal regions of the
  vesicle in the control group at 28 hpf. (D) Ectopic expression of bmp4 was observed
  in the dorsal region, with extended original anterior and posterior regions of expression
  in lmo4a morphants at 28 hpf. (E) bmp2b was expressed strongly at the anterior,
  posterior and ventral regions in the control group at 36 hpf. (F) Dispersed distribution
  of bmp2b throughout the vesicle in lmo4a morphants at 36 hpf. (G,H) Chordin (chd)
  morpholino could replicate the lmo4a MO phenotype with immature protrusions to an
  extent. (I,J) Heat shock of tBR at 22 hpf successfully rescued the semicircular
  canal phenotype of lmo4a MO. (K,L) DM knockdown of Bmp at 22 hpf achieved rescue,
  but to a lower extent. (Mâ€“P) Rescue was achieved by injecting lmo4a mRNA at the
  two-cell stage in lmo4a morphants.
