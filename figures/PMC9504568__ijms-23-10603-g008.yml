caption: Effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on anti-PEDV effects of IFN-α in IPEC-J2 cells. Sub-confluent
  cells were incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 nM) for 24 h, after which recombinant
  swine IFNα (1 μg/mL) was supplemented, and then the cells were cultured for further
  24 h. Finally, the cells were collected for RT-qPCR analysis (A) and Western blotting
  analysis (B). Sub-confluent cells were incubated IFN-α (1 μg/mL) alone or with 1,25(OH)2D3
  (20 nM) for 24 h, and then the cells were infected with PEDV and incubated for further
  24 h. Finally, the cells were collected for RT-qPCR analysis (C). * p < 0.05.
