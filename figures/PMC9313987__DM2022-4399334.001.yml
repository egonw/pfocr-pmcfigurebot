caption: The construction of drug-compound-target-disease network and PPI network.
  (a) Venn diagram displays the overlap between the prostate cancer-related targets
  and the potential targets of EF. (b) The construction of drug-compound-target-disease
  network. The orange rhombus represents diseases. The blue hexagon represents drugs.
  The purple ovals represent active compounds. The yellow rectangles represent target
  genes. (c) PPI network of 141 target genes of E&P. Each node represents the E&P
  targets. Each line represents the interaction between two targets. (d) The top 30
  enriched targets in the PPI network were displayed in a barplot.
