caption: IQGAP2 regulated EMT via activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. (A) KEGG pathway
  analysis (http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/ accessed on 29 November 2021) of IQGAP2 and
  its co-expressed genes in bladder cancer identified by cBioPortal co-expression
  analysis using bladder cancer TCGA dataset (www.cbioportal.org accessed on 29 November
  2021). (B,C) Western blot showing elevated phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 in
  TCCSUP and T24 after IQGAP2 knockdown. (D) Western blot showing decreased phospho-MEK1/2
  and phospho-ERK1/2 in T24 after IQGAP2 overexpression. (E) Western blot showing
  rescue of phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 in T24_IQGAP2_EX with IQGAP2 depletion
  compared with control. (F) Western blot showing rescued phospho-ERK after treating
  IQGAP2-depleted (IQGAP2_KD) T24 with phospho-ERK inhibitor U0126. (G) Cell invasion
  assay after treating IQGAP2-depleted (IQGAP2_KD) T24 with phospho-ERK inhibitor
  U0126. Bar chart presents the means of replicates ± SEM from three different experiments;
  Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unpaired) was used for comparison of means.
