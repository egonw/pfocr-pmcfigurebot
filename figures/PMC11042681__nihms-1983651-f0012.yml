figure_title: Human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells present an extensive overlap in the
  innate immune response to IL-1β and IFN-α (related to  and )
caption: 'a, Diagram representation of the upregulated (red), downregulated (blue),
  and unchanged genes (black) in EndoC-βH1 cells treated with IL-1β and IFN-α compared
  to PBS. Statistical analyses were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
  and genes were filtered for FDR<0.05. b, Pathway enrichment analyses of upregulated
  and downregulated genes in EndoC-βH1 cells treated with IL-1β and IFN-α compared
  to PBS. c, Venn diagram representation of the commonly upregulated (red), downregulated
  (blue), and unchanged genes (black) of the intersected genes in EndoC-βH1 and human
  islets cells treated with IL-1β and IFN-α compared to PBS. Statistical analyses
  were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and genes were filtered for
  FDR<0.05. d, Pathway enrichment analyses of commonly upregulated and downregulated
  genes in human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells treated with IL-1β and IFN-α compared
  to PBS. e-f, Volcano-plot representation of differentially expressed genes in human
  islets (e) and EndoC-βH1 cells (f) treated with IL-1β and IFN-α compared to PBS.
  Innate immune genes are depicted in red and show a near absolute overlap between
  human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells. Human islets: n = 15 biologically independent
  samples. EndoC-βH1 cells: n = 6 independent experiments/group. Statistical analyses
  were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. P values of pathway enrichment
  analysis were calculated according to the hypergeometric test based on the number
  of physical entities present in both the predefined set and user-specified list
  of physical entities. Source numerical data are available in source data.'
