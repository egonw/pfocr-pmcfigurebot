figure_title: Effects of adiponectin on cell viability and intracellular lipid content
  in chicken myoblasts
caption: (A) Cell viability of myoblasts. (B) TG (triglyceride) and TCH (total cholesterol)
  in chicken myoblasts were detected by triglyceride reagent kit and total cholesterol
  reagent kit respectively. (C) Oil Red O staining of lipid droplets photographed
  at 400× magnification. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *P<0.05; n = 6 in each
  group.
