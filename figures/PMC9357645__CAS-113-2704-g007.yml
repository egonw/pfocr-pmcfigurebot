caption: CD73 activates MAPK signaling pathway. A, B, Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) plots showing that “pathway in cancer” and “MAPK signaling pathway” were
  highly enriched in the NT5E_high groups. C, Heatmap showing the expression of genes
  in the MAPK signaling pathway in the NT5E_high and NT5E_low groups. D, E, Western
  blot analysis of the expression of markers in the MAPK signaling pathway in CAL27
  and HN4 cells transfected with si‐NC and si‐CD73. F, G, Western blot detecting the
  expression of markers in the MAPK signaling pathway in CAL27 and HN4 cells with
  combined treatment of CD73 knockdown and LM22B
article_title: CD73 facilitates invadopodia formation and boosts malignancy of head
  and neck squamous cell carcinoma via the MAPK signaling pathway.
