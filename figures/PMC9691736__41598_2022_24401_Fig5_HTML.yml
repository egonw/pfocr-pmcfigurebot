caption: (A) Bulk placental RNA-sequencing suggests prenatal THC exposure is associated
  with a clear gene expression signature. RNA-sequencing of rhesus macaque placental
  tissue at gestational day 155. Heatmap of hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially
  expressed genes of control (left, n = 5) and THC-exposed (right, n = 5) placental
  samples. (B) RNA seq pathway analysis. Top significant terms in the Gene Ontology
  (GO) enrichment analysis of control versus THC-exposed placentas suggest prenatal
  THC exposure is associated with dysregulated placental vascular development and
  intracellular signaling, involved in angiogenesis.
