caption: PPI induced autophagy via AKT/mTOR pathway in SW480 cells. (A) AKT/mTOR pathway-related
  proteins were examined by Western blot assay after treatment with PPI for 12 and
  24 h, respectively; (B) the quantification of p-mTOR/mTOR and p-AKT/AKT, respectively.
  n = 3, the data are presented as means Â± SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
