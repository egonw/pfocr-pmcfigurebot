caption: 'A Enrichment analyses of KEGG genetic, immune, and signaling pathways for
  each of the 84 perturbed genes, stratified by gene module. The JAK-STAT pathway
  is highlighted with a dashed-red box. B The JAK-STAT sub-network, which is organized
  such that cytokine genes are at the bottom and upstream regulators are at the top.
  C Effects of knock outs in the gene modules on a proliferation assay. Each point
  represents an individual gene perturbation sample plotted as the log2 fold change
  sample count as compared to AAVS1 KO control samples from the same donor. (*: p-value
  < 0.05, **** p-value < 0.001; n=3 donors per KO, the number of KOs per cluster is
  reflected in ).'
