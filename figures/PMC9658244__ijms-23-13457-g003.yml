caption: Mechanistic insights on the cellular and molecular players involved in the
  effect of IL-33/ST2 pathway, following the sequestration of iRBC in the vasculature
  of the BBB. IRBCs bind to ICAM-1 at the surface of endothelial cells via the Plasmodium
  erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). IRBCs may also release IL-33 (yellow circles)
  that can activate ICAM-1 expression on EC promoting the binding of iRBC. Histones
  (green circles) released by iRBC may synergize with IL-33. IL-33 drives the expansion
  of ILC2 cells, leading to the polarization of the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages,
  which in turn expand Tregs giving a beneficial role of the IL-33/ST2 pathway in
  ECM. IL-33 may also have detrimental activities by inducing vascular permeablity
  responsible for œdema and targeting cells involved in the integrity of BBB, such
  as microglia which can then produce IL-1β resulting in neuroinflammation and IL-33
  overexpression in oligodendrocytes. Autophagy pathways participate in the neuropathophysiological
  mechanisms of CM in driving the transfer of PbA-microvesicles (PbA-MVs-grey circle)
  and the induction the proinflammatory response in astrocytes. This pathway could
  also involve the IL-33/ST2 activity.
