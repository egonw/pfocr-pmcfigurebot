caption: 'ICS II attenuated insulin resistance in db/db mice by regulating the IRS1/Akt
  signaling transduction pathway. (a) Representative western blot of phosphorylation
  level of IRTyr 1185 and quantitation of phosphorylation level of IRTyr 1185 in the
  liver (n = 5). (b) Representative western blot of phosphorylation level of IRS1Ser
  307 and quantitation of phosphorylation level of IRS1Ser 307 in the liver (n = 5).
  (c) Representative western blot of phosphorylation level of Akt and quantitation
  of phosphorylation level of Akt in the liver (n = 5). (d) Representative western
  blot of phosphorylation level of GSK3βSer 9 and quantitation of phosphorylation
  level of GSK3βSer 9 in the liver (n = 5). (e) Representative western blot of cell
  surface and total GLUT4, and quantitation of cell surface GLUT4 content in the liver
  (n = 5). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01 versus WT group; #p < 0.05
  and ##p < 0.01 versus db/db group.'
