caption: Functional enrichment analysis of the top 10 hub genes targeted by three
  miRNA clusters. a GO-BP (biological processes) enrichment, b GO-MF (Molecular functions)
  enrichment, c GO-CC (Cellular Component) enrichment, and d signaling pathway analysis
  was shown. The visual representation of functional enrichment analysis generated
  through GOPlot, a package of R
