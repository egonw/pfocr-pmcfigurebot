caption: '(A–C) Drug intervention in the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway; groups not
  treated with drugs served as the control group. Protein expression of RhoA, ROCK2,
  CDC42, OCN, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) on various pore
  morphologies by Western blotting with or without small-molecule drug (RhoA inhibitor-
  CCG1432, ROCK2 inhibitor- Y27632) intervention. (D) The osteogenesis-associated
  Runx2 and migration-associated CDC42 protein levels on various pore morphologies
  for 7 days, with or without RhoA and ROCK2 inhibitor intervention, was measured
  by ELISA, (n = 4, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). (E) Summary of mechanism:
  Pore morphology affects BMSCs osteogenic differentiation and migration via the RhoA/ROCK2
  signaling pathway.'
