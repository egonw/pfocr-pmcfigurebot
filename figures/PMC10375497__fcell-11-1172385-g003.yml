caption: Transcriptome changes between iPSCs and P-iPSCs. (A) Principal component
  analysis of HEF, P-HAF, hESCs, iPSCs, and P-iPSCs. (B) DEGs of iPSCs and P-iPSCs.
  (C) GO analysis of the DEGs comparing iPSCs and P-iPSCs. (D) KEGG pathway analysis
  comparing iPSCs and P-iPSCs. (E) DEGs (|log2 (fold change)| > 1, FDR< 0.05) related
  to the cell cycle are shown in the heatmap. (F) Heatmap showing the expression of
  marker genes in HEF, P-HAF, iPSCs, P-iPSCs, and hESCs. (G) GSEA showing enriched
  GO-BP terms for up- and downregulated DEGs, respectively. (H) DEGs (|log2 (fold
  change)| > 1, FDR< 0.05) related to the Wnt signaling pathway are shown in the heatmap.
  (I) Network of candidate targets in the Wnt signaling pathway.
