caption: 'Deficiency of miR-7a2 in the ovary impairs ovarian function. (A) The estrus
  cycle of transplanted mice was determined by a vaginal smear for 18 consecutive
  days, comprising dioestrus, proestrus, estrus, and metestrus represented by D, P,
  E, and M, respectively; n = 6. (B) Ovary-transplanted mice were separately mated
  with WT male mice for three weeks, and the litter sizes were recorded; n = 6. (C)
  Macro-observation of ovaries from “WT + WT Ovary” mice and “WT + KO Ovary” mice.
  (D) Sections of ovary-transplanted mice were observed by H.E. staining; PMF: primodial
  follicle; PF: primary follicle; SF: secondary follicle; SAF: small antral follicle;
  LAF: large antral follicle; CL: corpus luteum; AT: atretica. Bars: 50 μm. (E–G)
  RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of synthase Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1, and 17β-HSD
  at the mRNA level in the ovaries of ovarian transplanted mice. (H) Detection of
  estrogen levels in the serum of ovarian transplanted mice. Data are presented as
  mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01. NS, not significant.'
