caption: Overexpression of exogenous EML4–ALK changed HLA–I expression. (a) Exogenous
  EML4 ‐ ALK (V1) was successfully expressed in Beas ‐ 2B cells and activated the
  MAPK pathway. Similarly, these effects can be reduced by ALK inhibitors. (b) After
  72 h treatment with ALK inhibitors TAE684 or crizotinib (1 μM), flow cytometry analysis
  showed that HLA ‐I expression levels were also upregulated

  ALK fusion.
