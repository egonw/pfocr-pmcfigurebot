caption: KEGG pathway of the pyrimidine metabolism annotated with C. variabilis NC64A
  and PBCV-1 genes and comprehensive “roadway” predictions. C. variabilis NC64A genes
  are colored green, and PBCV-1 genes are red. This figure summarizes the virus-mediated
  metabolic fluxes where viral genes either (i) complement the pathway by providing
  a function not identified in the host genome, and we refer to this as a “roadway
  by-pass” (indicated by a blue arrow); or (ii) augment the pathway by providing a
  function that is present in the host genome, and we refer to this as a “roadway
  passing lane” (indicated by a yellow arrow). Metabolite-directed flux rates of virus-encoded
  enzymes are sensitive to either positive feedback regulators (indicated by a red
  solid line with a plus sign “+”) or negative feedback regulators (indicated by a
  red dashed line with a minus sign “−”).
