caption: Depletion of SSS leads to the functional decline of the Drosophila gut. (A
  and B) Representative images (A) and quantification (B) of the percentage of intestinal
  acid–base homeostasis of the WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies. The circle shows the CCR
  area. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. (C) Representative
  images (left) and quantification (right) of fly excretions from the WT and sss P1/sss
  Δ40 flies fed with Bromophenol Blue. Mean and SD. (D) Measurements of food consumption
  of the WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies through a colorimetric estimation after the treatment
  with non‐absorbed blue dye. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments.
  (E) Representative images (left) and quantification (right) of the percentage of
  ‘Smurf’ flies in WT and sss P1/sss Δ40 flies. Drosophila with and without blue dye
  visible outside the digestive tract were recorded as Smurf (+) and Smurf (−) flies,
  respectively. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. WT = wild
  type. Student's t test, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
