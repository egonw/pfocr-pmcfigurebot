caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between
  the control and noise exposure groups. The x-axis represents the enrichment factor
  for each of the differentially expressed genes in each pathway. The y-axis shows
  the name of the enriched pathway. The size of each node represents the number of
  enriched genes in that pathway, and the p.adjust values are indicated by changing
  colors, moving from red to blue.
