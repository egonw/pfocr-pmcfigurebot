caption: 'Cell communication analysis. A Left panel: number of ligand-receptor pairs,
  right panel: intensity of combined ligand-receptor pairs. B Diagram showing how
  thyroid cells communicate with other cells. C A network diagram showing how the
  MIF signaling pathway communicates with other cells. D Bubble plots show ligand
  receptor pairs involved in communication between various cell types, with the size
  and color of the bubbles reflecting the P-value and the strength of communication'
article_title: Prognostic subtypes of thyroid cancer was constructed based on single
  cell and bulk-RNA sequencing data and verified its authenticity.
