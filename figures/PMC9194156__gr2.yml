caption: Cross-talk between immune cell and cancer cellIn the TME, an innate immune
  cell such as macrophage leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines that can
  promote cancer (top panel). Tumor-associated antigens, which act as pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern (PAMP) or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), can activate
  TLR or IL-1R in macrophage (; ). After activation, TLR recruits MyD88 through an
  adapter protein, TIRAP (or MAL, MyD88 adaptor-like), activating the IRAKs/TRAF6
  signaling (bottom panel). IL-1R can directly recruit MyD88 without the adapter protein.
  The IRAKs/TRAF6 complex promotes the activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1, a.k.a, MAP3K5) or TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase 1), leading to the activation
  of transcription factors, NF-κB, and AP-1 (activator protein 1). These transcription
  factors target the genes to produce the proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β,
  IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. Both ASK1 and TAK1 activate the MAPK signaling pathway targeting
  AP-1. TAK1 also activates the IKK (IκB kinase) complex composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and
  IKKγ (a.k.a. NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator) leading to the activation of NF-κB.
  AP-1 and NF-κB are also known to contribute to tumor developments including cell
  cycle regulation, growth, survival, chemokine, and adhesion molecule production
  for cell migration and apoptosis.
