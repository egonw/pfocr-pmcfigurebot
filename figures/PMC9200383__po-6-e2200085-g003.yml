caption: Detailed HRR pathway gene alterations per cancer type. (A) For each cancer
  type and HRR pathway gene, the percentage of samples with gene mutation detected
  and with LOH detected are annotated using size and color. The product of these two
  values is input to hierarchical clustering to generate the resulting type-gene ordering.
  Cancer types annotated with a + mark are BRCA-associated cancers, and values indicate
  the number of cases in TCGA. (B) Types and proportions of biallelic HRR pathway
  gene alterations per cancer type. (C) Correlation between the TP53 mutation ratio
  with mean HRD score (left) and mean Sig3 ratio (right) by cancer type. Upper and
  lower panels are from the TCGA data sets and data sets in the study by Jonsson et
  al, respectively. Colors are identical to panel B or otherwise gray. rS and P represent
  the Spearman correlation coefficient and its P value, respectively. HRD, homologous
  recombination deficiency; HRR, homologous recombination repair; LOH, loss of heterozygosity;
  MSI, microsatellite instability; Sig3, mutational signature 3; TCGA, The Cancer
  Genome Atlas.
