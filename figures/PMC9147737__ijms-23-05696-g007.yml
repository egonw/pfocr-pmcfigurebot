caption: Functional analysis of tobacco lines overexpressing PdTHC2’GT, PdCHS, and
  PdCHI. (a) Phenotypic characterization of tobacco flowers between the wildtype group
  and transgenic lines. (b) After overexpression of PdTHC2’GT, the expression quantity
  of NtCHS in tobacco flowers changed. (c) After overexpression of PdTHC2’GT, the
  expression quantity of NtCHI in tobacco flowers changed. (d) After overexpression
  of PdCHS, the expression quantity of NtCHI in tobacco flowers changed. (e) After
  overexpression of PdCHI, the expression quantity of NtCHS in tobacco flowers changed.
  (f) Heatmap analysis of anthocyanin component. (g) Heatmap analysis of flavonoids
  component. The contents of (f,g) were log-transformed and used to generate a heatmap
  with the TBtools software package (v0.66443, Ziping Yang, Guangdong, China, open
  resources). The asterisks denote significant differences according to a one−way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA) (** p < 0.01).
