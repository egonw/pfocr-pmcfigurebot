caption: 'Increased conjugated BAs were associated with the elevated abundance of
  LPS‐producing bacteria. A) Concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in human gastric
  juice from control, BRG, and GC groups. B) Concentrations of LPS in human gastric
  juice from control, BRG, and GC groups. C) Elevated species in gastric juice of
  BRG group based on the LEfSe analysis between BRG and control groups. The species
  marked with asterisks are those with LPS biosynthesis function in the metagenomic
  analysis. D) Elevated species in gastric juice of GC group based on the LEfSe analysis
  between GC and control groups. The species marked with asterisks are those with
  LPS biosynthesis function in the metagenomic analysis. E) Relative abundance of
  the 5 LPS‐producing species elevated in both BRG and GC groups. F) Relative abundance
  of the LPS biosynthesis pathway in human gastric microbiota based on metagenomic
  analysis. G) Heatmaps of Spearman correlation coefficients of 8 elevated conjugated
  BAs and Prevotella melaninogenica in human gastric juice. The color of the cells
  indicates the Spearman correlation coefficients (r). Data are shown as mean with
  SEM. Differences between groups were assessed using the Kruskal‐Wallis test, #p
  < 0.005, *p < 0.05. BRG: bile reflux gastritis; GC: gastric cancer; LEfSe: linear
  discriminant analysis effect size; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; TDCA: taurodeoxycholic
  acid; GDCA: glycodeoxycholic acid; GCA: glycocholic acid; GCDCA: glycochenodeoxycholic
  acid; TCA: taurocholic acid; GUDCA: glycoursodeoxycholic acid; TUDCA: tauroursodeoxycholic
  acid; TCDCA: taurochenodeoxycholic acid.'
