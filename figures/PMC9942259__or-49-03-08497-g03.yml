caption: β-catenin mediates breast cancer development induced by LAPTM5. (A) Nuclear
  and total protein expression of β-catenin were detected by western blotting. Histone
  H3 was used as a loading control for the nucleoplasm protein. β-actin was used as
  a loading control for the total protein. (B) The location and activation of β-catenin
  was revealed by immunofluorescence. Scale bar, 50 µm. (C) The inhibition efficiency
  of β-catenin in the T-47D cells was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and western blotting. (D) Cell proliferation affected by overexpressed LAPTM5
  and si-β-catenin was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (E) The effect of si-β-catenin
  on LAPTM5 induced cell migration was revealed by wound healing assay. The relative
  migration ratio was statistically analyzed. Scale bar, 200 µm. (F) The effect of
  si-β-catenin on LAPTM5 induced cell invasion was detected by Transwell assay. Invasive
  cell number was statistically analyzed. Scale bar, 100 µm. Data originated from
  three independent experiments and are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01.
  LAPTM5, lysosomal protein transmembrane 5; si-, small interfering; OE, overexpressing;
  ns, not significant; NC, negative control.
