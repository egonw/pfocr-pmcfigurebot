caption: 'ASP inhibited the malignant characteristics of U251 cells. (a) Cell viability
  was measured by CCK-8 assay; (b) cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry;
  (c) cell migration was measured by wound healing assay; (d) cell invasion was measured
  by Transwell assay. U251 cells were treated with different concentrations of ASP
  (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL) for 48 h; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control;
  #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001 vs. 0.1 mg/mL ASP; &&P < 0.01, &&&P < 0.001vs. 0.2 mg/mL
  ASP. ASP upregulates miR-373-3p and blocks the TGF-β/Smad4 signaling pathway in
  glioma cells.'
