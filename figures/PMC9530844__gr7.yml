caption: Gab1, Grb2, Shc, and Shp2 adaptors mediate candidalysin-induced signaling
  events that trigger oral epithelial cytokine responses. C. albicans infections are
  initiated by increased fungal burden, associated hypha formation, and secretion
  of the pore-forming toxin candidalysin (Clys). When accumulated at high concentrations,
  Clys interacts with an epithelial cell membrane to form pore-like structures that
  result in membrane damage, alarmin release, and calcium influx. These events lead
  to activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the cleavage/release of epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands. EGFR activation leads to the recruitment
  and activation of the Gab1, Grb2, Shc, Shp2, and c-Cbl adaptor proteins which in
  turn mediate MKP1/DUSP1 and c-Fos activation via the MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
  Cumulatively, this leads to induction of GM-CSF and G-CSF, as well as IL-6, IL-1α,
  and IL-1β, which mediate the subsequent stages of the innate and adaptive immune
  responses. Figure created with Biorender.com
