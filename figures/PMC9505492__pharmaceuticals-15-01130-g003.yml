caption: 'MgIG modifies HRZE-induced gut microbiota composition. (a,b) Species composition
  analysis at the genus level. Compared with the control group: * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, and *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. Compared with the HRZE group. The Line
  Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis. (c) Cladogram and (d)
  LDA value distribution histogram (p < 0.05, LDA > 3). Lactobacillus was the only
  probiotic that was down-regulated by HRZE and recovered by MgIG. (e) Spearman’s
  correlation analysis heatmap at the genus level (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01). The
  data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 6). Abbreviations: C, control group;
  H, HRZE group; HMg, HRZE + MgIG group.'
