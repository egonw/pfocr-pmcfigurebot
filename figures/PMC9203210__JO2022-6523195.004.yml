caption: 'CHRM1 mediates autophagy to regulate the migration and invasion in PCa.
  (a) Wound-healing assay was established in 4 groups to detect PC-3 migration ability
  in three different periods (0, 12, and 24 h). The images were taken at a magnification
  of 40x. (b) Data from wound-healing assay using ImageJ for statistics, migration
  rate% = (Area 0 HR − Area XHR)/Area 0 h%. Each sample was run in triplicate. (c)
  Images of cell migration and invasion assays of the four tumor cell lines upon CAR,
  PIN, 3-MA, 3-MA + CAR, or 3-MA + PIN administration. The images were taken at a
  magnification of 400x. Scale bar: 1 mm. (d-g) Quantification of migrated (invaded)
  cell numbers in the cell migration (invasion) assays. Cells were counted in five
  random fields per section. ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
