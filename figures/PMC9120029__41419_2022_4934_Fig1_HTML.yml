figure_title: Mice treated with rotenone showed PD-like pathological changes and motor
  dysfunction
caption: A, B Number of TH-positive cells in the brain tissue of PD model mice treated
  with rotenone; scale bars, 500 μm (n = 4). C, D Western blot analysis of the TH
  protein levels in the SN of PD model mice treated with rotenone (n = 4). E–N Pole-climbing
  test E, F, field test (G–J) and step measurement K–N were performed on PD model
  mice treated with rotenone to evaluate the exercise ability (n = 8). Data are presented
  as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
