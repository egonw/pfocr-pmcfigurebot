figure_title: Tissue-specific expression profile of target genes and RNA in situ hybridization
caption: '(A-B) Tissue-specific expression patterns of SLC2A1 (A) and GLIS2 (B) with
  5-day-old females. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM from five biological replicates.
  The lowercase letters above bars indicate significant differences by one-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. (C-D) RNA-FISH detection of miR-275/miR-305
  (Red) and SLC2A1/GLIS2 (Green) in the fat body (C) and gut (D) of wild-type flies.
  The images were visualized using Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope
  (Zeiss, Germany) at a magnification of 40 x. Scale bar: 50 μm.'
article_title: miR-275/305 cluster is essential for maintaining energy metabolic homeostasis
  by the insulin signaling pathway in Bactrocera dorsalis.
