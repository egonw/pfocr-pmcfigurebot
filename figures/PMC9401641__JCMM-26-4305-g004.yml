caption: HUWE‐1 interacted with BMI1, and modulated BMI1 ubiquitination level and
  protein stability under the regulation of EGFR/JNK pathway. (A) A549 cells were
  treated with EGF (100 ng/ml, 24 h) or MG132 (10 μg/ml, 5 h) and detected for BMI1
  expression by Western blot. (B) A549 cells transduced with the SC, shTRIM21, shHUWE1
  or shUBR4 vectors were detected for BMI1 expression by Western blot (left), and
  the knockdown efficiencies were verified by Q‐PCR analysis (middle). Knockdown efficiency
  of shHUWE1 was also confirmed by Western blot (right). (C) A549 cells were transduced
  with Ctrl or BMI1‐HA vector (left), and the BMI1‐HA protein complex was precipitated
  from cell lysate by HA antibody, and analysed for HUWE1 expression by Western blot
  (right). (D) A549 cells were transduced with Ctrl or BMI1‐HA or shBMI1 vector (left),
  and the HUWE1 protein complex was precipitated from cell lysate by HUWE1 antibody,
  and analysed for BMI1 expression by Western blot (right). (E) A549 cells were transduced
  with Ctrl or BMI1‐HA, Flag‐Ubi or both BMI1‐HA and Flag‐Ubi vectors (left), and
  the BMI1 protein was precipitated from cell lysate by HA antibody, and analysed
  for the poly‐ubiquitination level of BMI1 by flag antibody (right). (F) A549 cells
  were transduced with Ctrl or BMI1‐HA and Flag‐Ubi, SC or shHUWE1 vectors (left),
  and the BMI1 protein was precipitated from cell lysate by HA antibody, and analysed
  for the poly‐ubiquitination level of BMI1 by flag antibody (right). (G) A549 cells
  were transduced with Ctrl or BMI1‐HA and Flag‐Ubi vectors and treated with EGF (left),
  and the BMI1 protein was precipitated from cell lysate by HA antibody, and analysed
  for the poly‐ubiquitination level of BMI1 by flag antibody (right). (H) A549 cells
  were transduced with Ctrl or BMI1‐HA and Flag‐Ubi, SC or shJNK1 + 2 vectors and
  treated with EGF (left), and the BMI1 protein was precipitated from cell lysate
  by HA antibody and analysed for the poly‐ubiquitination level of BMI1 by flag antibody
  (right). The ubiquitin signals (E–H) were quantified using ImageJ, and the relative
  intensities were indicated below the blotting. Ctrl, the control vector that expressed
  RFP; BMI1‐HA, the expression vector of BMI1 and HA‐tag fusion protein; Flag‐Ubi,
  the expression vector of Ubiquitin and Flag‐tag fusion protein; shHUWE1, the shRNA
  targeting HUWE1. * (for E to H) indicates the location of poly‐ubiquitinations.
  MG132 (10 μg/ml, 5 h) was used to stabilize the poly‐ubiquitinated proteins for
  co‐IP experiments
