caption: (A) Relative expression of metabolic and putative NR biosynthesis and structural
  genes in SQSi lines’ background. Plant phenotypes for controls and SQS lines, RT-PCR
  for the isoprenoid pathway, and natural rubber biosynthesis-associated genes. (B)
  Quantitative expression of isoprenoid biosynthesis genes. Expression levels in stem
  tissue were compared to WT and normalized to the 18S reference gene. Values are
  averages of three biological replicates +/− SD; (a) indicates a significant difference
  in comparison to WT at p > 0.05. HMGR = 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase;
  FPPS = farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; SQS = squalene synthase; CPT = cis-prenyltransferase;
  SRPP = small rubber particle protein; CBP = CPT binding protein.
