caption: 'SIRT3 is indispensable for SAL-mediated promotion of mitophagy. A qPCR shows
  the mRNA levels of SIRT3, 4 and 5 in SH-SY5Y cells treated with or without SAL.
  B Immunoblotting shows the levels of indicated proteins in SH-SY5Y cell treated
  by SAL with each indicated concentration. GAPDH as a loading control. C IF shows
  the colocalization of LC3-GFP and TOM20 in somata of SH-SY5Y cells with SIRT3 KD.
  Images in rectangles are amplified shown in lower panels. D As in C, except images
  of neurites are shown. Arrows indicate co-labeled yellow puncta. E Quantification
  shows the number of puncta co-labeled with LC3 and TOM20 in somata. F, G As in C,
  D, except SIRT3flox/flox cortical neurons transduced with AAV particles encoding
  mitoGFP and Cre were used and indicated as SIRT3 KO (see Additional file : Fig.
  S5). H As in E, except SIRT3 KO cortical neurons were used. Error bars indicates
  mean ± SD from at least 20 cells/neurites from 3 independent experiments (n ≥ 20).
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n.s., not significant; one-way ANOVA test.
