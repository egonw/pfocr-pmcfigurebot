caption: RSV induces phospho-Ser536 RELA binding to OGG1. (A) Co-immunoprecipitation
  (Co-IP) experiments. hSAECs lysates from mock- or RSV-infected cells were IPed with
  anti-OGG1 antibody. The immune complexes were fractionated and subjected to IB with
  anti-RELA. Arrowhead shows the 65 kDa RELA. (B) Co-IP of mock- or RSV-infected cells
  with anti-RELA Ab. Immune complexes were fractionated and subjected to IB with anti-OGG1.
  Arrowhead indicates the 50 kDa OGG1. (C) Lysates were prepared from FLAG-M2-OGG1-expressing
  A549 cells after various times of RSV infection and IPed with anti-FLAG M2 beads.
  Top panel, immune complexes were stained with anti-phospho-Ser536 RELA. The blot
  was stripped and re-probed to confirm equivalent levels of FLAG-OGG1 capture. Bottom
  panels are input showing total RELA and b actin. Molecular-weight markers are kDa
  (kD).
