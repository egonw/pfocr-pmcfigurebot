caption: 'Detection on the expressions of the PI3K/AKT pathway. (a) The western blot
  assay to reveal the expressions of PDGFB, PDGFRβ, p-PDGFR β, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT,
  and p-AKT. (b) Semiquantitative analysis was performed based on the gray value.
  GAPDH was used for the endogenous protein. ##compared with UUO, P < 0.01.'
