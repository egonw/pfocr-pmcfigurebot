caption: Go functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (a) GO function enrichment
  bubble chart of safflower in the treatment of CHD. (b) KEGG pathway analyses for
  the molecular signal pathway of safflower in the treatment of CHD. The node size
  represents the number of target genes enriched, and the node color from blue to
  red represents the P value from large to small. (c) FoxO signaling pathway. The
  targets associated with the core component-target-pathway network are represented
  by green rectangles.
