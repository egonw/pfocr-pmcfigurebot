caption: 'Overexpression of RECQL4 abolished the effect of TRIM58 overexpression in
  CRC cells. SW620 cells were transduced with TRIM58 and/or RECQL4 expression vector.
  A Cell viability was measured using CCK-8 assay. B, C Cell cycle was measured through
  flow cytometry. D Protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, p21, and cyclin D1 were measured
  through Western blotting. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 vs. oeNC. #p < 0.05, ###p < 0.001
  vs. oeTRIM58'
article_title: TRIM58 functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by promoting
  RECQL4 ubiquitination to inhibit the AKT signaling pathway.
