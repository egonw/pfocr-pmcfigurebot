caption: Modulation of signal transduction through the cholinergic system by OP exposure.
  Exposure to OPs induces AChE inhibition and ACh accumulation, leading to AChR overstimulation.
  (a) The overactivation of nAChRs and mAChRs leads to increased Ca2+ influx, which
  in turn induces increased ROS in mitochondria. (b) Increased intracellular Ca2+
  induces activation of p38-MAPK and ERK signaling promoting an inflammatory stage
  through NF-KB the activation and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (TNF-alpha and IL-6). In addition, intracellular Ca2+signaling evokes the up-regulation
  of c-fos expression and IL-2-induced signal transduction in T and B cells, triggering
  inflammatory responses. (c) OPs cause the inhibition of phospholipase C and decreased
  CREB phosphorylation and cAMP levels. Reduced CREB phosphorylation promotes NF-κB
  activation and leads to the degradation of IκB, which allows the release of NF-κB
  and facilitates its nuclear translocation, where it promotes the transcription of
  genes involved in pro-inflammatory immune responses. (d) The OP metabolite (DEDTP)
  promotes the phosphorylation of SOCS3 and the dephosphorylation of STAT5 protein,
  and leads to the activation of p21, resulting in T-cell arrest. (e) DEDTP also induced
  the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38, resulting in the assembly of AP1, ELK,1,
  and NFAT, which are the major transcription factors involved in the IL-2 autocrine
  pathway.
