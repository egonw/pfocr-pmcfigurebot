caption: Effect of T‐2 on the expression of genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway in
  grapes. (a) Relative gene expression levels of Vv‐phenylpropanoid ammonia‐lyase
  (Vv‐PAL). The horizontal axis is the storage days after inoculation, the vertical
  axis is the expression levels of Vv‐PAL. (b) Relative gene expression levels of
  Vv‐cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase (Vv‐C4H). The horizontal axis is the storage days after
  inoculation, the vertical axis is the expression levels of Vv‐C4H. (c) Relative
  gene expression levels of Vv‐4‐coumarate coaligase (Vv‐4CL). The horizontal axis
  is the storage days after inoculation, the vertical axis is the expression levels
  of Vv‐4CL. (d) Relative gene expression levels of Vv‐chalcone synthase (Vv‐CHS).
  The horizontal axis is the storage days after inoculation, the vertical axis is
  the expression levels of Vv‐CHS. Samples were measured separately at 1 to 5 DAI.
  The error line is the standard deviation of multiple biological replicates; results
  are mean ± standard deviation and the analysis of the significance of the data differences
  was performed using the t‐test; *p < .05; **p < .01
