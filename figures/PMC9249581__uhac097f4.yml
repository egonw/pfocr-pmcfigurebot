caption: Expression profiles of genes involved in the polyphenol metabolism. Gene
  expression was measured by Realtime qPCR in samples from mature green (MG), breaker
  (B), breaker +7 days (B + 7) and ripe (R) fruits in WT and Bronze tomato line (n = 3).
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase;
  ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; 3GT, flavonol-3-glucosyltransferase; 5GT, anthocyanin-5-glucosyltransferase;
  AOM, anthocyanin O-methyl-transferase; MTP77 (anthocyanin permease); LHA1 (plasma
  membrane H+-ATPase). Significance assumed at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

  and molecular changes during fruit ripening in “Bronze” tomato.
