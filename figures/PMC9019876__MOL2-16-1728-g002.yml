caption: DCZ0415 modulates the EMT and Wnt signalling of CRC cells. (A) Western blot
  analysis showing the expression of EMT proteins in lysates of DCZ0415‐treated CRC
  cells. (B) Vimentin, N‐cadherin and Snai1 protein expression in DCZ0415‐treated
  xenografts. (C) Immunoblot analysis for TRIP13, FGFR4 and N‐cadherin levels in corresponding
  normal colon (N) and CRC (T) tissue samples of patients. Samples from four CRC patients
  were utilized for this experiment. Expression of Wnt/β‐catenin pathway target molecules
  in DCZ0415‐treated (D) cells and (E) xenograft lysates as determined by western
  blotting. (F) Immunoblot analysis for molecules of the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling
  pathway in corresponding normal colon (N) and CRC (T) samples.
article_title: DCZ0415, a small‐molecule inhibitor targeting TRIP13, inhibits EMT
  and metastasis via inactivation of the FGFR4/STAT3 axis and the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway
  in colorectal cancer.
