caption: Knockdown of LHX6EX(+12) and LHX6All group induced cell apoptosis and cell
  cycle arrest in vitro. (A‐C) Cell apoptosis of CasKi and HeLa cells was detected
  by flow cytometry analysis. Apoptosis rate was showed in (B), (C). (D) Cell cycle
  of CasKi and HeLa cells were measured by flow cytometry analysis. (E, F) Distribution
  of different phases. (G) Cell cycle and apoptosis‐related proteins expression were
  detected by western blot in CasKi and HeLa cells. (H) The densitometric analyses
  of cell cycle and apoptosis‐related proteins in CasKi and HeLa cells. The data were
  presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001
