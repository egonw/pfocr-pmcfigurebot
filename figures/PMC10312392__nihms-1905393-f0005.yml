figure_title: DHT-stimulated human islet a and b cell transcriptome involved in glycolysis
  and TCA cycle
caption: (A) Human islets (750 IEQ/condition) were cultured for 24 h with vehicle
  and DHT and single-cell RNA sequencing. Data represent a multiple-donor integrated
  multidimensional uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) plot. The plot
  shows 28,809 single cells where each dot represents the transcriptome of a single
  cell. Clusters of characteristic cell types on the basis of their transcriptional
  footprint are color coded and labeled.(B) UMAP plot of data classified in (A) showing
  the expression of GLP-1R transcripts across individual islet cells.(C) Dot plot
  showing the percentage of cells across each cluster expressing cell-type-specific
  genes.(D) UMAP plot of data classified in (A) showing the expression of AR transcripts
  across individual islet cells.(E) Volcano plot showing differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) for DHT vs. vehicle treatment in the Beta 1 cluster. Blue, genes with
  FDR < 0.05 and log2 fold change < −0.137; red, genes with FDR < 0.05 and log2 fold
  change > 0.137; black, genes below both thresholds.(F) Bar plot showing enriched
  gene ontology (GO) pathway terms for the DEGs shown in (E).(G–L) (G) Volcano plot
  showing DEGs for DHT vs. vehicle treatment in the Beta 2 cluster, as in (E). (H)
  Bar plot showing enriched GO pathway terms for the DEGs shown in (G). (I) Volcano
  plot showing DEGs for DHT vs. vehicle treatment in the Alpha 1 cluster, as in (E).
  (J) Bar plot showing enriched GO pathway terms for the DEGs shown in (I). (K) Volcano
  plot showing DEGs for DHT vs. vehicle treatment in the Alpha 2 cluster, as in (E).
  (L) Bar plot showing enriched GO pathway terms for the DEGs shown in (K).(M) Schematic
  representation of the effect of DHT on glycolysis and TCA cycle genes and pathways
  described in (E) to (L).Data represent n = 3 donors. Values represent the mean ±
  SE. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
