caption: 'Pathway enrichment analysis from CpG methylation (RRBS) results. Pathway
  enrichment was performed using FRY algorithm with GO database (Biological Process,
  BP, domain). A, All enriched pathways were connected to each other using the shared
  gene information. Linked-communities (n = 11) identifying the shared properties
  across all enriched pathways were calculated. The names show uniquely enriched terms.
  B, Enriched pathway terms were shared by multiple linked-communities. The view is
  zoomed in from the region defined by the rectangle in panel A. C, Hierarchical clustering
  of all pathway linked-communities resulted in 6 unique clusters. Cluster 1: nicotine
  response, alveolar and brain development; Cluster 2: oxidative stress response;
  Cluster 3: cellular signaling and cell cycle; Cluster 4: cellular signaling and
  transcriptional regulation; Cluster 5: NF-κB transcriptional regulation by protein
  ubiquitination; Cluster 6: GO terms with no shared genes between each other, and
  GO terms unique to specific linked-communities'
