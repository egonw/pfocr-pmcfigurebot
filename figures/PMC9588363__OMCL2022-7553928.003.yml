caption: miR-214-3p regulated EMT via PTEN/PI3K/AKT. (a) miR-214-3p levels by qRT–PCR
  in control, TGF-β1, TGF − β1 + LV − miR − 214 − OE, TGF − β1 + LV − NC − OE, TGF
  − β1 + LV − miR − 214 − KD, and TGF − β1 + LV − NC − KD cells, and the internal
  reference miRNA was U6. (b, c) qRT–PCR-based expression outcomes for PTEN, PI3K,
  AKT, α-SMA, COL1, and FN at the mRNA level. (d–f) WB-based protein level outcomes
  for PTEN, PI3K, COL1, p-AKT, t-AKT, FN, and α-SMA in the control group, as well
  as in the TGF-β1, TGF − β1 + LV − miR − 214 − OE, TGF − β1 + LV − miR − 214 − KD,
  TGF − β1 + LV − NC − OE, and TGF − β1 + LV − NC − KD groups. In the result analysis,
  t-AKT and GAPDH served separately as the internal references for p-AKT and other
  proteins. (g, i) Typical immunofluorescence images showing PTEN and PI3K. PTEN was
  clearly distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. PI3K was mostly expressed in the
  cytoplasm. DAPI, blue; PTEN and PI3K, red; scale bars, 50 μm. (h, j) Fluorescence
  intensity outcomes for the PTEN and PI3K. The data represented are in terms of means
  ± SDs, n = 3. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 against the
  TGF-β1/control group.
