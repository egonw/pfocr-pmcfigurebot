caption: FPIA allows identifying tumour lineage-specific signalling. PI3K-associated
  target genes and their significant correlations in a predefined subset of genes
  belonging to KEGG pathway hsa04151 (in addition to the target gene set) for individual
  tumour lineages within the combined RNAi DepMap dataset (q < 0.05). Data ranked
  by counts (labelled) of significant correlations; self-correlations omitted
article_title: Systematic identification of biochemical networks in cancer cells by
  functional pathway inference analysis.
