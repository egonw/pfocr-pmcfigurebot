caption: The three major routes of tryptophan after ingestion, metabolism, and absorption
  in the human gut. Tryptophan can be absorbed into the blood stream and metabolized
  via the kynurenine pathway in the liver or via the serotonin or kynurenine pathway
  in the brain. Within the gut, tryptophan can also be funneled towards the kynurenine,
  indole, or serotonin pathway. These three metabolic pathways contain neuroactive
  metabolites that affect host physiology and neurology. Fading lines represent metabolism
  to a primary compound, dotted lines represent metabolism to secondary or downstream
  metabolites, green text ovals represent positive effects, red ovals represent negative
  effects, and orange ovals represent neutral outcomes.
