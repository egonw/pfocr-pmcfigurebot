caption: 'Class Ⅳ PRTase in the histidine biosynthesis pathway regulates plant growth
  and development. Class Ⅳ PRTase ATP–PRT regulates chloroplast development and plant
  growth under nutrient-adequate conditions by influencing intracellular His level
  and AMP/ATP metabolism. ATP–PRT is represented by a square box, and other proteins
  are represented by round boxes. Solid arrows indicate direct interactions or one-step
  reactions, and dashed arrows indicate indirect interactions, multistep reactions,
  or transmembrane transport. Abbreviations for proteins are as follows: Arabidopsis
  histidine kinase (AHK), Arabidopsis response regulator (ARR), target of rapamycin
  (TOR), ATP phosphoribosyltransferase (ATP–PRT). Abbreviations for metabolites are
  shown in the Abbreviations list.'
