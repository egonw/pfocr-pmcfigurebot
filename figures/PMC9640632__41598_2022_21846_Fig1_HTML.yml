caption: 'Modeled pathway and model creation workflow. (A) Glycolysis and TCA cycle
  reactions modeled, including neomorphic activity of IDH Mutant. For glycolysis the
  following metabolites and abbreviations were used: Gluc, glucose; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  Pyr, pyruvate; Lac, lactate; ACoA, acetyl-CoA; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Lip,
  lipids. For TCA cycle the following metabolites and abbreviations were used: Gln,
  glutamine; Cit, citrate; aKG, alpha-ketoglutarate; Mal, malate; Oac, oxaloacetate;
  2HG, 2-hydroxyglutarate. (B) Workflow of PRISM model creation: specification of
  reactions; instantiation of rates with Grassian et al.metabolic flux rates of isogenic
  colorectal carcinoma cell lines (with the parental cell line have IDH wild type,
  and a derived cell line with induction of IDH mutation expression) under normoxia
  and hypoxia; use of TCGA mRNA expression from patient derived glioma (IDH WT and
  IDH Mutant) and normal brain to estimate relative rates of metabolic activity for
  the pairs; specification of properties in probabilistic logic; instantiation of
  nutrient concentration; model checking of resulting models.'
