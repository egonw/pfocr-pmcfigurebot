caption: PIK3C3 overexpression promoted autophagy in liver. (A) Immunofluorescence
  staining of LC3B and LAMP-1 in the liver tissue of WT and PIK3C3 transgenic piglets.
  Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) Mean integrated optical density of the immunofluorescence
  staining of LC3B and LAMP-1 in the liver tissue of WT and PIK3C3 transgenic piglets.
  (C) Relative expression levels of ATG and autophagy signaling pathway genes’ mRNA
  in the liver tissue from WT and PIK3C3 transgenic piglets measured by using q-PCR.
  (D) Relative expression levels of ATG and autophagy signalingpathway genes’ mRNA
  in the spleen tissue from WT and PIK3C3 transgenic piglets measured using q-PCR.
  The expression of the GAPDH gene was used to normalize the values of ATG. * p <
  0.05 and ** p < 0.01 denote significant differences in PIK3C3 transgenic piglets
  compared to WT piglets.
