caption: 'Effects of PP-MP exposure on protein expression of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (A) Western blot of TLR4, p105, p50, p65, p-p65, and IκBα protein expression.
  GAPDH was used as an internal reference. (B–G) Quantitative expression of these
  proteins. The values are the means ± SD (n = 4). # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 between
  PP-MP treated groups, and * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. SC as determined by one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA). BC: blank control (pure water); SC: solvent control
  (pure water containing 0.01% v/v Tween-80); PP-MPs: polypropylene microplastics.'
