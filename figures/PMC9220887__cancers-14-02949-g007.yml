caption: 'Synergistic drug interactions between CB-5083 and specific ER stress inducers.
  Dose response to the combination of CB-5083 and an IREα inhibitor (STF) (A), integrated
  stress response pathway inhibitor (ISRIB) (B), or ATF6 pathway inhibitor S1P (C)
  in RMG1 cells. (D): Clonogenic assay to assess the combined effect of CB-5083 and
  ISRIB. (E): Clonogenic assay to assess the triple combination of CB-5083, ISRIB,
  and mifepristone. Mean percent survival ± SEM was calculated based on the number
  of colonies from three biological replicates. p values were calculated in reference
  to CB-5083 treatment alone using the two-tailed Student’s t-test.'
