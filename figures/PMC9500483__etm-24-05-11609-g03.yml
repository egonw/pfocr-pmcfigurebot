caption: Ac2-26 exerts protective effect against HIRI through inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. (A) The expression of p-NF-κB and NF-κB was examined by western
  blot analysis. (B) Western blot analysis of IκBα. (C) The ratio of p-NF-κB/NF-κB
  protein expressions. (D) The relative expressions of IκBα protein quantified via
  normalization to GAPDH. Data are analyzed as Tukey's test and expressed as means
  ± standard error of the mean. *P<0.05, **P<0.01; ns, not significant; HIRI, hepatic
  ischemia-reperfusion injury; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; p-, phosphorylated.
article_title: Ac2‑26 alleviates hepatic ischemia‑reperfusion injury based on inhibiting
  the positive feedback loop of HMGB1/TLR4/NF‑κB/neutrophils.
