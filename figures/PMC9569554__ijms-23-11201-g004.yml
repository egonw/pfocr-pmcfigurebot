caption: HIFs/EPO pathway. (A) PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. EPO stimulation activates
  PI3-kinase, and protein kinase B (PKB)/protein kinase-B (Akt) is activated downstream
  of PI3-kinase. Activated Akt phosphorylates decrease the ability of TSC2 to inhibit
  mTOR, resulting in the activation of mTOR, which mediates bone. EPO directly promotes
  the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts via the PI3K/AKT signal pathway and
  decreases osteoclast activity at the same time. (B) EphrinB2/EphB4 signaling pathway.
  EPO induces enhanced expression of EphB4 by osteoblasts, which, when activated by
  EphrinB2 expressed by osteoclasts, leads to enhanced osteoblast activity, increasing
  bone formation. (C) Skeletal repair. EPO lowers NF-ÎºB expression and regulates inflammation,
  promoting fracture healing. At the same time, EPCs migrate to ischaemic areas or
  defect sites to improve the repair of blood vessels. EPO interacts with EPOR-expressed
  hypertrophic chondrocytes to promote endochondral ossification.
