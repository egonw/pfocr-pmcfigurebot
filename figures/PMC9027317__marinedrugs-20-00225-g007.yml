caption: 'Effects of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation
  and expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. (A) Western blot analysis of
  p-AMPK, AMPK, sterol regulatory element binding proteins-1c (SREBP-1c) and peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC) and ACC, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), and fatty acid synthase
  (FAS) in the FFA-treated cells; (B) quantitative analysis for p-AMPK/AMPK; (C) quantitative
  analysis for PPARα; (D) quantitative analysis for SREBP-1c; (E) quantitative analysis
  for p-ACC/ACC; (F) quantitative analysis for CPT-1; (G) quantitative analysis for
  FAS. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3), * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01 vs. control group, ## p < 0.01 vs. FFA group.'
