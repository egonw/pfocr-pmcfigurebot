caption: 'Changes in the intra-tumoral immune phenotype after TNIKi treatment in MC38
  tumors. A) Tumors were harvested at day 9 of treatment for flow cytometry analysis
  for endpoint analyses. With TNIK inhibition in the MC38 model, tumoral infiltration
  of CD8+ T-cells was significantly increased as seen in the serial analysis in  and  (),
  whereas such a change was not detected in lymph nodes or spleens of the same tumor-bearing
  mice. B) The number of PD-1+ CD8+ T-cell was increased indicating potential up-regulation
  of immune checkpoint pathway signaling. C) The number of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T-cells was
  also increased, indicating that a fraction of the CD8+ T-cells possess effector
  function. D) The CD8+ T-cell/Treg ratio was also increased with TNIK inhibition.
  Each data point in (B–F) is presented with mean ± standard deviation. One-way ANOVA
  with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons tests were used for statistical analyses (n
  = 6 per experimental group; *<0.05, **<0.005, ***<0.0005, NS: not significant).'
