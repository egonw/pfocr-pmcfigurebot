caption: Aberrant dendritic morphology in mutant neurons is regulated by TrkB and
  is rescued by enhancement of PARP1 activity. (A) Fluorescence microscopic images
  of hippocampal culture neurons (DIV 18) from the indicated genotypes. DHIQ or ANA
  treatments were performed. (B) Quantification of Sholl analysis for the dendritic
  arborization of neurons in A. (C and D) Fluorescence microscopic images of hippocampal
  culture neurons (DIV 18) from the indicated genotypes. DHIQ or NAD treatments (both
  C and D) and transfection with Mut-KIF4-EGFP in C or PARP1-tagRFP in D were performed.
  Scale bars, 50 µm. D/N, both DHIQ and NAD. (E and F) Quantification of Sholl analysis
  for the dendritic arborization of neurons in A and B. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM (n = 18, 3 independent experiments). ns, P > 0.05, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way
  ANOVA).
