caption: The upstream regulatory network of the Hippo signaling pathway. Cell junction
  related proteins are located on the cell membrane. Mainly divided into tight junctions
  (TJs) and adhesive connections (AJs). Ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9X)
  in the ubiquitin-specific protease family (DUBs) could bind to and deubiquitinate
  angiomotin (AMOT). FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT) is the first transmembrane receptor
  identified to affect the expression of the Hippo pathway, and it is also a transmembrane
  apex determinant. The mechanism by which FAT affects the expression of the Hippo
  pathway depends on the relationship between FAT and Expande (Ex).
