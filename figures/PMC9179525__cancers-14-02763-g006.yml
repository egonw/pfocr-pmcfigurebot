caption: Kaplan Meier (KM) plots measuring progression free survival (PFS) in serous
  ovarian cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 979) related
  to selected proteins. (A) RNA binding protein PNO1 (PNO1) showed abundance at least
  1.5-fold lower in parental cell lines and is associated with significantly decreased
  PFS. (B) High affinity copper uptake protein (SLC31A1) showed abundance at least
  1.5-fold higher in parental cell lines and is associated with significantly increased
  PFS. (C) Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) showed abundance at least 1.5-lower
  in parental cell lines and is associated with significantly decreased PFS. (D) Asparagine
  synthase (ASNS) showed abundance at least 1.5-fold higher in OVCAR-5 parental cells,
  is part of the enriched Alanine, Aspartate and Glutamate Metabolism pathway, and
  is associated with significantly increased PFS.
