caption: 'Suppression of RNF43 frameshift mutant PDX tumor development by a PORCN
  inhibitor. (A) Schematic drawing of the strategy for the drug dosing experiment.
  The red bar indicates the PORCN inhibitor (ETC‐159) treatment period. (B) Representative
  photographs of PDX tumors of C45 parental organoids and two subclones (C45‐3 and
  C45‐6) developed in no‐drug control mice (top) and ETC‐159‐treated mice (bottom).
  Bars: 5 mm. Photographs of PDX tumors of C14, C24, and subclones are shown in supplementary
  material, Figure A. (C) Tumor volume changes of the control (blue) and ETC‐159‐treated
  PDX mice (red) are indicated as line graphs (mean ± SEM). Transplanted organoid
  clone numbers are indicated. A two‐sided t‐test was used to calculate statistical
  significance.*p < 0.05 versus control. (D) Representative histology photographs
  of PDX tumors developed in the control (left) and ETC‐159‐treated mice (right) for
  C45 parental organoids and C45‐3 and C45‐6 subclones (left to right). H&E (top)
  and immunohistochemistry for Ki67 (bottom). Insets are enlarged images of the regions
  indicated by yellow arrowheads. Bars: 200 μm. The images are representative of n = 6–8
  biologically independent experiments. Histology results for C14, C24, and subclones
  are shown in supplementary material, Figure B. (E) Schematic illustration of serrated
  pathway CRC development. SSL, sessile serrated lesion; SSL‐D, SSL with dysplasia;
  CIMP, CpG island methylator phenotype; MLH1me, MLH1 gene promoter hypermethylation.'
