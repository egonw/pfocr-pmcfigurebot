caption: CASC2 was down-regulated in CRC tissues and cells. A. qRT-PCR was used to
  detect the expression of CASC2 in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues (n=65).
  B. qRT-PCR was adopted to detect the expression of CASC2 in normal colorectal mucosal
  cell line (FHC) and CRC cell lines (Colo678, HCT116, SW620, LoVo cells). C. Subcellular
  fractionation assay was used to measure the expression of CASC2, GAPDH and U6 in
  the nuclei and cytoplasm of Colo-678 and HCT116 cells. D. Kaplan-Meier analysis
  showed a correlation between CASC2 expression and overall survival of CRC patients.
  Data are represented as the mean Â± SD (n=3). **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001, CRC; Colorectal
  cancer, and qRT-PCR; Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
