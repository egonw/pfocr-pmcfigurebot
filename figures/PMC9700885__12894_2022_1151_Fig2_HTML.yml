caption: 'Effects of the NEAT1/miR-101 pathway on BC cells. A The putative binding
  sites of NEAT1 with miR-101 are listed. The results of the luciferase assay indicated
  that overexpressed miR-101 significantly decreased the activity of the wild-type
  NEAT1 3′-UTR reporter but did not influence the activity of the mutant NEAT1 3′-UTR
  reporter. **p < 0.01 miR-101 group versus NC group. B After 24 h, the proliferation
  of the cells with enforced NEAT1 expression and a miR-101 inhibitor was significantly
  higher than that in the NEAT1 group in both T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 miR-101
  inhibitor + NEAT1 group versus NEAT1 group. The proliferation of the cells with
  enforced NEAT1 expression and a miR-101 mimic was significantly lower than that
  in the NEAT1 group in both T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 miR-101 mimic + NEAT1
  group versus NEAT1 group. C, D The quantitative results of the migration and invasion
  assays showed that the migration and invasion of the cells with enforced NEAT1 expression
  and a miR-101 inhibitor were significantly higher than those in the NEAT1 group
  both in T24 and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1 group versus NEAT1
  group. The migration and invasion of the cells with enforced NEAT1 expression and
  a miR-101 mimic were significantly lower than those in the NEAT1 group in both T24
  and 5637 cells. **p < 0.01 miR-101 mimic + NEAT1 group versus NEAT1 group. E The
  expression of miR-101 mRNA was significantly increased after transfection with NEAT1
  and a miR-101 mimic and decreased after transfection with NEAT1 and a miR-101 inhibitor.
  **p < 0.01 miR-101 mimic + NEAT1/miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1 group versus NEAT1 group.
  The expression of VEGF-C mRNA was significantly decreased after transfection with
  NEAT1 and a miR-101 mimic and increased after transfection with NEAT1 and a miR-101
  inhibitor. **p < 0.01 miR-101 mimic + NEAT1/miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1 group versus
  NEAT1 group. F. The VEGF-C levels of the cells were significantly decreased after
  transfection with NEAT1 and a miR-101 mimic and increased after transfection with
  NEAT1 and a miR-101 inhibitor (Additional file : Figure S2). **p < 0.01 miR-101
  mimic + NEAT1/miR-101 inhibitor + NEAT1 group versus NEAT1 group'
