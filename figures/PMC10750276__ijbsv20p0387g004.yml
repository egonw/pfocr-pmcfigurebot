caption: KLF7 promotes activation of JAK/STAT3, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK signaling pathways.
  (A) A heatmap of the mRNAs of the significant DEGs between empty vector (EV) and
  KLF7 stable overexpressed cells(n=3). (B) Selection and enrichment significates
  in KEGG signaling pathways; 20 most important signaling pathways are shown and sorted
  based on P value. (C, D) Representative Western Blot analysis of the activation
  of enriched MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT3, and PI3K/AKT pathway in transient vectors (empty
  vector (EV) or KLF7) transfected SW620 cells (C), or indicated transient siRNA transfected
  Lovo cells (D) that treated with conditioned media (0.5% FBS). (E) Venn diagrams
  display the significant DEGs that were similarly altered in the MAPK/ERK, RAS, JAK/STAT3,
  and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. (F) Heatmap representing the mRNA expression of
  PDGFB, PDGFRβ, and HRAS genes between empty vector (EV) andKLF7 transient overexpressed
  cells(n=3). (G) Effects of KLF7 on the mRNA expression of PDGFB, PDGFRβ, and HRAS
  in the indicated cells (n=3). ns, not significant, ** P<0.01 and *** P <0.001.
