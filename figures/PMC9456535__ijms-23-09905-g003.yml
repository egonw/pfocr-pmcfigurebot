caption: 'Expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the biofilms
  of the WT and ∆ftcR strains: (A) Heatmap showing the expression levels of DEGs between
  the biofilms of WT and ∆ftcR. (B) Volcano plot of expressed genes between the biofilms
  of WT and ∆ftcR. The red, green, and blue colors denote upregulated, downregulated,
  and non-regulated genes, respectively, based on the following criteria: absolute
  log2 (fold change) ≥ 1, and adjusted p (Padj) ≤ 0.01. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the number and function of differentially expressed
  genes. The rich factor represents the ratio of DEG numbers annotated with this pathway
  term to all gene numbers annotated with this pathway term. A greater rich factor
  indicates a greater degree of pathway enrichment. Padj represents the corrected
  p-value, and ranges from 0 to 1; a lower value indicates greater pathway enrichment.
  (D) Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms.'
