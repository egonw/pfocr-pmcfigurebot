caption: 'LPAR1 knockdown inhibited LPA−induced changes in the expression levels of
  EMT markers and fibrotic factors in HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells were transfected with
  control siRNA (siCon) or LPAR1 siRNA (siLPAR1) for 6 h. Next, the medium was replaced
  with a serum-free medium (SFM), then the cells were incubated for 16–18 h and treated
  with 20 μM LPA for 48 h. Protein levels of (A) LPAR1, (B) E-cadherin and vimentin,
  and (C) fibronectin and α-SMA were analyzed via Western blotting, quantified using
  ImageJ software, and normalized to that of β-actin. Representative images (left)
  and quantitative analysis bar graphs (right) are shown (n = 3 independent experiments).
  Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05 vs. siCon or siCon + BSA; # p <
  0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.005 vs. siCon + LPA.'
