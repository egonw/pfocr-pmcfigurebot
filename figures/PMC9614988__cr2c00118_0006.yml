caption: Biosynthetic pathway encoded by Megavirus chilensis to produce two UDP-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-HexNAc.
  UDP-β-l-RhaNAc is produced by four reactions carried out by two bifunctional enzymes,
  Mg534 and Mg535, both resembling prokaryotic enzymes. The crystallographic structure
  of Mg534 is reported and colored according to its secondary structure elements (α-helices
  in red, β-sheets in cyan, and loops in gray). UDP-β-l-QuiNAc is produced from UDP-β-l-RhaNAc
  by C-2 epimerization promoted by Mg536. The activities of Mg534 and Mg535 have been
  experimentally validated, while that of Mg536 was predicted in silico, and it is
  supported by the monosaccharide analysis of Megavirus chilensis fibrils.
