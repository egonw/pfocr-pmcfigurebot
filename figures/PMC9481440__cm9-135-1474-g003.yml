caption: 'Further inhibition of necroptosis reactivated apoptosis and pyroptosis.
  Rats were further administered with Nec-1s based on SB203580. At 24 h after CLP,
  (A) caspase-3, Bcl-2, (B) NLRP3, caspase-1, (C) RIPK1, RIPK3, and p-MLKL in different
  groups are shown, with GAPDH used as the loading control. n = 5. Data are represented
  by histograms, and the sham group is normalized. ∗P < 0.05. All experiments were
  repeated three times and error bars depict mean ± standard deviation. CASP: Caspase;
  CLP: Cecal ligation and perforation; MLKL: Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein;
  NLRP3: NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3; RIPK: Receptor-interacting
  protein kinase.'
