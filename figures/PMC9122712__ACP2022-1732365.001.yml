caption: Low expression of miR-585-3p in ovarian cancer. (a) The expression of miR-585-3p
  in OC tissues and adjacent tissues. (b) RT-qPCR assays to detect the expression
  of miR-585-3p in OC cells SKOV3, SW626, and human normal ovary cell IOSE-80. (c)
  The relative expression of miR-585-3p in the SW626 cells after transfection of miR-585-3p
  overexpression. (d) The relative expression of miR-585-3p in the SKOV3 cells after
  transfection of miR-585-3p knockdown. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001.
article_title: Study on the Function and Mechanism of miR-585-3p Inhibiting the Progression
  of Ovarian Cancer Cells by Targeting FSCN1 to Block the MAPK Signaling Pathway.
