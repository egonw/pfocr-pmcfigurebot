caption: The effect of co-culturing with C1R, C1R-B*2704 C67S, or C1R-B*2704 cells
  on the PI3K/AKT signaling of NK-92MI cells. (A) Analysis of the PI3K/AKT signaling
  in NK-92MI cells induced by co-culturing with C1R, C1R-B*2704 C67S, or C1R-B*2704
  cells by using Western blotting. An aliquot (50 Î¼g) of crude proteins extracted
  from NK-92MI cells after co-culturing with C1R, C1R-B*2704 C67S, or C1R-B*2704 cells
  was separated with SDS-PAGE, analyzed via Western blotting, and probed for phospho-AKT,
  AKT, and actin. (B) The ratio of phospho-AKT/actin averaged from four independent
  experiments in A is plotted. The ratio of phospho-AKT/actin obtained from NK-92MI
  cells co-cultured with C1R cells was set to one. (C) The induced PI3K/AKT pathway
  of NK-92MI cells co-cultured with C1R-B*2704 cells was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor.
  (D) The ratio of phospho-AKT/actin averaged from four independent experiments in
  C is plotted. (E) The perforin expression of NK-92MI cells co-cultured with C1R-B*2704
  was suppressed by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor. (F) The ratio of perforin/actin
  averaged from four independent experiments in E is plotted.
