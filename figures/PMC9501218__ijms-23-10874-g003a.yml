caption: 'MLK3 is phosphorylated in activated RAW264.7 cells during exposure to LPS,
  Pam3CSK, and poly(I:C). (a–e) The mRNA expression levels of MLK3 and inflammatory
  genes (COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were determined by real-time PCR from RAW264.7
  cells stimulated with LPS. (f). The phospho- and total forms of MLK3 were detected
  in whole cell lysates of RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS, Pam3CSK, and poly(I:C)
  by immunoblotting analysis. Results (a–e) are expressed as mean ± SD. # p < 0.05
  and ## p < 0.01 compared to the normal group (no treatment).'
