caption: Depletion of CD73 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. A, Western blot detecting the
  expression of CD73 in HNSCC cell lines and HOK cells. B, Western blot detecting
  the expression of CD73 in CAL27 and HN4 cells transfected with si‐NC and si‐CD73.
  C, D, CCK‐8 assay estimating the viability of CAL27 and HN4 cells after transfection
  with si‐NC and si‐CD73. E, F, EdU assay estimating the proliferation ratio of CAL27
  and HN4 cells after transfection with si‐NC and si‐CD73. G, Colony‐formation assay
  estimating the colony‐formation ability of CAL27 and HN4 cells after transfection
  with si‐NC and si‐CD73. H, J, Wound‐healing assay estimating the migration ability
  of CAL27 and HN4 cells after transfection with si‐NC and si‐CD73. I, K, Transwell
  migration and invasion assays estimating the migration and invasion ability of CAL27
  and HN4 cells after transfection with si‐NC and si‐CD73. L, Western blot detecting
  the expression of EMT‐related and proliferation‐related markers in CAL27 and HN4
  cells after transfection with si‐NC and si‐CD73. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001
