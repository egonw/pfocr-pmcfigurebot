caption: 'Potential effector axis of Th17 cells independent of IL-23 stimulation.
  From top to bottom: Prostaglandin E2 plays a critical role in ankylosing spondylitis
  by activating Th17 cells in an RORC-dependent pathway. Despite its multifaceted
  proinflammatory effects, IL-17 may overrepresent Th17 function. The paradoxical
  inflammation induced by the RORC blockade elicits the discovery of the intrinsic
  negative feedback of IL-17, where the IL-24 autocrine induced by IL-17 regulates
  cytokine production by SOCS1/3. In contrast, GM-CSF, a secret weapon of Th17, is
  not under the regulation of RORC. GM-CSF secretion by T cells or nonimmune cells
  may represent a protocol of the early stage in response to a broad range of tissue
  damage and DAMPs via TLR and TNFR signaling, as well as a particular pathogenic
  pathway in autoimmune disease.'
