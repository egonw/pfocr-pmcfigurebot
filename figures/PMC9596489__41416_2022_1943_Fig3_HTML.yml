figure_title: The CPT score correlates with increased neoantigen burden in MIBC
caption: a Patterns of mutational signatures and total number of neoantigens in patient
  subgroups defined by CPT score in TCGA cohort. Kruskal–Wallis test was performed
  (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). b The pathway scores of antigen processing
  and presentation were compared among patient subgroups defined by CPT score. Kruskal–Wallis
  test was performed (***P < 0.001). c Higher CPT score is associated with increased
  T cell receptor repertoire richness and clonotype diversity. Kruskal–Wallis test
  was performed (***P < 0.001). d The pathway scores of T cell receptor signalling
  were compared among patient subgroups defined by CPT score. Kruskal–Wallis test
  was performed (***P < 0.001). HRD homologous recombination deficiency, MMR mismatch
  repair, SNV single-nucleotide variant, TCR T cell antigen receptor.
