caption: Tracking lymphocyte migration in 3D organotypic tumor culture. (a) Schematic
  view of the microfluidic device used for 3D culture of thyroid tumor spheroids (scale
  bar shows 1 mm). Patient-derived tumor spheroids containing autologous immune cells
  were loaded in a collagen medium in the central channel of the device and subjected
  to anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment. A representative bright-field image
  of a thyroid tumor spheroid shows cells migrated into the surrounding collagen.
  (b) Cell trajectories in three different conditions of pathway inhibition. A total
  of 12, 28, and 9 migrating cells were tracked in the conditions of anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4,
  and combination exposure, as indicated. For each experiment, individual trajectories
  are shown with distinct colors, and all trajectories started from the same point
  (coordinate center) that is overlaid on the same graph. Time-lapse images were captured
  every 15 min for at least 130 h.
