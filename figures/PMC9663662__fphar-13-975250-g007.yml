caption: Schematic of the molecular mechanisms of Gm26917 roles in LPS-induced inflammation
  in macrophages. LPS challenge induces the expression of FOXM1, a transcriptional
  activator. FOXM1 binds to the promoter region of Gm26917 and alters the expression
  of Gm26917 after LPS treatment. Gm26917 specifically promotes K6-, K11-, K27-, K33-
  and K63-linked polyubiquitylation of ANXA1, which can enhance its interaction with
  NEMO and eventually activate the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. In this way, Gm26917 can
  regulate macrophage immune responses in LPS-induced acute liver injury.
