figure_title: Regulation of cGAS activity in cells
caption: cGAS activation is positively and negatively regulated by various mechanisms
  in cells. cGAS is localized in not only in cytosol but also in the nucleus and on
  the plasma membrane, which restricts the access to the cytosolic DNA. cGAS reactivity
  to the chromosomal DNA is restricted in the nucleus. cGAS tethering to the acidic
  patch of nucleosomes and BAF binding to DNA prevents cGAS from binding DNA. Besides
  these mechanisms restricting cGAS accessibility to DNA, cGAS is hyperphosphorylated
  at its N-terminal region and catalytic activity is attenuated. Post-translational
  modification such as K27-linked polyubiquitination, monoubiquitination, Neddylation,
  and SUMOylation positively regulate cGAS activity, whereas K48-linked polyubiquitination,
  acetylation, and Caspase-mediated cleavage of cGAS negatively regulate the activity.
  Moreover, cofactor proteins including PQBP1, G3BP1, and ZCCHC3 promote DNA binding,
  oligomerization, and phase separation of cGAS. Phase separation-induced condensates
  restricts TREX1-mediated degradation of DNA and therefore accelerate cGAMP synthesis.
