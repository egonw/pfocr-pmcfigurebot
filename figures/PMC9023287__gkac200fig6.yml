caption: 'Mutation associated SWAN shifts. (A) All cancers with a significantly different
  SWAN shift spectrum for p53 mutant tumors compared to p53 wild-type tumors are shown
  for the KEGG: Autophagy pathway. (B) SWAN feather plot of suppressed autophagy genes.
  UCEC samples with p53 mutation are plotted as circles, samples with no p53 mutation
  as crosses. Filled diamonds represent mean SWAN shifts per gene. Inset panel shows
  overall survival of p53 mutant UCEC compared to non-mutant UCEC. (C) All cancers
  with a significantly different SWAN shift spectrum for RAS (NRAS, HRASÂ or KRAS)
  mutant tumors compared to RAS wild-type tumors are shown for the GO: Inositol phosphate
  mediated signaling pathway. (D) Breast was the only cancer with a significantly
  different SWAN shift spectrum for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant tumors compared to BRCA
  wild-type tumors for the GO: meiotic chromosome separation pathway, with (E) pathway
  genes highlighted for regions of gene deletion by Circos plot (left) or Oncoprint
  (right).'
