caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of KEGG pathway gene sets in hub genes
  high-expression versus low-high-expression samples from SU2C/PCF Dream Team dataset.
  (aâ€“c) Top 3 gene sets (according to GSEA normalized enrichment score) enriched in
  the high-expression group of each hub gene. (a) MCM4; (b) CENPI; (c) KNTC1. NOM
  P value and FDR are shown in each plot. (d) The top 5 most related genes of each
  hub gene. P values were obtained by Spearman or Pearson correlation analysis.
