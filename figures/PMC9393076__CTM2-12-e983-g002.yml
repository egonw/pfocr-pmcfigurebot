caption: CircOMA1 promotes the proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis
  of bladder cancer (BC) in vitro and in vivo. (A) CCK‐8 assays were used to evaluate
  the proliferation changes of BC cells in vitro. (B) EdU assays were used to evaluate
  the proliferation changes of BC cells in vitro. (C) Tumours collected from nude
  mice are shown. (D) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed the difference of Ki‐67‐positive
  cells. (E) Wound‐healing assays were used to evaluate the changes of BC cells migratory
  abilities in vitro. (F) Transwell assays were used to evaluate the changes of BC
  cells invasion abilities in vitro. HUVEC tube formation assays were used to evaluate
  the changes of BC cells angiogenesis abilities in vitro. (G and H) The metastasis
  of BC cells in vivo we also determined using whole‐body fluorescent imaging system,
  and knock‐down of circOMA1 decreased luciferase signals. The data are shown as the
  mean ± SD. *p < .05; **p < .01
