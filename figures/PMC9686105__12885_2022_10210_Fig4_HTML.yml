caption: Exosomal lncRNA HOTAIR polarized the M2macrophage via down-regulating PTEN
  expression and activating a PI3K signaling pathway. Macrophages were incubated with
  exosomes extracted from TU212 cells or TU177 cells for 48 h, PTEN, PI3K and AKT
  in macrophage were tested by performing RT-PCR. B PTEN, PI3K and AKT protein in
  macrophage incubated with exosomes of TU212 cells and TU177 cells were performed
  by using WB. Original gels are presented in Supplementary Fig. -B-AKT, Fig. -B-PI3K,
  Fig. -B-PTEN, Fig. -B-β-actin (AKT), Fig. -B-β-actin (PI3K) and Fig. -B-β-actin
  (PTEN). C RT-PCR for CD206 and CD163 mRNA were measured in macrophage transfected
  with lncRNA HOTAIR mimics, post-transfected with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and si-lncRNA
  HOTAIR inhibitor. Macrophages were transfected with lncRNA HOTAIR mimics, PTEN,
  p-AKT, and AKT protein in macrophage were detected by WB. D and E Macrophages were
  transfected with lncRNA HOTAIR mimics and post-treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002,
  the differential expressions of PTEN, p-AKT, and AKT protein were quantified by
  performing WB. Original gels are presented in Supplementary Fig. -D-AKT, Fig. -D-PI3K,
  Fig. -D-p-AKT, Fig. -D-β-actin (AKT), Fig. -D-β-actin (PI3K) and Fig. -D-β-actin(p-AKT).

  Fig. -E-β-actin (AKT), Fig. -E-β-actin (PI3K) and Fig. -E-β-actin (p-AKT). F Macrophages
  were transfected with si-lncRNA HOTAIR inhibitor, the differential expressions of
  PTEN, p-AKT, and AKT protein were detected by performing WB. Original gels are presented
