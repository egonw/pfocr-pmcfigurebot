caption: 'Screening for an effective concentration of curcumin against oxygen-glucose
  deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). The effective concentration of curcumin against
  OGD/R was determined by CCK8 assay; versus control group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001, respectively; versus OGD/R group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P
  < 0.001. (n = 3). OD = optical density.'
