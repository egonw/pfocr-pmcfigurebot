caption: 'Transcriptome analysis of cecum in HC and HPⅢ groups. (A) Differential gene
  expression analysis between the HC and HPⅢ groups. Red dots (Up) represent significantly
  upregulated genes (P < 0.05, FC ≥ 2); green dots (Down) represent significantly
  downregulated genes (P < 0.05, FC ≤ 0.5); and gray dots (No) represent insignificant
  DEGs. (B) GO classification map of DEGs between the HC and HPⅢ groups. (C) Bubble
  map of DEGs categorized through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (top 20). (D) Influence
  of probiotics on genes downstream the Intestinal immune network for IgA synthesis
  in the cecum of heat-stressed broilers. Inside the text box is the gene; red represents
  significantly upregulated genes; green represents significantly downregulated genes;
  and black represents insignificant DEGs. Abbreviations: DEGs, differentially expressed
  genes; GO, Gene Ontology.'
article_title: Transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal the regulatory effects
  of compound probiotics on cecal metabolism in heat-stressed broilers.
