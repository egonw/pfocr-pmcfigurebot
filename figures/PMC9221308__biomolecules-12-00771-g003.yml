caption: Effects of exposure to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush
  on protein expression of ECM factors in gingival fibroblasts. HGnFs were exposed
  to vibratory stimulation with an electric toothbrush for 7 days. The protein expression
  of four ECM factors (a–l) in the culture supernatants and lysate was quantified
  using ELISA. Each bar indicates mean ± standard deviation (SD) of five independent
  experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (vs. control).
