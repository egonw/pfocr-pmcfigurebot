caption: 'Metabolic pathway analysis of crucial biomarkers (A). The size and colour
  of each circle indicate the pathway impact value and p-value respectively. Statistical
  significance of the 11 potential biomarkers were calculated using ANOVA after administration
  of A. mongolica oil (B). *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared to the model control
  group. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 compared to the control group.'
