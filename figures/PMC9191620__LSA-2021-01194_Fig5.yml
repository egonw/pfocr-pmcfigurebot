caption: 'Comparison of letm1+/+ and letm1−/− compensators versus non-compensators.
  (A, B, C, D) Representative images of zebrafish larvae at 4 day post fertilization,
  wild type (WT) (A), letm1−/− compensators (C) (B), and letm1−/− non-compensators
  (NC) (C, D), sampled for RNA sequencing. Scale bar = 1 mm. (E, F, G) Gene set enrichment
  analysis grouped in clusters according to gene ontology terms. (E, F, G) Up-regulated
  clusters (orange) and down-regulated clusters (blue) are shown for each pairwise
  comparison C versus NC (E), C versus WT (F), and NC versus WT (G). The threshold
  was set to P (adjusted) value = 0.05 and log2 fold change = ±1. (H) Schematic showing
  the kynurenine pathway and Preiss–Handler and salvage pathways for NAD production,
  where certain enzymes are down-regulated in NC and C. NC: letm1−/− non-compensators
  and C: letm1−/− compensators. Dashed lines indicate intermediate metabolic steps.
  (I) Heat map of expression of enzymes involved in the different pathways of NAD
  production in pairwise comparisons C versus NC, C versus WT, and NC versus WT. Stars
  indicate the significance of the adjusted P-value obtained with the Benjamini–Hochberg
  method (*P-value < 0.05; **P-value < 0.01; ***P-value < 0.001).'
