figure_title: Integrated analysis of metabolomics and gene expression data in HCC
caption: (A) Metabolite abundance across COCA clusters. The top two rows (mRNA_cluster
  and metabolite_cluster) show the clustering membership from a single-data modality,
  RNA-seq, or metabolomics data. The top third to seven rows show genetic or clinical
  alteration information. nuclear_mtDNA, mutation in genes in the nuclear DNA related
  to mitochondrial complex; WCDChr7, whole chromosome duplication at chromosome 7;
  TERTmut, mutation in TERT promoter; mTORpathway, mutations in the mTOR pathway;
  histology, histology assignment. (B to E) Significant enriched (red) or depleted
  (blue) KEGG metabolic pathways from RNA GSEA analysis in each consensus cluster
  (only the labels of top three enriched or depleted pathways are shown). (F to I)
  Significant enriched (red) or depleted (blue) KEGG metabolic pathways from metabolite
  GSEA analysis in each consensus cluster (only the labels of top three enriched or
  depleted pathways are shown).
