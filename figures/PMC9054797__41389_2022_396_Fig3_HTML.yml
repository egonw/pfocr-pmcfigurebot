figure_title: NSE modulates the stem cell-like characteristics of SCLC cells
caption: The self-renewal capability of SCLC cells was determined by assessing the
  sphere formation. A Representative morphology of the sphere formed by NSE-overexpressing
  cells (original magnification ×20, scale bar 100 μm). B Representative images of
  sphere formation were displayed after 14 days of culture in NSE-knockdown cells
  (original magnification ×20, scale bar 100 μm). C The bar charts represented the
  percentage of spheroid cells of NSE-overexpressing cells compared to the control
  cells. D The bar charts represented the percentage of spheroid cells of NSE-knockdown
  cells compared to the control cells. E, F The stemness property of H446 cells (E)
  and H69 cells (F) was evaluated by the Extreme Limiting Dilutions Analysis website.
  The mRNA (G) and protein levels (H) of stemness-associated genes upon NSE overexpression
  were detected. I The relative protein expression (protein/β-actin) was analyzed
  by ImageJ software and quantified in a column graph. NSE knockdown inhibited the
  expression of CSC-related genes at the mRNA level (J) and protein level (K). L All
  western blot images were analyzed by ImageJ software, and the relative protein expression
  (protein/β-actin) was quantified in a column graph. SCLC cells in indicated groups
  were treated with cisplatin, and the cell viability was measured using the CCK8
  assay. M–O Compared with EV cells, cells overexpressing NSE showed a dose-dependent
  decrease (M) and time-dependent decrease (N) in the sensitivity to cisplatin. O
  The proportion of alive cells in SCLC cells was also shown as column graphs. P–R
  NSE-knockdown cells were more sensitive to cisplatin than negative control cells
  with a dose-dependent decrease (P) and time-dependent decrease (Q). R The percentage
  of alive cells in SCLC cells is also shown as column graphs. Data are represented
  as mean ± SD for three experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
