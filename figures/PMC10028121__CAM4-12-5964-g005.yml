caption: CD163+ macrophages decreased the sensitivity of EC cells to progestin therapy.
  (A, B) CD163+ macrophages decreased the MPA‐mediated inhibitory effect on EC cell
  proliferation. Ishikawa (A) and ECC‐1 (B) cells were cultured together with the
  indicated dilutions of conditional medium (CM) derived from macrophages and/or MPA
  for 48 h. Cell viability was evaluated with CCK‐8 test (left), and the inhibitory
  rate was calculated (right). (C, D) CD163+ macrophages inhibited MPA‐mediated downregulation
  of cyclin D1 protein and upregulation of p21 and p27 protein in the cell cycle pathway.
  Endometrial cancer cells were treated with CM and/or MPA for 24 h, and the expression
  of cell cycle proteins was analyzed by Western blotting analysis. (E, F) CD163+
  macrophages decreased MPA‐induced apoptotic effects on EC cells. EC cells were cultured
  with CM and/or MPA for 48 h, and the apoptotic rate was determined by flow cytometry.
  All values are presented as the mean ± SD. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001 compared with the control.
