caption: Morphological features and survival of PTCL-EBV patients compared to those
  with ENKTL and PTCL-NOS. (A) Representative images of PTCL-EBV. The tumor cells
  are large and pleomorphic (a, Hematoxylin & eosin, original magnification x400).
  They are positive for CD3 (b, original magnification x400), CD8 (c, original magnification
  x600), T-cell receptor, beta (TCRβ) (d, original magnification x600), EBER (e, original
  magnification x400) and granzyme B (f, original magnification x400). The positive
  expression for TCRβ indicates a T-cell origin. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curve depicting
  overall survival of three disease groups. Patients in the PTCL-EBV group had significantly
  shorter overall survival compared to those in the ENKTL and PTCL-NOS groups.
