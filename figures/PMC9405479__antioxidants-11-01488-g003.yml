caption: Glycolysis modulates NOX2-dependent ROS generation and IFN-β production.
  (A) Oxidative burst measured by L-012-enhanced chemiluminescence in RAW 264.7 macrophages,
  (B,C) mRNA expression measured using qPCR, or (D) IFN-β protein measured by ELISA.
  Cells were pre-treated with 2-DG (1 mM) for 3 h before being stimulated by LPS (100
  ng/mL) for 24 h. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of n = 8–9 experiments. Data are
  expressed as (A) a fold change against the respective control in relative light
  units (RLU), measured as an average of triplicates over a 60-cycle period, subtracted
  by blank readings or the fold change against the vehicle control of a peak response
  over an average of triplicates over the 60-cycle period, subtracted by blank readings,
  (B,C) fold change vs. control against the housekeeping gene RPS18, or (D) in pg/mL.
  Statistical analysis was conducted via a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post
  hoc test for multiple comparisons. * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01,
  *** indicates p < 0.001 and **** indicates p < 0.0001.
