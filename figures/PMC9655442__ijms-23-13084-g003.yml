caption: 'Knockdown of ARK5 expression attenuates the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway.
  (A) Quantitative PCR and Western blot for ARK5 and fibrotic genes in control and
  ARK5-knockdown LX-2 cells treated with or without TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) for 48 h. (B)
  Representative Western blot for phosphorylated and total Smad2/3 in control and
  ARK5-knockdown LX-2 cells treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) for 30 min. (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining for ARK5 (green) and phosphorylated Smad2/3 (red) in LX-2 in indicated
  groups. Cells were treated with or without TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) for 6 h before analysis.
  Scale bar, 25 μm. (D) Western blot for ARK5, TβRI and Smad4 in control and ARK5-knockdown
  LX-2 cells. Mean ± SD (n = 3 per group), ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus siControl
  group. ###p < 0.001, ##p < 0.01 versus siControl + TGF-β1 group. ACTA2, actin alpha
  2; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1;
  TβRI, Transforming growth factor-beta receptor type I.'
