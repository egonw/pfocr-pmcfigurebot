caption: The implication of NF-κB signaling pathway in inflammation. The inflammatory
  stimulation of a cell may lead to IKK phosphorylation and activation which, in turn,
  may lead to the phosphorylation of the IκB/NF-κB complex retained in the cytoplasm.
  The IκB is degraded by the proteasome, while the NF-κB transcription factor can
  enter into the nucleus and bind DNA to initiate the transcription of some targeted
  genes implicated in the inflammatory response.
