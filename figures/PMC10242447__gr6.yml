caption: TIG association with sepsis disease(A and B) Upregulated genes in TM1 were
  all enriched in downregulated genes of macrophage activation-like syndrome (MALS)
  and immune paralysis patients compared with healthy controls. Enrichment analysis
  using enriched genes identified from MALS and immune paralysis (A), which were upregulated
  in TM1 but downregulated in patients, separately, are summarized in (B). IFN-γ responses
  and inflammatory responses were significantly enriched in both patients.(C) Downregulated
  genes in TM1 were enriched in upregulated genes in patients in immune paralysis
  and MALS patients compared with healthy controls. The same result was also detected
  in ICU-SEPSIS patients from the second cohort.(D) In two independent sepsis cohorts,
  we observed that upregulated genes in TM4 are enriched in upregulated genes in both
  immune paralysis and ICU-SEPSIS patients compared with healthy controls.(E) Pathway
  enrichment analysis using enriched genes from (C) and (D) showed genes that were
  upregulated in TM1 and downregulated in TM4, but upregulated in patients (compared
  with healthy controls), were all enriched in the complement pathway. These analyses
  may indicate the balance between TM1 and TM4.
