caption: A schematic that summarizes the flow of signals from initial kidney damage
  to the suppression of menin/MLL1 expression, the expression of HGF‐Adamts5 and the
  activation of multiple signalling pathways involved in kidney fibrosis
article_title: Loss of MEN1 leads to renal fibrosis and decreases HGF‐Adamts5 pathway
  activity via an epigenetic mechanism.
