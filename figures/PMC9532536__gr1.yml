caption: CuB impaired CM cells proliferation and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest. (A)
  and (B) represent flow cytometry analysis after treatment of CRMM2 cells with DMSO
  vehicle or CuB (0.1 and 0.2 μmol/L) for 24 h. Data are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3)
  and compared using two-way ANOVA. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. (A) Cell
  cycle analysis. (B) Cell apoptosis measurement. (C) Immunoblotting of proteins involved
  in cell cycle in CM cells and HL7702 cells (n = 3). Data are representative of at
  least three independent experiments.
