caption: The Golgi stress response. Pathways involving the transcription factor E3
  (TFE3), mucin, proteoglycan, heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), cAMP responsive element
  binding protein 3 (CREB3) and the protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) have
  been identified. The sensors for TFE3, mucin, proteoglycan and HSP47 have not yet
  been identified. The transcription factors for the mucin, proteoglycan and HSP47
  pathways are also not well characterized. In the TFE3 pathway, dephosphorylation
  of TFE3 causes its nuclear translocation, where it activates transcription of its
  target genes by interacting with the Golgi apparatus stress response element (GASE)
  enhancer element. The mucin pathway, which is activated in response to insufficiency
  of mucin glycosylation, displays crosstalk with the TFE3 pathway. The mucin-type
  Golgi stress response element (MGSE) is present on the promoter of the TFE3 gene
  as well. The proteoglycan pathway involves the ER-localized CREB3 (which functions
  as a sensor for Golgi stress) translocating from the ER to the Golgi to be cleaved
  by S1P and S2P proteases. The cytosolic region of the truncated CREB3 migrates to
  the nucleus and activates transcription of ARF4, leading to apoptosis. In the HSP47
  pathway, expression of HSP47 (an ER chaperone involved in collagen folding and maturation)
  inhibits Golgi stress-induced apoptosis. The PERK pathway acts via the eIF2α/ATF4
  axis, however, BiP/GRP78 is not induced when this pathway is activated by Golgi
  stress.
