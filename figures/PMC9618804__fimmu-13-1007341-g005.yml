caption: Ingredients in GXNI that bind to CXCR1. Structural-based binding prediction
  of GXNI ingredients to CXCR1 by molecular docking. (A) The score of -CDOCKER ENERGY
  of ingredients in GXNI combined with CXCRI. CETSA and ITDRFCETSA were utilized to
  assess the binding between GXNI or DSS and CXCR1 in thermodynamic levels. (B, C)
  WB blots of CETSA and ITDRFCETSA. (D, E) The curve of CETSA and ITDRFCETSA. (F)
  Danshensu-CXCRI interaction is depicted by active binding site (3D & 2D model).
article_title: CXCR1 and its downstream NF-κB inflammation signaling pathway as a
