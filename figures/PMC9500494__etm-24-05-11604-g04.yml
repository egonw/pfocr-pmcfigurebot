caption: Western blot analysis was used to measure the protein expression levels of
  proteins in various signaling pathways regulated by IMPA2. (A) The SKOV3 and ES-2
  cells transfected with shCtrl and shIMPA2 were analyzed using western blot analysis
  with the indicated antibodies. GAPDH was used as the internal control. (B) The quantified
  results of the western blot analysis. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. shCtrl.
  IMPA2, inositol monophosphatase 2; sh, short hairpin; Ctrl, control.
article_title: Inositol monophosphatase 2 promotes epithelial ovarian cancer cell
  proliferation and migration by regulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
