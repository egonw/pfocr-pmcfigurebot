caption: KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed correlated Phosphoproteins.
  Differentially expressed phosphoproteins (CLP + H2 vs. CLP mice, p < 0.05, one‐sample
  t‐test) were subjected to DAVID online pathway analysis. (A)The KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of proteomics and phosphorylomic is shown. (B)The top 20 KEGG pathways
  are listed (FDR < 0.05). The X‐axis indicates the number of proteins, with the corresponding
  KEGG pathway marked on the y‐axis.
