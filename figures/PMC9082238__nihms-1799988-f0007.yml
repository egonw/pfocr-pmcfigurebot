figure_title: Initiator caspases can act as tumor suppressors in an open-wound-like
  EJS tumor by negatively regulating the JNK pathway
caption: Diagrams indicating the signaling profile, tumor size, and hemocyte interactions
  in EJS (left) and caspase-deficient EJS tumors (right). The Upd positive feedback
  loop reinforced by the absence of caspase activity (thicker red arrows) promotes
  JNK signaling, hemocyte proliferation, and tumor growth.
article_title: Non-apoptotic activation of Drosophila caspase-2/9 modulates JNK signaling,
  the tumor microenvironment, and growth of wound-like tumors.
