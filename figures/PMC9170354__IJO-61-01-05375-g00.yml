caption: CAF-induced resistance to 5-FU in GC cells. (A) GC cells were co-cultured
  with fibroblast culture-conditioned media and treated with 5-FU and the IC50 value
  was determined. (B) Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of the indicated
  proteins following 5-FU treatment with and without co-culture with CAFs in various
  GC cell lines. (C) Representative photomicrograph demonstrating the morphological
  changes in GC cells following 5-FU treatment for 72 h co-culture with or without
  CAFs. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; GC, gastric cancer.
  Scale bar, 200 Âµm.
