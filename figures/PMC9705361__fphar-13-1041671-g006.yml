caption: 'CP-25 suppressed ROS influenced MAPK pathway activation and NF-κB nuclear
  translocation in RAW264.7 cells. (A) Representative immunoblotting bands of p-JNK,
  p-ERK and p-p38 in ConA-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Data were expressed as-fold change
  relative to the control group, which was assigned as a value of 1. (B) NF-κB nuclear
  colocalization in CP-25-administrated RAW264.7 cell was analyzed by image flow cytometry,
  and representative images were shown including brightfield, NF-κB (red), nucleus
  (purple), and merged images (Scale bars = 10 μm), and statistic results were shown.
  **p < 0.01 versus control, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 versus ConA. Data were expressed
  as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.'
