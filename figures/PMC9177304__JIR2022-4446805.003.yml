caption: CYP1A1 in tryptophan signaling can be regulated by ZNF165. (a) ZNF165 knockdown
  was achieved in Bel7402 cells by transducing short hairpin RNA targeting ZNF165
  (sh-ZNF165-1/2), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using array
  assay. DEGs were applied for signaling pathway enrichment annotation. (b, c) ZNF165
  knockdown or overexpression was achieved in Bel7402 and HCCLM3 cells by transducing
  sh-ZNF165-1/2 or ZNF165-overexpressing plasmid (OE-ZNF165), and the mRNA expression
  of the tryptophan pathway-related genes AhR, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 was determined using
  qRT-PCR.
