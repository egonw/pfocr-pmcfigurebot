caption: Canonical pathways and upstream regulators between Study 1 and Study 2 in
  wild-type (WT) rats support changes in environmental stress between the two studies.
  The top canonical pathway in WT rats was the superpathway for cholesterol biosynthesis,
  although some genes had connection to the myelination signaling pathway. Notably,
  there is predicted activation of sterol regulatory element-binding factors 1 and
  2 (SREBF1, SREBF2), which have sterol sensing functions. Red and green indicate
  up- and down-regulated genes in the dataset, respectively. Orange and blue indicate
  IPA predictions of activity, where orange indicates predicted activation while blue
  indicates predicted inhibition. Correspondingly, orange arrows suggest activation
  while blue arrows suggest inhibition; yellow arrows indicate that the prediction
  is inconsistent with the state of the downstream molecule.
