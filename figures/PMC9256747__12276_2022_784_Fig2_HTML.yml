figure_title: The molecular mechanisms underlying suicidal NETosis and vital NETosis
caption: Suicidal NETosis (top). PKC and ROS play pivotal roles in suicidal NETosis.
  PKC can be activated directly by PMA or indirectly by A23187 and antibodies that
  increase Ca2+ in the cytoplasm. PKC can also be activated through the FPR-PLC-DAG
  signaling pathway. Activated PKC facilitates NOX-driven ROS production through the
  RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. ROS production can be stimulated by IL-8, which activates NF-ÎºB
  and in turn induces the production of iNOS and COX2 by ROS. Subsequently, ROS induces
  the release of neutrophil enzymes from azurophilic granules and activates PAD4 by
  inducing thioredoxin (TRX). Ca2+ also contributes to the activation of PAD4. Activated
  PAD4 catalyzes the citrullination of histones, leading to chromatin decondensation.
  Finally, the chromatin threads and neutrophil enzymes form NETs in the cytoplasm,
  and neutrophils release NETs through membrane rupture. Vital NETosis (bottom). This
  process is mainly mediated by Ca2+ but is independent of ROS. The cytoplasmic level
  of Ca2+ can be elevated through diverse pathways, such as TLR2, TLT4, and the complement
  receptor. The Ca2+ elevation stimulates PAD4, which sequentially provokes histone
  citrullination, histone decondensation, and NET formation. As NETs are stored within
  vesicles, neutrophils can release them without membrane rupture.
