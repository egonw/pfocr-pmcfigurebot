caption: Metabolomic analysis of the BEAS-2B cells exposed to different types of CeO2
  NPs (high dose, 25 Î¼g/mL). (A) Volcano plots of the significantly altered metabolic
  features between CeO2 NP treated and untreated (CTRL) cells (n=6 per group). (B)
  Heat maps of differentially expressed metabolites between CeO2 NP treated and untreated
  cells (n=6 per group). (C) The number of identified metabolites with significant
  changes between CeO2 NP treated and untreated cells. (D) The number of commonly
  and differentially altered metabolites in the BEAS-2B cells treated with different
  types of CeO2 NPs.
