caption: Pb exposure induced apoptosis in primary hippocampal neurons. a-c Primary
  hippocampal neurons were treated with increased concentrations of PbAc for 24 h.
  a Cell viability was determined with CCK8. b Neuronal apoptotic rate was determined
  by flow cytometry analysis. Early apoptotic cells (AV+/PI ) are shown in the lower
  right quadrant and late apoptotic cells (AV+/PI+) in upper right quadrant. c Protein
  levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-xL were determined by western blotting.
  The protein expression was normalized by GAPDH or corresponding total protein content.
  * P < 0.05 and * * P < 0.01, compared to the control group.

  neuronal apoptosis by suppressing the activation of the IP3R-Ca2+-ASK1-p38 signaling
