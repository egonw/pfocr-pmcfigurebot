caption: 'Gene mapping of meta-analysis results. (a) Three gene mapping strategies
  for the index SNP and credible SNPs of each locus. We mapped these SNPs to the protein-coding
  genes within 10 kb, mapped cis-eQTL markers to their target genes, and mapped the
  SNPs in the genomic regions interacting with gene promoter regions to corresponding
  genes. (b) GO pathway enrichment for pleiotropic versus non-pleiotropic loci. This
  network shows the terms with P < 0.01, a minimum gene count of 3, and an enrichment
  factor > 1.5. The nodes sizes are scaled with P-value. The genes implicated in pleiotropic
  loci are most significantly enriched in eye development and neuron differentiation.
  (c) GTEx tissue-specific enrichment results for 37 loci associated with at least
  one ocular disease. 55 GTEx tissues were classified as 10 categories, and the retina
  were coloured in dark blue. The red dotted line represents the P-value threshold
  after Bonferroni correction (P = 0.05/55 = 9.09 × 10−4). Genomic risk loci show
  significant enrichment in genes specifically expressed in retina. (d) Retinal development
  RNA-seq data from 4.7 PCW to adult was used to plot the normalized expression of
  34 genes of pleiotropic loci and 18 genes of non-pleiotropic loci with significant
  expression variation during development. (e) Left: cell classes marked on scVis
  map. Arrows represents developmental trajectories. Right: ScVis map displays the
  expression trajectories of candidate genes during the development of retinal organoids.
  The genes implicated in pleiotropic loci highly expressed in multipotent progenitors,
  GCs, HCs, cones, rods, MCs, and RPEs, successively, whereas the genes mapped to
  non-pleiotropic loci only had high expression in cones and rods.'
