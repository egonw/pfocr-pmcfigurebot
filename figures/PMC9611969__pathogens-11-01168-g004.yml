caption: Antiviral enhancement relies on oxidative phosphorylation. (A) ISG54 and
  56 expressions were assessed by RT-qPCR following a 24-h stimulation of A549Dual
  either grown in glucose 2 g·L−1 or galactose 2 g·L−1 using PIC 0.25 µg·mL−1, rotenone
  1 µg·mL−1, or both. Relative gene expression was obtained using RNA Polymerase II
  as a housekeeping gene. Fold change results were obtained following normalization
  with relative gene expression of non-treated cells. (B) Analysis of IRF pathway
  activation in A549Dual either grown in glucose 2 g·L−1 or galactose 2 g·L−1 following
  stimulation with PIC 0.25 µg·mL−1, rotenone 1 µg·mL−1, or both. Activity of secreted
  Lucia luciferase was measured using QUANTI-Luc substrate 24 h after treatment. Results
  are expressed as a fold change of luminescence intensity between control cells and
  treated cells. Error bars represent standard errors of three independent experiments.
  Error bars represent standard errors of three independent experiments. ns = not
  significant; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; **** p < 0.0001.
