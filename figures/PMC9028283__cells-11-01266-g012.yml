caption: Diagrammatic Illustration of the molecular mechanism governing the bimodal
  effect of ROS responsible for cellular response in response to oxidative stress.
  Mild to moderate oxidative stress regulates the Nrf2 at physiological level while
  excessive oxidative stress aberrantly accumulates the Nrf2 into nucleus. Physiological
  regulations of Nrf2 activates its target antioxidant genes transcription and expression
  by binding to antioxidant response element (ARE) sites present in the regulatory
  region of antioxidant genes and maintain the cellular ROS homeostasis which leads
  to beneficial cell signaling. At higher levels of oxidative stress, aberrant accumulations
  of Nrf2 in nucleus, paradoxically activated Klf9 transcription by binding to its
  ARE sites present in Klf9 gene promoter, and this aberrant Klf9 expression repressed
  some of the antioxidant genes, such as Prdx6. Finally, these phenomena result in
  Klf9 abundance-dependent increased ROS amplification, and subsequent cell injuries/death
  at least in part by transcriptional suppression of Prdx6. Taken together, our data
  demonstrate that Nrf2-Klf9-Prdx6-axis can play a role in determining ROS-mediated
  signaling pathway and biological response(s) in conditions of oxidative stress.
