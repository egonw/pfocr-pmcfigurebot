caption: Schematic representation of RGS3 isoforms, domains and encoded protein. Asterisks
  depict the position of the variant detected in family PSYAK2. Longer mRNA transcripts
  encode proteins that are predicted to localize to the cytosol or associate with
  the plasma membrane. Shorter, N-terminally truncated forms may be nuclear. Black
  boxes indicate noncoding exons. (A) RGS3 isoform NM_144488.8 encodes the protein
  with the highest molecular weight, consisting of 1198 amino acids. (B) RGS3 isoform
  NM_001282923.2 contains 22 exons with the variant c.649C > T within exon 4. (C)
  RGS3 isoform NM_17790.6 encodes a truncated protein. (D) RGS3 isoform NM_1276261.2
  lacks exons encoding plasma membrane or cytoplasmic domains. (E) RGS3 isoform NM_1276260.2
  encodes a protein that is N-terminally truncated. (F) RGS3 isoform NM_144490.4 is
  the shortest isoform. (G) Schematic representation of RGS3 isoform NP_652759.4 showing
  different domains. The c.649C > T, p.(Arg217Cys) variant is within the C2 domain,
  which is involved in Ca+2-dependent translocation of the RGS3 protein. (H) RGS3
  inhibits the G-protein-mediated postreceptor signalling pathway. The C2 domain at
  the N-terminal translocates RGS3 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, whereas
  the PDZ domain interacts with neuroligin and AMPAR GluR2, which further binds with
  EphrinB2. After translocation to the plasma membrane, the RGS domain of RGS3 interacts
  with the heterotrimeric G-proteins, which are composed of α, β and γ subunits. G-protein-coupled
  receptors activate guanylyl cyclase, which converts GMP to cGMP. It activates adenylyl
  cyclase to convert cAMP to AMP and activates multiple cytoplasmic proteins, including
  PED1C. The ligand binds with the ET-1 receptor and activates MAP kinase via cleavage
  of PIP2 to IP3 (left side). IP3 induces the uptake of Ca+2 through protein kinase
  C. PED1C inhibits protein kinase C and reduces intracellular Ca+2 by deterring the
  ET-1 signalling pathway. AMP = adenosine monophosphate; AMPAR = α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor; cAMP = cyclic AMP; cGMP = cyclic GMP; ET-1 = endothelin-1; GAP =
  GTPase activating protein; GDP = guanosine diphosphate; GEF = guanidine exchange
  factor; GMP = guanosine monophosphate; GTP = guanosine triphosphate; IP3 = inositol
  triphosphate; MAP = mitogen-activated protein; PDE1C = calmodulin dependent cyclic
  nucleotide phosphodiesterase; PIP2 = phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
