caption: 'Effects of sRLX on LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways.
  A, Expression of IκB mRNA analyzed with RT-PCR. The statistical result of IκB mRNA
  expression. B, Expression of p-IκB detected with western blot. C, Statistical result
  of expression of p-IκB proteins. D, Expression of P65 mRNA analyzed with RT-PCR.
  The statistical result of P65 mRNA expression. E, Expression of p65 detected with
  western blot. F, Statistical result of expression of p65 proteins. G, Expression
  of PPAR-γ mRNA analyzed with RT-PCR. The statistical result of PPAR-γ mRNA expression.
  H, Expression of PPAR-γ detected with western blot. I, Statistical result of expression
  of PPAR-γ proteins. Histograms represented mean ± SD of relative quantification
  from 5 independent experiments. *P < 0.05 versus control group, #P < 0.05 versus
  LPS group. &P < 0.05 versus LPS + sRLX group. GW, GW9662.'
