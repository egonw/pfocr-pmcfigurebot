caption: 'The initial naive state of ESCs and specific signaling pathways induce efficient
  co-development of the PrE-/Epi-like niche in vitro. (A) High-content screening (HCS)
  method for 96-well plates imprinted with agarose microwell arrays (430 microwells
  per well) in which EBs are formed (each microwell captures a single EB), cultured
  and imaged (2D mid-focal plane). (B) Schematic of experimental set-up, including
  ESC expansion and EB-based primitive endoderm (PrE) differentiation. (C) Top and
  right: quantified yield of PrE-differentiation (Pdgfrα+, left axis) and proxy for
  EB size (2D projection area, right axis) derived from ESCs expanded in naive (N2B27/2i/Lif)
  versus serum/Lif conditions. Bottom: fluorescence images show the nuclei (blue)
  and Pdgfrα-h2b-gfp+ clusters (green) within EBs formed by combinations of different
  formation and ESC expansion media. Bright-field images of ESCs expanded in N2B27/2i/Lif
  or serum/Lif [on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs)]. Scale bars: 200 µm. (D) Yield
  of Pdgfrα-h2b-gfp+ EBs and the number of GFP+ clusters per EB in N2B27 or serum
  media supplemented with or without Lif and with or without RA. Data are mean±s.d.
  obtained from n=4 wells, with each well containing ∼400 EBs. ANOVA with Bonferroni
  post-hoc test (***P<0.001, **P<0.01). (E-J) Dose-response curves showing the effect
  of different soluble pathway modulators after 96 h in culture on the yield of Pdgfrα-h2b-gfp+
  EBs (blue), the number of Pdgfrα-h2b-gfp+ clusters per EB (red) in median focus
  plane (10× objective) and the EB projection area (as a proxy for EB size, green).
  All values were normalized to H2O/DMSO controls. Mean and s.d. values were obtained
  from n=3 or 4 wells, with every well containing ∼400 EBs. ANOVA with Tukey''s multiple
  comparison test (****P<0.0001, ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05). (K) Schematic for
  chemically induced differentiation of EBs towards PrE. (L) Graph shows yields for
  PrE differentiation (left axis) and EB projection area (right axis) using the induction
  cocktail. Low [C] indicates lower concentrations of cAMP (1 mM) and CHIR99021 (3 µM).
  Representative fluorescent images of indicated conditions. PrE inductions in Lif
  and RA/Lif media are shown for comparison. Scale bars: 200 µm; 40 µm (insets). Data
  are mean±s.d. obtained from n=4 wells, with each well containing ∼400 EBs. ANOVA
  with Tukey''s multiple comparison test (***P<0.001). Images in C, K and L are taken
  after 96 h of culture.'
