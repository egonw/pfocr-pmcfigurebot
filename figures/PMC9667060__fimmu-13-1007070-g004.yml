caption: Differentially expressed genes in infected WT versus cGAS and TBK1 knockout
  cells. (A) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes between L. major infected
  WT and knockout cell lines (n=3). Upregulated (fold change ≥ 2) and downregulated
  (fold change ≤ 2) genes are shown in red and blue, respectively. Dashed lines represent
  p=0.01 and dotted lines show p=0.05. The log2FC is plotted on the x-axis, and the
  negative log10FDR (adjusted p-value) is plotted on the y-axis. (B) Heatmaps showing
  the top 10 most up- or down-regulated genes in the infected knockout cells with
  respect to infected WT controls. Six of the shared upregulated genes and 4 of the
  shared downregulated genes are enclosed in boxes (red boxes, upregulated; blue boxes,
  downregulated). Statistical analysis for differentially expressed genes were performed
  using nSolver Analysis software (v4, NanoString Technologies, Inc., U.S.A.) and
  nCounter® Advanced Analysis Software (v2, NanoString Technologies, Inc., U.S.A.).
