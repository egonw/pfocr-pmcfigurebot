caption: 'GBAP1 activates BMP/SMAD signaling under the mediation of miR-22-3p in HCC
  cells. A Transwell assay revealed that pcDNA/GBAP1 alone promoted migration and
  invasion of Hep3B cells, while miR-22-3p mimics or BMPR1A shRNA reversed the promotion
  effects of pcDNA/GBAP1 on migration and invasion of Hep3B cells. **P < 0.01 (Student’s
  t test). ***P < 0.001 (two-way ANOVA). B Transwell assay revealed that shGBAP1 alone
  inhibited migration and invasion of MHCC97H cells, while miR-22-3p inhibitors or
  pcDNA/BMPR1A reversed the inhibitory effects of shGBAP1 on migration and invasion
  of MHCC97H cells. ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). ***P < 0.001 (two-way ANOVA).
  C Wound healing assay revealed that pcDNA/GBAP1 alone promoted mobility of Hep3B
  cells, while miR-22-3p mimics or BMPR1A shRNA reversed the promotion effects of
  pcDNA/GBAP1 on Hep3B cells mobility. **P < 0.01 (Student’s t test). ***P < 0.001
  (two-way ANOVA). D Wound healing assay revealed that shGBAP1 alone inhibited mobility
  of MHCC97H cells, while miR-22-3p inhibitors or pcDNA/BMPR1A reversed the inhibitory
  effects of shGBAP1 on MHCC97H cells mobility. ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 (two-way ANOVA). E MTT assay revealed that pcDNA/GBAP1 alone promoted
  viability of Hep3B cells, while miR-22-3p mimics or BMPR1A shRNA reversed the promotion
  effects of pcDNA/GBAP1 on Hep3B cells viability. **P < 0.01 (two-way ANOVA with
  Sidak’s t test). F MTT assay revealed that shGBAP1 alone inhibited viability of
  MHCC97H cells, while miR-22-3p inhibitors or pcDNA/BMPR1A reversed the inhibitory
  effects of shGBAP1 on MHCC97H cells viability. **P < 0.01 (two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s
  t test). G EdU assay revealed that pcDNA/GBAP1 alone promoted Hep3B cells proliferation,
  while miR-22-3p mimics or BMPR1A shRNA reversed the promotion effects of pcDNA/GBAP1
  on Hep3B cells proliferation. *P < 0.05 (Student’s t test). *P < 0.05 (two-way ANOVA).
  H EdU assay revealed that shGBAP1 alone inhibited MHCC97H cells proliferation, while
  miR-22-3p inhibitors or pcDNA/BMPR1A reversed the inhibitory effects of shGBAP1
  on MHCC97H cells proliferation. **P < 0.01 (Student’s t test). ***P < 0.001 (two-way
  ANOVA). Magnification: 200 ×'
