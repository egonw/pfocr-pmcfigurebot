caption: Shikonin activated the FasL/caspase-8 signaling pathway. Protein levels of
  FasL, cleaved caspase 3, caspase 8 were increased in SHK-treated various ovarian
  cancer cells. (A) KURAMOCHI and (B) OVSAHO (C) CP70 and (D) Ascites_E04 cells were
  treated with DMSO or SHK for indicated time intervals and western blot for FasL,
  cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 8 was performed. The experiments were carried out
  in triplicate. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

  and mir-874-3p/XIAP axis and prohibits the properties of stemness.
