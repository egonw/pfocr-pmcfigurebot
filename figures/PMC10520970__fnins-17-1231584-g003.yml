caption: RNA-Seq analysis of HSP-SPG7 patient neurons. RNA-Seq analysis was performed
  using patient and healthy control neurons to identify gene expression pathways affected
  in HSP-SPG7 patient neurons. (A) Multidimensional scaling analysis was used to visualize
  the level of similarity in the gene expression of the patient and control neurons.
  (B) Smearplot shows a large number of differently expressed genes. (C) Pathway enrichment
  analysis was performed to understand which pathways/gene networks the differentially
  expressed genes are implicated in. Synaptic pathways was FIGURE 3 (Continued)downregulated
  in patient neurons. (D–F) List of genes that expressed lower in patient neurons
  compared to control neurons in the GABAergic synapse (D), Glutamergic synapse (E)
  and synaptic vesicle cycle pathway (F). (G,H) Western blot analysis and (I) RNA-Seq
  consistently showed reduced expression of synaptophysin expression. (J–M) RT-qPCR
  validated the findings of RNA-Seq based GAD1 and GAD2 gene expression. (N–Q) Whole
  cell patch clamping was used to measure neuronal synaptic activity in control and
  patient neurons. (R,S) List of genes that expressed higher in patient neurons compared
  to control neurons in the oxidative stress related p53 (R) and cellular senescence
  (S).
