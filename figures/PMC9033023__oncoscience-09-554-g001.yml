figure_title: HSP90 mediates IFNγ-induced adaptive immune resistance in pancreatic
  cancer
caption: Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment can produce IFNγ. IFNγ
  binds to receptors (IFNGR1 and IFNGR2) on cancer cells, leading to the activation
  of the JAK-STAT1 pathway and subsequent expression of IDO1. IFNG-induced IDO1 expression
  requires increased protein stability of STAT1 mediated by the HSP90-SUGT1 chaperone
  complex. The activity of IDO1 in the production of kynurenine is mediated by iron,
  while the release of kynurenine is mediated by TSPAN5. Kynurenine is a potent immunosuppressive
  metabolite of various immune cells, including CD8+ T cells.
