caption: Direct, indirect and off-target effects of kinase inhibitors. (A). In this
  example, Inhibitor X directly inhibits Kinase 1, and therefore lowers phosphorylation
  of Substrate 1. However, because Substrate 1 is a positive regulator of Kinase 2,
  this also causes indirect on-target effects on Kinase 2 and downstream signaling.
  (B). In addition, if Inhibitor X has direct off-target effects on another kinase,
  Kinase 6, then both direct and indirect off-target effects on an unrelated cellular
  signaling pathway can occur. Distinguishing these effects is a major challenge when
  using inhibitor compounds to study the cellular function of target kinases.
