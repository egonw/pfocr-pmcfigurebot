caption: Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion detected by CCK8 and Boyden chamber
  assay. (a) Through inhibiting the expression of LAMC2 and Lnc_AC006548.28 and enhancing
  the expression of miR-223, cell proliferation was detected by CCK8 experiment; (b,
  c) through inhibiting the expression of LAMC2 and Lnc_AC006548.28 and enhancing
  the expression of miR-223, cell migration and invasion ability were detected by
  Boyden chamber assay. The difference was statistically significant.
