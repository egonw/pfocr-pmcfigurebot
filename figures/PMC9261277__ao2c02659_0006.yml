caption: 'C3G increased intracellular cAMP levels through the β2AR signaling pathway.
  (A) HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with pGloSensor-22F cAMP and pcDNA3.1-β2AR
  and then seeded into a 96-well plate. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle
  (0.1% DMSO), isoproterenol, or C3G at the indicated concentrations; then kinetic
  measurement of intracellular cAMP was performed. (B) Peak values of RLU based on
  kinetic assay in the transfected-HEK293 cells were shown. Statistical analysis was
  conducted using one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s test). Significant difference (****p < 0.0001)
  versus vehicle treatment group on the cells co-transfected with pGloSensor-22F cAMP
  and pcDNA3.1-β2AR. Significant difference (####p < 0.0001) versus vehicle treatment
  group on the cells transfected with pGloSensor-22F cAMP. n = 3. Iso: isoproterenol
  (10 μM).'
