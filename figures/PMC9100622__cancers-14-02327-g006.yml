caption: Statins induce a decrease in 3D spheroid growth and impair tumor growth of
  Ewing sarcoma PDX. (A) Representative images and dose–response curves showing the
  spheroid area relative to DMSO measured with image J software of 4 dissociated Ewing
  PDX tumors (IC-pPDX-80, IC-pPDX-87, IC-pPDX-164, and IC-pPDX-3) treated by increasing
  the dose of Atorvastatin. Scale bar represents 50 μm. (B) Experimental design of
  IP injection of Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) or DMSO in Ewing PDX and tumor growth
  curves and tumor volumes at ethical sacrifice (day 21 for IC-pPDX-87, day 14 for
  IC-pPDX-3, and day 26 for IC-pPDX-164). Values represent the mean of tumor volume
  +/− SD (n = 5–6 mice per group). ** p value < 0.01, * p value < 0.05, determined
  with Mann–Whitney test for tumor volume and paired Student’s t-test for growth curve.
