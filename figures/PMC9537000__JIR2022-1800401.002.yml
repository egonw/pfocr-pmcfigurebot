caption: Effect of the conciliatory anti-allergic decoction on the pulmonary ventilation
  function in asthmatic mice. The breaths per minute (a) and the tidal volume (b)
  of asthmatic mice were evaluated. (c) Pulmonary responses were determined by whole-body
  plethysmography. (d) The lung index in asthmatic mice. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, compared
  with the MC group.
