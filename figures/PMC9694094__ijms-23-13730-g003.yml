caption: Effect of SC on AMPK activation. Immunoblotting analysis for key signaling
  proteins of the AMPK signaling pathway was performed with HepG2 (A); Hep3B (B);
  and Huh-7 (C) cell lysates. The cells were incubated in serum-free media for 12
  h, followed by treatment with 30 μg/mL SC for the indicated time. Expression of
  p-AMPK and p-ACC in HepG2 represents the mean ± SD (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 between
  control and SC-treated cells).
