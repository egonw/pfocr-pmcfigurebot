caption: MiR-126-5p directly targets and inhibits SPRED1, acting on ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway and affecting cell apoptosis and cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs.
  (A) Volcano plot for the comparison between HCT8 and HCT8/T cells. The cutoff values
  log2FC < −1.2 or >1.2 and FDR <0.05 were set to screen differentially expressing
  miRNAs. Red indicates up-regulated miRNAs, grey indicates unchanged miRNAs and green
  indicates down-regulated miRNAs. (B) The transcripts per million (TPM) values of
  miR-126-5p in HCT8 and HCT8/T from histological data. (C) qRT-PCR analysis of relative
  miR-126-5p expression levels in HCT8 and HCT8/T cells. (D) qRT-PCR analysis of relative
  miR-126-5p expression levels in HCT8 cells treated with increasing concentrations
  of Taxol (TAX) for 3 days, with 10 nM TAX for incremental days or TAX removal after
  18 days of TAX incubation. (E) qRT-PCR analysis of relative miR-126-5p expression
  levels in HCT8/T cells treated with increasing concentrations of TAX for 9 days,
  with 20 nM TAX for incremental days or TAX removal after 18 days of TAX incubation.
  (F) Overexpression of miR-126-5p desensitized HCT8 cells to chemotherapy drugs.
  The cells were treated with TAX, doxorubicin (DOX), vinorelbine (NVB), vincristine
  (VCR) or 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) at incremental concentrations for
  72 h. IC50 values were detected by CCK-8 assay. (G) Knockdown of miR-126-5p resensitized
  HCT8/T cells to chemotherapy drugs. The cells were treated with drugs at incremental
  concentrations for 72 h. IC50 values were detected by CCK-8 assay. (H, I) Nude mice
  xenografts models with HCT8/T shNC and HCT8/T shmiR were injected with paclitaxel
  (PTX, 20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally every two days for 28 or 20 days. Saline was used
  for control group. Tumor volume was measured every two days. (H) The change of tumor
  volume. (I) The tumor weight after treatments. (J) Verification of miR-126-5p directly
  targeting SPRED1 by dual luciferase reporter assay. Luciferase activities after
  co-transfecting with empty vector or miR-126-5p and wild-type or mutant 3′ UTR of
  SPRED1 in 293T cells. (K) Silencing SPRED1 desensitized HCT8 shmiR cells to multiple
  chemotherapy drugs. The cells were treated with drugs at incremental concentrations
  for 72 h. IC50 values were detected by CCK-8 assay. (L) Western blotting analysis
  of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase3 and Cleaced-Caspase3 protein expression in HCT8/T cell groups.
  (M) Selumetinib resensitized cells to chemotherapy agents. After transfection and/or
  incubation, the cells were treated with drugs at incremental concentrations for
  72 h. IC50 values were detected by CCK-8 assay. (N) Silencing of SPRED1 reduced
  cell apoptosis and selumetinib promoted cell apoptosis in the chemotherapy setting.
  After transfection and/or incubation, HCT8/T cellswere exposed to 10 μM TAX for
  another 24 h. The flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. (O) MiR-126-5p
  affects the chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells by regulating SPRED1, ERK1/2
  pathway and apoptosis. All data were expressed as mean ± SD, except that the data
  of H, I expressed as mean ± SEM. ns, P > 0.05, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
