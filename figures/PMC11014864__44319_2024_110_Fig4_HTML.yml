figure_title: PRODH knockdown enhances mtOXPHOS in naive hESCs
caption: '(A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for significantly altered metabolites
  between H9N-shPRODH and H9N-PLKO.1 hESCs (upper), as well as H9P-shPRODH and H9P-PLKO.1
  hESCs (lower). The numbers in the figure indicate the count of metabolites enriched
  in the pathway. (B) Heatmap showing differences in TCA cycle metabolites levels
  between PLKO.1 and shPRODH H9 hESCs in both primed and Rset naive states. (C–E)
  Oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were determined by Seahorse XFe96 extracellular
  flux analyzer in hESCs cultured in three different media conditions: mTeSR1 (C),
  Rset (D), or PXGL (E). The cells were treated sequentially with oligomycin (Oligo),
  carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and rotenone (Rot)
  plus antimycin (AA). Ten technical replicates were analyzed. See also Fig. . (F–H)
  OCRs were detected and analyzed in hESCs cultured in mTeSR1 (F), Rset (G), and PXGL
  (H). Basal respiration was calculated as the difference between basal OCR and non-mitochondrial
  OCR. Maximal OCR was determined as the OCR after FCCP minus non-mitochondrial OCR.
  Data information: The statistical significance was analyzed using unpaired two-tailed
  Student’s t-test in panels. NS, not significant (P > 0.05). ***P < 0.001. Data were
  presented as mean ± SD. In (F–H), each data point represents a technical replicate. .'
