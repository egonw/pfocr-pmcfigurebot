caption: 'MaR1 alleviated high glucose-induced inflammation via LGR6-mediated antioxidant
  pathway. (a) Western blotting analysis images showing the knockout efficiency of
  LGR6 siRNA. (b) DCFH-DA probe was used to detect the levels of ROS in high glucose-stimulated
  HK-2 cells of LGR6 knock-down with MaR1 intervention. Bar: 50 μm. (c) Western blotting
  analysis images showing the levels of IL-18 in cell culture supernatant of high
  glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells of LGR6 knock-down with MaR1 intervention. (d) Western
  blotting analysis images showing the levels of IL-1β in cell culture supernatant
  of high glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells of LGR6 knock-down with MaR1 intervention.
  (e) The levels of cAMP in high glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells of LGR6 knock-down
  with MaR1 intervention. (f) Representative western blotting analysis images showing
  the protein levels of SOD2 in high glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells of LGR6 knock-down
  with MaR1 intervention. All results are representative of three independent experiments.
  Data were expressed as mean ± SD; ∗P <0.05; ∗∗P <0.01; ∗∗∗P <0.001; ∗∗∗∗P <0.0001.'
