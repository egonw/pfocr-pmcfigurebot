caption: Insulin pathway epitope expression after treatment with sucralose, with and
  without an additional treatment with insulin or levodopa. Three treatment concentrations
  of sucralose were used (0.2 mM, 2 mM and 20 mM). A = protein kinase B (AKT), B =
  protein kinase B phosphorylated at Serine 473 (pAKT-Ser 473), C = glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 alpha subunit (GSK3α), D = glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha subunit phosphorylated
  at serine 9 (pGSK3α-Ser 9), E = glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta subunit (GSK3β),
  F = glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta subunit phosphorylated at serine 21 pGSK3β-Ser
  21, G = representative Western blots of respective epitopes. Epitope levels were
  calculated from signal intensity and presented as ratio of signal intensity to 0
  mM sucralose/No additional treatment group. Two-way ANOVA (AKT), F(6,36) = 0.771,
  p = 0.5979; Two-way ANOVA (pAKT), F(6,39) = 2.050, p = 0.0819; Two-way ANOVA (GSK3α),
  F(6,37) = 2.487, p = 0.0402; Two-way ANOVA (pGSK3α-Ser21), F(6,36) = 8.721, p <
  0.0001; Two-way ANOVA (GSK3β), F(6,36) = 11.374, p < 0.0001; Two-way ANOVA (pGSK3β-Ser
  9), F(6,36) = 4.808, p = 0.0010; post HOC test Tukey HSD with p-value set at p <
  0.05. Groups bearing the same letter above the graph are not statistically different.
