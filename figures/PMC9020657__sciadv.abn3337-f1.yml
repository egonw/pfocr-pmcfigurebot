figure_title: Reconstitution of the COP1-SPA41–464-UVR8–mediated UV-B signaling pathway
caption: '(A) A schematic diagram of the core UVR8 photocycle. UVR8 exists as homodimers
  in the absence of UV-B. Upon UV-B exposure, homodimeric UVR8 converts to active
  monomer. Activated monomeric UVR8 interacts with the E3 ligase COP1-SPA complex,
  competitively inhibits the degradation of its target proteins, such as HY5, and
  induces downstream UV-B signaling. RUP1 and RUP2 (represented by RUP) directly interact
  with UVR8 to facilitate its redimerization and inactivation. For simplicity, the
  schematic drawing of COP1-SPA represents the oligomeric form of the complex. (B)
  Reconstitution of the COP1-SPA41–464-UVR8 complex is indicated by a representative
  gel filtration chromatography (pink lines). Lines in blue, dark, gray, and purple
  are representative gel filtration chromatography for the COP1-SPA41–464 complex,
  the COP1-SPA41–464 complex, UVR8 without UV-B treatment, and UVR8 with or without
  UV-B treatment, respectively. The estimated molecular weight of the COP1-SPA41–464-UVR8
  complex is slightly larger than 670 kDa. Bottom: The SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
  (SDS-PAGE) of the peak fractions for the COP1-SPA41–464 complex and UVR8 with or
  without UV-B treatment. (C) Competitive binding assay of COP1-SPA41–464-HY5 using
  UV-B–treated UVR8 (purple) or UVR8VP/AA mutant (orange). mAU, milli–absorbance units.
