caption: 'Knocking down SOX8 inhibits malignant biological behaviors of prostate cancer
  (PCa) cells that are resistant to treatment. (a, b) The viability of DU145 and Enza-R
  cells was measured by a CCK-8 assay after knocking down SOX8. (c, d) Colony-forming
  efficiency of DU145 and Enza-R cells after 10 days of culture. (e) The expression
  of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Zeb-1 in both DU145 and Enza-R cells was
  examined by Western blot. Cells were transfected with lentiviruses containing LV-NC
  or LV-shSOX8. GAPDH served as a loading control. (f, g) A Transwell assay was performed
  to examine the invasive ability of DU145 and Enza-R cells following SOX8 knockdown
  (magnification, ×400). (h, i). The migratory capacity of Enza-R cells was evaluated
  after the cells were wounded with a yellow pipette tip for 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h.
  (j) Enza-R cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of enzalutamide (0, 1,
  5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μM) for 48 h, and the half maximal inhibitory
  concentration (IC50) was determined by a CCK8 assay. ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01. Enza-R:
  enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP cells.'
