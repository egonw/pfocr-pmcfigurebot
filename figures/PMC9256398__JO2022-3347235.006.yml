caption: Maslinic acid induces U251â€‰cell apoptosis. (a) Western blot analysis showed
  the changes in the MAPK signal pathway and apoptosis-related proteins in U87 and
  U251 cells. Maslinic acid inhibits the MAPK signal pathway which promotes the apoptosis
  of tumor cells and exerts its antitumor effect. (b) Downregulated MAPK signaling
  members (log2 FRKM). (c) Upregulated MAPK signaling members (log2 FRKM). (d) Apoptosis
  signaling members' expression change (log2 FRKM).
