caption: Schematic of pathways activating STAT3 signaling. Once cytokines and growth
  factors such as interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and G‐proteins
  as positive regulators bind to their receptors, ligand‐bound receptors undergo conformational
  changes and activate Janus kinase (JAK) family. STAT3 molecules are phosphorylated
  on Y705 by intracellular non‐receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as JAK and RTKs
  such as EGF receptor, or STAT3 can also be activated directly by Src and Abl. While
  PTP, suppressor of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitor of activated STAT as
  the negative regulators can inhibit the activity of STAT3. The dimerization of two
  activated STAT3 molecules binding via SH2 domain enters the nucleus and then binds
  to target gene
