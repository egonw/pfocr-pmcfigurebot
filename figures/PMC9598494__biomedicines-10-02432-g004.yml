caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment of differentially expressed
  genes. Top 20 signaling pathways derived from KEGG signaling pathway enrichment.
  The point size indicates the number of differentially expressed genes in that gene
  class, and the color indicates the enrichment effect. The abscissa is the gene ratio,
  and the larger the number, the greater the enrichment degree.
