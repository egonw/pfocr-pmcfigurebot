caption: EIF4EBP1 gene expression association with breast cancer mutations. Box plots
  of intratumor heterogeneity, homologous recombination defects, fraction genome altered,
  silent mutation rate, non-silent mutation rate, single-nucleotide variant (SNV)
  neoantigens, and indel mutations. Data are based on the scores by Thorsson, et al.
  []. EIF4EBP1 expression is dichotomized by median expression. The bolded center
  bar within the boxplots represents the median, the lower and upper box bounds represent
  the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the lower and upper tails represent
  the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
article_title: High EIF4EBP1 expression reflects mTOR pathway activity and cancer
  cell proliferation and is a biomarker for poor breast cancer prognosis.
