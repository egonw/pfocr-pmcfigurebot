caption: 'Transcription and expressions of SIRT3 were regulated by AdipoR1/AMPK/PGC-1α
  signaling pathway in TBI models. (A–D) Western blot and statistical analysis of
  the phosphorylation of AMPK and expressions of SIRT3 and PGC-1α. (E) The transcription
  results of SIRT3 in AdipoR1flox/flox and AdipoR1CKO mice. **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001
  vs sham group in each strain of mice, #p < 0.05 vs TBI group in each strain of mice,
  &p < 0.05, &&p < 0.01, ns: no statistical significance. (F–I) Effects of AMPK phosphorylation
  inhibitor and AdipoRon treatment on AMPK phosphorylation and expressions of SIRT3
  and PGC-1α after TBI. (J) Mechanism involved in protective effects of activated
  APN/AdipoR1 signaling after TBI. Data are presented as mean ± SD for n = 6. **p < 0.01
  vs sham group, #p < 0.05 vs TBI group, $p < 0.05 vs TBI + AdipoRon group.'
