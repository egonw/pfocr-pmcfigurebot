caption: Rh4 promotes the activation of p53 signaling pathway and ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolysis in HT29 xenograft tumor tissue. (a) Heatmap showing the cluster of differential
  in Rh4 treatment and tumor control group. Up- and downregulation are represented
  in red and green, respectively. (b) The volcano plot of differential expression
  signals in Rh4 treatment and tumor control group. In the enrichment analysis of
  GO and KEGG pathways, the expression of Rh4 treatment group was more upregulated
  than that of tumor control group. (c) The bubble map of GO enrichment analyses of
  differential expressions in HT29 xenograft tumor tissue. The GeneRatio represents
  the degree of enrichment. The node size shows the number of selected genes, and
  the color scale represents the padj. (d) The bubble map of KEGG pathway enrichment
  analyses of differential expressions in HT29 xenograft tumor tissue. The GeneRatio
  represents the degree of enrichment. The node size shows the number of selected
  genes, and the color scale represents the padj. n = 3.
