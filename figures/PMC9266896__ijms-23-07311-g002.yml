caption: 'Mechanism of IL-15 Armored CAR T Cells. IL-15-armored CAR T cells mechanism
  of action. The engineered cells with the CAR and IL-15 transgene secrete soluble
  IL-15 (sIL-15), which either gets recognized directly by the endogenous IL-15 receptor
  or captured by neighboring Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). After receiving the
  IL-15 signal, downstream signaling pathways include the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,
  Ras/Raf MAPK signaling pathway, and JAK/STAT signaling pathway. These three pathways
  together control various gene expressions: upregulating Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl, Mcl-1 (anti-apoptotic),
  downregulating Bim, Puma (pro-apoptotic), upregulating c-Myc, c-Fos, c-Jun (proliferation),
  NF-κB (pro-inflammatory) and inducing the release of TNF-α, IFN-γ (cytotoxicity).
  On the left is a diagram representation of tumor recognition through CAR. CAR constructs
  include CD19-CAR, IL13Rα-CAR, Fn14-CAR, CD123-CAR, GPC3-CAR, GD2-CAR, and CD5-CAR
