caption: In vivo measurement of canonical Wnt signaling activity in hematopoietic
  stem cells and T cell development after competitive transplantation. Activation
  of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway was measured in the Axin2-mTurquoise2 test
  population (Ly5.2) fraction of the transplanted recipient mice by FACS. Quantification
  of the frequency of mTurquoise2 (A,B) for each subset in the bone marrow (A) and
  in the thymus (B). The test population (Ly5.2) fraction not carrying the reporter
  transgene (Axin2-mTurquoise2 wild type) was used to define the mTurquoise2 population.
  Data represent results for five wild-type control mice (wt), five heterozygous Axin2-mTurquoise2
  mice (Tg/wt) and ten homozygous Axin2-mTurquoise2 mice (Tg/Tg) from two independent
  experiments. (C,D) Quantification of the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of
  the mTurquoise2 populations of heterozygous Axin2-mTurquoise2 (Tg/wt) mice for each
  subset in the bone marrow (C) and in the thymus (D). (E,F) Quantification of the
  median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the mTurquoise2 populations of homozygous
  Axin2-mTurquoise2 (Tg/Tg) mice for each subset in the bone marrow (E) and in the
  thymus (F). Data bars represent median values. * p < 0.033, ** p < 0.002 and ***
  p < 0.001 (ANOVA test).
