caption: UBE3D positively regulates CPSF73 but not other C/P proteins at the post-translational
  level(A) Western blot verification at the protein level of UBE3D KO in HEK293 cells
  and UBE3D addback to KO cells.(B) CPSF73 was depleted in UBE3D KO cells and its
  level was restored by adding back UBE3D. Other C/P proteins were not depleted. A
  representative Western blot performed using antibodies specific to the subunits
  of the C/P complex is shown on the left panel. Quantitation of the log2-fold changes
  in protein levels compared to wild-type (WT) using two replicates is shown on the
  right.(C) CPSF73 mRNA level remained unchanged in UBE3D-negative and positive cells.
  Three biological replicates were analyzed by RT-qPCR, and values normalized to RPL13A
  expression.(D) Cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay revealed that CPSF73 is less stable
  in UBE3D KO cells. Left panel, representative Western Blot and right panel, quantification
  of protein levels from three replicates, with values normalized to GAPDH.(E) The
  level of CPFS73 in UBE3D KO cells was increased by the proteasome inhibitor MG132
  (10 μM) and the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor TAK243 (1 μM), demonstrating
  the degradation of CPFS73 was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CPSF73
  protein level with each treatment was normalized to the untreated control from two
  replicates. For all panels, error bars show the mean ± SEM; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01;
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 (Student’s t test, unpaired, two-tailed).
