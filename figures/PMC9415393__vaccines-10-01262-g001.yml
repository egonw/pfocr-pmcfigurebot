caption: 'Schematic diagram of intracellular events in mRNA processing by the antigen
  presenting cells. mRNA enters the cell through the cytosol and translated by the
  ribosome into the encoded antigen. The antigen is then: (A) degraded into small
  protein fragments and epitope by the proteosome, which combine with the MHC-I complex
  at the rough endoplasmic reticulum and traffics to the cell membrane for presentation
  to naive CD8 (+) cytotoxic T cells; (B) either exocytosed to re-enter the APC through
  endocytosis or enters the autophagic pathway. Then, the antigen is split into fragments
  and its epitopes by lysosomal degradation. These epitopes bind with the MHC-II complex
  and are transferred to the cell membrane to activate naive CD4 (+) T lymphocytes.
  (MHC: major histocompatibility complex, RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum).'
