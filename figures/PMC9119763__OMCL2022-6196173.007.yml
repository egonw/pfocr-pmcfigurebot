caption: A working model of fibronectin 1 mediating myocardial I/RI. In response to
  I/R stress, Fn1 expression is upregulated and inhibits activation of LKB1-AMPK signaling,
  which reduces glucose and fatty acid uptake and promotes cardiac mitochondrial fission,
  apoptosis, fibrosis, and inflammation via regulating Drp1-Mfn1/2 balance, TGF-β1
  and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby leading to cardiac injury. Conversely, blocking
  Fn1 reverses these effects.
