caption: 'Overexpression of ATP13A2 inhibits zinc-induced autophagy–lysosome and ERK/P38
  signaling pathways. The ATP13A2-pcDNA3.1-HA plasmid (ATP13A2 overexpression group)
  and the pcDNA3.1-HA empty vector (empty vector group) were transiently transfected
  into HEK293 α-synuclein-DsRed cells, and the ATP13A2 overexpression group and the
  empty vector group were treated or untreated with 75 μM ZnSO4 for 12 h. (a,b) ATP13A2
  levels were detected through Western blotting and quantitative analyses (a, representative
  pictures; b, quantification). Autophagy–lysosome pathway (c, representative pictures;
  d-h quantification): the expression levels of p-α-synuclein (c,d), α-synuclein (c,e),
  LAMP-2a (c,f), P62 (c,g), LC3 I and LC3 II ((c,h), quantification of ratio of LC3II
  to LC3I) were determined using Western blot analysis with β-actin as an internal
  control. Apoptosis pathway ((i), representative pictures; j-n, quantification):
  the p-ERK1 (i,j), p-ERK2 (i,k), p-p38 (i,l), cleaved caspase 3 (i,n) levels and
  the total protein levels of ERK1/2, p38, caspase 3 and expression levels of cytochrome
  C (i,m) were determined via Western blotting with β-actin as an internal control.
  Data are represented as the means ± SEM of at least three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 with respect to the control group.'
