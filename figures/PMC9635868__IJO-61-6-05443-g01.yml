caption: Knockdown of PPP1R14D inhibits the proliferation of LUAD cells. (A) Levels
  of PPP1R14D protein in LUAD and normal bronchial epithelial cell lines. GAPDH was
  used as the loading control. One-way ANOVA, ***P<0.001 vs. BEAS-2B or 16-HBE cells.
  (B) Western blot analysis of PPP1R14D protein expression in A549 and PC-9 cells
  infected with PPP1R14D shRNA lentivirus. GAPDH was used as the loading control.
  One-way ANOVA, *P<0.05 vs. Scramble. (C-G) PPP1R14D knockdown significantly inhibited
  the proliferation of A549 and PC-9 cells, as evaluated by (C) MTS assay, (D and
  E) EdU assay (scale bar, 100 µm) and (F and G) colony formation assays. One-way
  ANOVA; **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. Scramble. PPP1R14D, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory
  subunit 14D; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; sh-short hairpin.
article_title: PPP1R14D promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung
  adenocarcinoma via the PKCα/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
