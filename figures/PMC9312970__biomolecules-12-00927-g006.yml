caption: Effect of MH treatment on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative
  stress-related indexes in the AML12 cells. (A) TLR4, iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, HMGB1 and
  β-actin protein levels in each group. (B–F) Quantification of expression levels
  based on expression ratios of TLR4/β-actin, iNOS/β-actin, COX-2/β-actin, TNF-α/β-actin
  and HMGB1/β-actin. (G–I) The histograms of relative mRNA analysis of TLR4/β-actin,
  TNF-α/β-actin and HMGB1/β-actin. (J) ROS probe fluorescence staining was used to
  detect the effect of MH on oxidative stress in AML12 cells. (Scale bar = 50 µm).
  (K) Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC, GCLM and β-actin proteins levels in each group. (L–P)
  Quantification of expression levels based on expression ratios of Nrf2/β-actin,
  HO-1/β-actin, NQO1/β-actin, GCLC/β-actin and GCLM/β-actin. (Q–U) The histograms
  of relative mRNA analysis of Nrf2/β-actin, HO-1/β-actin, NQO1/β-actin, GCLC/β-actin
  and GCLM/β-actin. Data are presented as mean ± standard (n = 3). NS means not significant,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
