caption: The model demonstrates how PSMA aptamer coupled PBM-NPs can suppress prostate
  cancer carcinogenesis by targeting the Hh pathway. Regulating the transcription
  of the ABC transporter gene, the Hh pathway produces chemoresistance. In addition,
  the Hh pathway involves the activation of SHH, which binds to the receptor PTCH1,
  followed by inhibition of SMO and, finally, stimulation of GLI-dependent transcription.
  The suppressor of fused (SUFU) is a transcription factor that binds to the GLIs
  (GLI-1, -2, and -3) and regulates the expression of their downstream proteins. Modeling
  the binding of thymoquinone encapsulated A10 aptamer-conjugated PBM-NPs to the PSMA
  receptor, expressed on the cell surface, revealed the method by which it may be
  achieved. The aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles blocked the ABC drug efflux protein
  after being taken up by the cell via endocytosis and transported inside (MDR1).
  PBM-NPs inhibit cell growth and modify other features of PCa cells by binding to
  the SHH protein (Singh etÂ al., ).
