caption: Pygo2 knockdown attenuated mesenteric inflammation in Il‐10 −/−  mice. Il‐10−/−
  mice were treated and divided into four groups as shown in Figure  (both n = 8).
  Representative pathological images of MAT in WT, Il‐10 −/−  and Il‐10 −/−  Pygo2
  OE or Pygo2 KD mice (H&E staining, A). Immunohistochemical staining of F4/80‐positive
  macrophages in the MAT (B). The mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators (IL‐6, IL‐1β,
  TNF‐α and IFN‐γ) in MAT were measured by RT–qPCR (C). The mRNA levels of M1 macrophage
  markers (Nos2 and CD274, D) and M2 macrophage markers (Arg1 and CD206, E) in MAT
  were measured by RT–qPCR. WT, wild‐type; IL‐6, interleukin‐6; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1β;
  TNF‐α, tumour necrosis factor‐α; IFN‐γ, interferon‐γ; OE, overexpression; KD, knockdown.
  The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05.
