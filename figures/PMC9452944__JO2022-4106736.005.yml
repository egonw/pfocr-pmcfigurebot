caption: Correlations of ATAXIC scores with DNA damage repair signatures in cancer.
  Spearman correlations between ATAXIC scores and the enrichment scores of the DNA
  damage signature (a), the mismatch repair pathway (b), and the homologous recombination
  pathway (c) in single cells from individual patients of eight cancer types. The
  Spearman correlation coefficients and adjusted P values (FDR) are shown.
