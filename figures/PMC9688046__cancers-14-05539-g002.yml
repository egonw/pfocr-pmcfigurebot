caption: 'Small molecule inhibition of USP7 and its effect on anti-tumor immune response:
  (A) Initiation of p53-dependent apoptosis in tumor cells via p53/MDM2 pathway. (B)
  Decreasing PD-L1 levels sensitize tumor cells to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity by
  reducing PD-L1 interaction with PD-1. (C) Overcoming the immune tolerance of tumor
  via lowering IL-10 levels. (D) Reducing immunosuppressive functions of Tregs via
  destabilization of Tip60 and Foxp3. (E) Promotion of local anti-tumor immune response
  in tumor microenvironment via polarization of macrophage phenotype from anti-inflammatory
  M2 to proinflammatory M1.'
