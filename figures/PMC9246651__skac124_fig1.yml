caption: Proposed model for CCN1 regulation in bovine steroidogenic luteal cells.
  Starting at the top left, PAR1 (thrombin receptor) activation results in downstream
  RhoA activation. Activation of RhoA stimulates formation of F-actin via multiple
  mechanisms, which in turn permits nuclear translocation of the transcription factors
  MRTF and YAP, both of which stimulate CCN1 expression in endothelial and cancer
  cells. In the nucleus, YAP couples with TEAD, leading to transcriptional upregulation
  of CCN1. At the top right, the canonical luteinizing hormone (LH) pathway is represented.
  Binding of LH to luteinizing hormone receptor (LHCGR) frees a Gs protein to activate
  adenylate cyclase (AC). Activated AC generates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
  from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Then cAMP binds to regulatory subunits of protein
  kinase A (PKA), enabling it to activate numerous targets, e.g., CREB. There is a
  possible interaction between PKA and RhoGDI, which would inhibit RhoA.
