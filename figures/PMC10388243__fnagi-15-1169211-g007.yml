caption: PRDX6 overexpression attenuates inhibition of EGF-induced EGFR/ERK signaling
  caused by H2O2. ARPE-19 cells were infected with lentivirus containing a plasmid
  for 48 h, pretreated with 300 μM H2O2 for 3 h, and then induced by application of
  100 ng/mL EGF for 15, 30, or 60 min. (A) Phosphorylated EGFR, ERK, P38MAPK, JNK,
  and β-actin were detected by western blot. (B) Quantitative data of western blot
  results shown in panel (A). Comparisons are among the control group, H2O2 treatment
  group, and PRDX6 overexpression combined with H2O2 treatment group at same time,
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
