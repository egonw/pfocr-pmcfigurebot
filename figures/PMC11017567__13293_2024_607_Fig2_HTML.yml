caption: Most Cancers exhibit sex and gender - skewed hallmark pathway activation.
  (A) Genes with the greatest effect on low (female pole) and high (male pole) TI
  values were identified. Cancer Hallmark Pathway analysis of pole-associated genes
  revealed a predominant polarization pattern involving cell cycle regulation and
  oxidative phosphorylation at the male pole (blue circles) and multiple inflammatory/immunity
  pathways at the female pole (red circles). Gene counts (count) are symbolized by
  the size of the circles and False Discovery Rates (FDR) by the saturation of the
  fill as indicated in the legends. (B) Frequency of pathway skewing is listed in
  rank order of cases involved (in parentheses) and the ratio of involved female (red
  text) to male cases (blue text)
article_title: Treating sex and gender differences as a continuous variable can improve
  precision cancer treatments.
