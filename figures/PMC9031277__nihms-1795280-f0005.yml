caption: A) Ferumoxytol iron oxide nanoparticles modulate macrophage polarization
  in tumors, driving M1 polarization and inducing killing of cancer cells via extracellular
  ROS generation. [Reprint figure adapted from PMID 27668797] B) Ferumoxytol uptake
  by iron-retaining leukemic cells activates the ferroptotic pathway, triggering cell
  death. [Reprint figure from PMID 30911166] C) Titanium dioxide nanoparticles modulate
  endothelial cell permissiveness in microvasculature and facilitate cancer metastasis.
  [Reprint figure from PMID 30692675] D) C-dots accumulate iron content in vivo, triggering
  ferroptotic cell death in cancer cells. [Reprint figure adapted from PMID 27668797]
