caption: OA accelerated the cell cycle of HCT116 (p53−/−) cells by upregulating the
  Jak/Stat3 signaling pathway. A. OA promoted the proliferation of HCT116 (p53−/−)
  cells; ∗P < 0.05. B. OA promoted cell cycle transition in HCT116 (p53−/−) cells;
  ∗∗P < 0.01. C. The proteins related to the Jak/Stat3 signaling pathway were detected
  by western blotting. D. The proteins encoded by the target genes of Stat3 were detected
  by western blotting. E. Effects of treatment with OA on the Stat3 response reporter
  construct, pSTAT3-TA-Luc, in HCT116 (p53−/−) cells; ∗∗P < 0.01. F. The proteins
  encoded by the target genes of Stat3 were detected by western blotting following
  treatment with stattic. G. Schematic depicting the potential mechanisms underlying
  the OA-mediated acceleration of cell cycle transition in colonic tissues.
