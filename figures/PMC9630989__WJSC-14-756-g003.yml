caption: 'Effects of different dietary calcium intake during pregnancy and lactation
  on expression of target genes for adipogenic differentiation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway in adipose tissues among male offspring. A, C, E and G: Expression of genes
  related to adipogenic differentiation in eWAT, iWAT, KAT and BAT; B, D, F and H:
  Expression of genes related to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in eWAT, iWAT,
  KAT and BAT. All data presented as mean ± standard error (n = 10/group). One-way
  analysis of variance was performed to compare the differences among the above four
  groups, and then Student–Newman–Keuls test was used to determine the differences
  between each two groups. Compared to the NC-C group, aP < 0.05. Compared to the
  NC-HFD group, bP < 0.05. NC-C: Normal-calcium reproductive diet and normal-fat diet
  after weaning; NC-HFD: Normal-calcium reproductive diet and high-fat-diet (HFD)
  after weaning; DC-HFD: Deficient-calcium reproductive diet and HFD after weaning;
  LC-HFD: Low-calcium reproductive diet and HFD after weaning; HC-HFD: High-calcium
  reproductive diet and HFD after weaning; eWAT: Epididymal white adipose tissue;
  iWAT: Inguinal white adipose tissue; KAT: Kidney adipose tissue; BAT: Brown adipose
  tissue.'
