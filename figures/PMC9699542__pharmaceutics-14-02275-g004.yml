caption: Crosstalk between different signaling pathways in nanoparticle-induced mitophagy.
  The involvement of nanoparticles in the induction of mitophagy is regulated mainly
  by PINK1/Parkin pathway with the involvement of additional pathways such as PI3/Akt/mTOR,
  ERK/MAPK and HIF-1α. (PI3K—phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt—protein kinase B,
  mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin, ERK—extracellular signal-regulated kinase, MAPK—mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, HIF-1α—hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, LC3—microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B-light chain 3).
