caption: 'The structure of the SOCS protein. All SOCS family members contain an Src
  homology 2 (SH2) domain and a segment called the SOCS box located near the C terminal.
  The SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins have a unique 12-residue N-terminal kinase inhibitory
  region (KIR) domain. The KIR domain plays an important role in the interaction with
  Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway.
  Abbreviation: CIS, cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 domain-containing protein;
  SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; SH2, Src homology 2; KIR, kinase inhibitory
  region.'
