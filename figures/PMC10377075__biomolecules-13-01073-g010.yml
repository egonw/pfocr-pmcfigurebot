caption: Effect of LTP treatment on the expression of EMT-related proteins in PC-9
  cells. (A) WB bands of Vimentin, N-Cadherin, and E-Cadherin proteins. (B) Quantitative
  analysis of protein expression levels. Among them, brown bars, red bars, yellow-green
  bars and green bars represent the control group, PAM treatment for 10 s group, PAM
  treatment for 20 s group and PAM treatment for 30 s group respectively. Data represent
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. “ns” means no statistical difference.
  * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 with ANOVA compared with the control.
