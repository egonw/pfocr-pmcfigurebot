figure_title: RhoGEF2 PDZ and PH domains are necessary for polarity and migration
caption: (A) Unknown RhoGEF2 pathway in PGCs. (B) Schematic of RhoGEF2 protein domains
  and constructs created based on domain truncations and mutations. All constructs
  are driven by a ubiquitous squash (myosin II regulatory light chain) promoter and
  are N-terminally tagged with mNeongreen. (C to G) Representative two-photon image
  of a central plane from PGC clusters expressing the indicated mNeongreen RhoGEF2
  transgene and tdKatushka2-CAAX (PGC membrane marker). mNeongreen-RhoGEF2 transgenes
  are pseudo-colored with the color bar in (C) and are scaled to the same intensity
  range. Cyan outlines the perimeter of the cluster. Scale bars, 10 μm. (H to K) Quantification
  of the indicated mNeongreen RhoGEF2 transgene intensity relative to distance from
  cluster centroid versus WT. Error bars are SEM. (L) Experimental scheme to assess
  domain-specific requirements of RhoGEF2. (M to O) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of stage 14 embryos under the indicated rescue conditions. Genotypes are
  stated below. Yellow ovals mark the gonads. Scale bars, 100 μm. (P, T, and X) Quantification
  of the number of PGCs outside gonads (P), transmigrated PGCs over time (T), or mean
  speed (X) under indicated rescue conditions. Error bars are SD in (P) and (X) and
  SEM in (T). (Q to S and U to W) Two-photon time-lapse imaging of representative
  PGC clusters expressing tdKatushka2-CAAX (PGC membrane marker) dispersing (Q to
  S) or individual PGCs migrating to the mesoderm (U to W) under the indicated rescue
  conditions. Cyan asterisks mark transmigrated PGCs in (Q) to (S), while cyan outlines
  cell membranes, cyan dots track nuclei, and yellow lines are cell tracks in (U)
  to (W). Scale bars, 10 μm. Times are in minutes. Statistical comparisons are pairwise
  from a Mann-Whitney test in (P) and (X). **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
