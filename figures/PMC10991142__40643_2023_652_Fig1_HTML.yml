caption: The designed sub-part of the 3-HP pathway in S. cerevisiae. The blue line
  indicates the glyoxylate cycle. Black font represents yeast endogenous enzymes,
  and yellow font represents exogenous enzymes. The dashed lines mean the conversion
  needs multi-step reactions. The blue color in chemical structures means the carbon
  atoms are from glyoxylate, and red color in chemical structures means the carbon
  atoms are from propionyl-CoA. ACC acetyl-CoA carboxylase, MCR malonyl-CoA reductase,
