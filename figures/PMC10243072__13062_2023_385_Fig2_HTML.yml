caption: 'Five ANKRD genes were dysregulated in NSCLC. A-B Expression levels of the
  five ANKRD genes between NSCLC and normal tissues from TCGA cohorts. C-D Correlation
  analysis between five risk factors expression and stages of NSCLC were performed.
  E The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of five ANKRDs expression in TCGA NSCLC dataset.
  F ROC curves of indicated genes in NSCLC from TCGA database. G Venn diagram analysis
  of 13 DEGs from five GEO datasets of NSCLC. The 13 DEGs were CLDN18, STXBP6, PTPRB,
  PDK4, BTNL9, ADRB1, EMCN, ABI3BP, GIMAP8, ROBO4, HHIP, ANKRD29 and ADAMTS8. H Relative
  mRNA and protein expression levels of ANKRD29 in NSCLC cell lines including A549,
  H1299, SPC-A1, H1975 and H1650. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE as
  control. ROC: receiver operating characteristic; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas.
  Bars are the mean value ± SD. ns = no significant. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ***
