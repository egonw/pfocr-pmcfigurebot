caption: Aging inhibited lysosomal biogenesis and function in macrophages by affecting
  the mTOR/TFEB signaling pathway. The BMDMs were subjected to HR as described in
  the section of methods. (a) Confocal microscopy images of mCherry‐GFP‐LC3B‐expressing
  BMDMs (scale bar, 5 μm). mCheery+GFP‐ percentage was plotted (n = 5). (b) FCM analysis
  of LAMP1 staining. Mean fluorescence intensity was plotted (n = 5). (c) Measurement
  of lysosomal acidification (scale bar, 5 μm). The ratio of yellow/blue fluorescence
  intensity was plotted (n = 5). (d) Measurement of Cathepsin B activity (scale bar,
  40 μm). Relative fluorescence was plotted (n = 6) (e) qRT‐PCR analysis of LAMP1
  (n = 3). (f) Immunoblotting of nuclear TFEB and Lamin B1. (g) qRT‐PCR analysis of
  TFEB (n = 3). (h) Immunoblotting of mTOR, P‐mTOR S2448, and β‐Actin. (in). The BMDMs
  were treated with Torin‐1 (1 μM) for 8 h before HR. (i) Immunoblotting of nuclear
  TFEB and Lamin B1. (j) qRT‐PCR analysis of TFEB (n = 3). (k) FCM analysis of LAMP1 staining.
  Mean fluorescence intensity was plotted (n = 5). (l) Measurement of lysosomal acidification
  (scale bar, 5 μm). The ratio of yellow/blue fluorescence intensity was plotted (n = 5).
  (m) Measurement of Cathepsin B activity (scale bar, 40 μm), relative fluorescence
  was plotted (n = 6). (n) qRT‐PCR analysis of LAMP1 (n = 3). All these immunoblots
  have been repeated for 3 times. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05
