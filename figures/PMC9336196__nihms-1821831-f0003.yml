caption: ALKBH5 regulates DNA damage repair events in cancer cells. A, Representative
  dot plots showing γH2AX-positive cells in scrambled siRNA or ALKBH5 siRNA–transfected
  U2OS cells. U2OS cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or ALKBH5 siRNA for
  72 hours before flow cytometry analyses. Bar graph shows means ± SEM (n = 3). B,
  Western blots of scrambled and ALKBH5 siRNA–transfected U2OS cells using antibodies
  against the indicated proteins. β-Actin was used as the loading control. C, Percent
  of Annexin V-FITC–positive U2OS cells transfected with scrambled or ALKBH5 siRNA.
  D, Results of flow cytometry showing γH2AX-positive cells in scrambled siRNA and
  ALKBH5 siRNA–transfected 143B osteosarcoma cells. Cells were treated with no ionizing
  radiation (IR) or 10 Gy IR. After 24 hours, cells were stained for γH2AX to estimate
  unrepaired double-strand breaks. E, Bar graphs show quantification of γH2AX-positive
  cells shown in D. P values for A, C, and E were calculated using standard Student
  t tests. Bar graph represents means ± SEM (n = 3). F, GSEA showing enrichment of
  DNA damage repair pathway in ALKBH5 KD cells compared with scrambled siRNA–transfected
  143B cells. G, Results of DR-GFP reporter assay showing DSB-induced HR repair. U2OS-DR-GFP
  cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or ALKBH5 siRNAs followed by transfection
  with a pCAGGS vector expressing I-SceI endonuclease or empty vector as control.
  I-SceI endonuclease expression induces DSB if repaired by HR results in GFP+ cells
  as determined by flow cytometry analysis. H, EJ5-GFP reporter assay showing total
  NHEJ. EJ5-GFP U2OS cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or ALKBH5 siRNAs
  followed by transfection with a pCAGGS vector expressing I-SceI endonuclease or
  empty vector as control. I-SceI endonuclease induced DSB if repaired by NHEJ results
  in GFP+ cells as determined by flow cytometry. For G and H, bar graphs show means
  ± SEM (n = 3). P values were calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett
  multiple comparisons test. *, P < 0.05 **, P < 0.01; ****, P < 0.0001.
