caption: Key targets and pathway between the NFD group, the HFD group, and the FV-H
  group revealed by RNA-seq analyses. (a) PCA of the RNA-seq data from the NFD group,
  the HFD group, and the FV-H group. (b) Volcano plot indicating the DEGs (red, upregulated
  genes; green, downregulated genes) from three groups (HFD group vs. NFD group or
  FV-H group). (c) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of crossover DEGs. (d) The
  GO enrichment analysis of crossover DEGs. (e, f) GSEA pathway enrichment analysis
  of pathways that are related to inflammation, lipid metabolism, and fibrosis. (g)
  Heat map of gene expression profiles related to lipid metabolism, fibrosis, and
  inflammation based on RNA-seq dataset. n = 3 in each group.
