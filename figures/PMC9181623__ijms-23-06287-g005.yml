caption: Urinary proteins detected in non-pregnant and pregnant mice. (A) Results
  of the analysis of proteins detected by mass spectrometry in urine samples (n =
  3/group). (B,C) Top-scoring cellular, molecular and biological processes for the
  98 and 88 proteins uniquely detected in non-pregnant and pregnant urine, respectively.
  Network representation and pathway analysis were performed with STRING.
