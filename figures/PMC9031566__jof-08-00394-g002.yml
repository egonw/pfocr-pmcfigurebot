caption: 'Impact of cdc42 deletion on the cell cycle of blastospores and the formation
  of hyphal septa in B. bassiana. (A) Cell-cycle patterns of unicellular blastospores
  stained with the DNA-specific dye propidium iodide after collection from the 3-day-old
  SDBY colonies incubated at optimal 25 °C. Different cell-cycle phases are shown
  as standard deviations of the means from three samples per strain (2 × 104 stained
  spores per sample). (B) LSCM images (scales: 5 μm) of hyphal septum patterns and
  morphology. The presented hyphae were stained with the cell-wall-specific dye calcofluor
  white after collection from the 3-day-old SDBY cultures. Note that two opposite
  types of abnormal septum patterns are present in the Δcdc42 mutant’s culture.'
