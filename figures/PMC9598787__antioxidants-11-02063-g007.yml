caption: Proposed pathways of MMINA effect on the signal transduction of inflammatory
  biomarkers. Cytokine/JAK-STAT signaling and TNFalpha/NF-κβ signaling mainly contribute
  to the manifestation of inflammation. MMINA downregulates the expression of NF-κβ,
  TNFalpha, and STAT3 at mRNA and protein levels and reduces inflammation. COX2 pathway
  crosstalk also activates the NF-κβ signaling and contributes to inflammation. MMINA
  also regulates COX2 expression and inhibits this pathway.
