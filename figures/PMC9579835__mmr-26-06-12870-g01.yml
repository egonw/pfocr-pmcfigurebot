caption: Resveratrol inhibits the migration and invasion of SW480 and SW620 cells
  in vitro. Cells were subjected to the same drug treatments as those used in the
  scratch wound healing assay. (A and B) Transwell migration assay revealing the migration
  of SW480 and SW620 cells subjected to various treatments. (C and D) Transwell invasion
  assay revealing the invasion of SW480 and SW620 cells subjected to various treatments.
  The number of migrated and invaded cells passing through the membrane in the NC-resveratrol
  and si-AKT1-control groups was significantly lower than that in the NC-control group.
  There was no significant difference between the number of migrated and invaded cells
  passing through the membrane in the si-AKT1-control and si-AKT1-resveratrol groups.
  *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, and NS (P>0.05) compared with the respective control; n=9.
  These data were evaluated by one-way ANOVA. NC, negative control; si-, small interfering-;
  NS, not significant.
