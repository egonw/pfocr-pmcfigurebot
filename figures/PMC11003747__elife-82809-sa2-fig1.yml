caption: 'With the exception of Figure 3A &D as well as Figure 7 we have restructured
  all our graphs (specifically in Figures 5&6) to now include each individual data
  point to match with all our other figures. What each individual point represents
  is clearly delineated in our supplemental table (Table 1). For Figure 3A&D, proteome
  canonical pathway enrichments did not have multiple replicates and as such were
  not made as a scatter. For figure 7 we attempted to convert to a scatter model,
  however, given the complexity of the figure, we felt the circles could not be adequately
  seen and they made the figure excessively busy. See  for a sample:'
