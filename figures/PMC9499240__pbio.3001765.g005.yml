figure_title: Pathway analysis of metabolites associated with trained immunity and
  the effect of taurine
caption: (A) Pathway analysis of metabolites that are significantly (p < 0.05) associated
  with the fold change in IL-1β and TNF-α in response to S. aureus 3 months after
  BCG vaccination. Pathway analyses were performed using MetaboAnalyst (KEGG version
  October 2019) []. (B) Linear regression between taurine at baseline and fold changes
  of ex vivo PBMC-derived S. aureus-induced IL-1β responses 3 months after vaccination.
  The metadata on study participants, metabolome, and cytokine data used to generate
  these figures are available at https://gitlab.com/xavier-lab-computation/public/bcg300.
  (C) Human primary monocytes were incubated for 24 hours with taurine (0.1, 0.5,
  or 1 mM), after which the medium was refreshed, and the cells were allowed to rest
  for 5 days, after which they were stimulated with E. coli LPS (10 ng/mL) for 24
  hours. Then, the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were measured, and a fold change was calculated
  relative to the medium control. The median values are presented, and each donor
  is represented in a different color (N = 6, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test,
  ns = not significant, * p < 0.05). The cytokine values used to generate this figure
  can be found in . BCG, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear
  cell.
