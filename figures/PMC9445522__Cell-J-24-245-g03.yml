caption: miR-346 was target of circ_0006427. A. Bioinformatics analysis predicted
  binding sequence between miR-346 and circ_0006427. B. Dual-luciferase reporter gene
  experiments were employed to verify binding relationship between miR-346 and circ_0006427.
  C, D. miR-346 expression in NSCLC tissues and cells was detected by qRT-PCR. E.
  miR-346 expression in NSCLC cells overexpressing circ_0006427 was detected by qRT-PCR.
  F. Pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis was adopted to analyze the correlation between
  miR-346 expression and circ_0006427 expression in NSCLC tissues. All experiments
  were repeated thrice with triplicate samples in each experiment. *; P<0.05, NSCLC;
