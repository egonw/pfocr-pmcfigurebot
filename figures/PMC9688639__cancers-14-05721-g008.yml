caption: Potential regulatory mechanism of FANCI in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
  (A) Expression of FANCI in HCC and normal tissues obtained from the Human Protein
  Atlas database. (B) DEGs in 6 HCC patients. Red indicates upregulated genes and
  blue, downregulated genes. (C) Expression of FANCI in HCC compared to adjacent obtained
  from 6 HCC patients. (D) Expression of FANCI in 6 HCC patients, respectively. (E)
  Role of FANCI in the Fanconi anemia pathway.
