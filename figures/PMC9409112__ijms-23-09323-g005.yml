caption: Influence of red blood cell-derived microparticles on the Wnt signaling pathway
  in HEK293T and HCT-116 cells. (A) Wnt reportergene assay. 24 h after co-transfection
  with either pGL4.27 (TOP) or pGL4.49 (FOP; negative control) with pGL4.74 (Renilla
  plasmid, transfection control), HEK293T cells were incubated with L-cell conditioned
  medium (LCM; negative control), Wnt-3A conditioned medium (WCM; containing active
  Wnt-3A protein), or WCM + one of two concentrations of red blood cell-derived microparticles
  (RMPs; 5 × 106 or 10 × 106 particles/mL). After 24 h, the Wnt signaling related
  transcription of the reportergene was assessed via the Dual-Glo® luciferase assay
  system. Data represents median plus SD after normalization to renilla activity and
  untreated cells (w/o). Three independent experiments (each measured in triplicate)
  were performed. (B–E) HCT-116 cells were incubated with two concentrations of RMPs
  (5 × 106 or 10 × 106 particles/mL), vehicle control (PBS). After 24 h, cells were
  lysed and the protein levels of β-Catenin, p-GSK3β and total GSK3β were assessed
  by Western blot analysis. β-actin was used as loading control. Lysed red blood cells
  (RBCs) were used as negative control. (B) One representative Western blot is shown
  out of four independent experiments (n = 4) (C) Quantification of β-catenin (C),
  p-GSK-3β (D) and GSK-3β (E) levels after normalization to either loading control
  (C,E) or GSK-3β (D) Data represent median, 25th to 75th percentile (box), minimum
  to maximum (whiskers) versus vehicle control (n = 4).
