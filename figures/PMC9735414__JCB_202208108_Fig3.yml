caption: Behavior and EEG recordings of the Kif4Mut/Ymouse exhibit high susceptibility
  to seizure induction. (A–D) The results of the PTZ kindling test. The chart representing
  the seizure stage classification (A) of the individual scores from Kif4WT/Y and
  Kif4Mut/Y mice, before and after the PTZ injection. Statistical analysis results
  of the cumulative number of maximum (B) and all (C) seizure stage, and the ratio
  of the occurrence of stage 4 (D). Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 15 mouse
  pairs). ****P < 0.0001 (Student’s t tests). (E–H) The representative EEG recordings
  (E) and the results of the related time-frequency analysis using Morlet-Wavelet’s
  method (F). Red arrows and star marks indicate the timepoints of PTZ injections
  and the more energetic brain waves representing seizure onsets, respectively; M1,
  primary motor cortex; Hippo, hippocampus. (G) 45-second-long brain waves were picked
  up from hippocampal data in (E). The waveform the Kif4Mut/Y mice exhibited was a
  spike-and-slow-wave pattern with a high electric current. (H) Spectrum analysis
  of post-PTZ injected individual mice using the FFT method. Note that the energy
  levels from 0.5 to 1.25 and 2 Hz in Kif4Mut/Y mice were substantially higher than
  the control; PSD, power spectral density. Data are presented in (H) as mean ± SEM
  (n = 5 mouse pairs). *P < 0.05, ****P < 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA).
