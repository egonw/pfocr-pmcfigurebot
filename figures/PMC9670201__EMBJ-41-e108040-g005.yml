figure_title: Differentially expressed genes between DIS3 mutant and WT samples
caption: Canonical Interferon signaling pathways by IPA. The abundance of transcripts
  that are increased or decreased in DIS3 mutated samples are colored with various
  intensities according to log2 fold change, represented in red or green, respectively.Differentially
  expressed IFN‐related pathways (N = 14 out of 26 tested) between DIS3 mutant vs
  DIS3 WT. Enrichment scores of each pathway were compared between DIS3 mutant vs
  DIS3 WT using a t‐test. FDR is calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.
  Red color dots represent the median value in each group (88 DIS3 mutated DIS3, 765
  DIS3 WT samples), the line the interquartile range.Log 2 expression of 72 IFN‐related
  genes belonging to any of the 26 curated IFN signatures and IPA canonical IFN signaling
  pathways were represented by violin plots (blue, DIS3 WT samples; orange, DIS3 mutant).
  Red color dots represent the median in each group (88 DIS3 mutated DIS3, 765 DIS3
  WT samples), the line the interquartile range.
