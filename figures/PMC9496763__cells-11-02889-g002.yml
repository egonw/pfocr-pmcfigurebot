caption: Major signaling pathways in PMA-activated neutrophils. PMA crosses the cell
  membrane and activates PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, δ) which translocate to the cell
  membrane while some PKC β isoforms are already there. PKC δ phosphorylates MARCKS
  which activates the PI3K pathway allowing the phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3,
  in turn, binds to PH domains such as the one found in Akt. PTEN regulates the outcome
  of PI3K by dephosphorylating PIP3 to PIP2. PIP2 is converted to DAG and IP3 by phospholipase
  C (PLC), leading to Ca2+ release by IP3 and further PKC activation by DAG. PKC also
  activates the MAPK pathway. PKC, MEK1/2 and p38 phosphorylate the cytosolic components
  of NADPH oxidase (p47phox, p67phox and p40phox) which translocate to membranes assembling
  the NADPH oxidase complex in the plasma membrane and specific granules, enabling
  ROS formation. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activates and dissociates a complex formed
  by granule proteins, namely myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), azurocidin
  (AZU), cathepsin G (CG), lactoferrin (LTF), proteinase 3 (PR3) and lysozyme (LYZ).
  NE dissociation degrades F-actin allowing the translocation of NE to the nucleus
  to degrade histones. Moreover, PIP3 activates PKC ζ, which in turn, activates PAD4,
  causing the citrullination of histones. Akt, PAD4 and p38 activate NF-κB, releasing
  IL-1β coordinated with the gasdermin D cleavage by NE, allowing the release of NETs.
