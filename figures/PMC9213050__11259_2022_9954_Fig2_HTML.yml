caption: TLR2 is involved in the PPV1-mediated NF-κB pathway. (a) PK-15 cells were
  infected with PPV1 at MOI of 1, and cell lysates were harvested at the indicated
  time points. The mRNA expression levels of TLR2 were analyzed by RT-qPCR. (b) and
  (c) Silencing efficiency of siRNA targeting TLR2 were detected by RT-qPCR and western
  blotting. PK-15 cells were transfected with negative control siRNA or TLR2 siRNA.
  Total RNA was extracted, and the mRNA levels of TLR2 were measured by RT-qPCR. Cell
  lysates were harvested and analyzed by western blotting. (d) PK-15 cells were transfected
  with negative control siRNA or TLR2 specific siRNAs, then infected with PPV1 at
  an MOI of 1. The mRNA expression levels of TLR2 was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Results
  are expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *0.01 < p < 0.05,
