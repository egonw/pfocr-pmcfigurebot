caption: Schematic pathway of an early and late host immune response against the pathobiont
  C. albicans during mucosal invasion; early recognition of Candida (morphology of
  yeast and hyphal cells) by epithelial cells (neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic
  cells) is efficient through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), followed by innate
  and adaptive antifungal response [].
