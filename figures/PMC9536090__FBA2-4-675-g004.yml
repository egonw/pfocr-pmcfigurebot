caption: Schematic summary of H versus K haplogroups after STING knockdown. The H
  cybrids show higher expression levels of BRCA1, ALK, PD1, and EGFR (Panel A) compared
  to the K cybrids (Panel B). After STING knockdown, the expression levels for BRCA1
  and EGFR are decreased in STING‐KD H cybrids (Panel C) while the STING‐KD K cybrids
  show lower levels for only EGFR (Panel D). Since the H and K cybrids have identical
  nuclear genomes, these results demonstrate that cells with H mtDNA variants can
  differentially modulate the expression levels of four cancer genes. Moreover, activation
  of the STING pathway is involved with expression levels of BRCA1 and EGFR.
