caption: Kindlin-2-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in chondrocytes is essential
  for chondrogenesis. (a–c) In the direct contact coculture system, knockdown of Kindlin-2
  or inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in chondrocytes reduced cartilage matrix
  formation, as observed by Alcian blue staining and safranin O staining (a). Quantitative
  evaluation of Alcian blue staining results (b) and safranin O staining results (c)
  on day 7 was performed. Chondrocytes without coculture were used as the Con group.
  Values are expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ns indicates no significance.
  (d) mRNA expression levels of cartilage-specific genes (Col2, Sox-9, and Aggrecan)
  in chondrocytes on day 7 were detected by qPCR in different groups. 18S was used
  as an internal control. Values are expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ns indicates
  no significance. (e–g) Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in Kindlin-2 OE chondrocytes
  in the direct contact coculture system decreased cartilage matrix formation, as
  observed by Alcian blue staining and safranin O staining (e). Quantitative evaluation
  of Alcian blue staining results (f) and safranin O staining results (g) on day 7
  was performed. Values are expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (h) mRNA expression
  levels of cartilage-specific genes (Col2, Sox-9, and Aggrecan) in chondrocytes on
  day 7 were detected by qPCR in different groups. 18S was used as an internal control.
  Values are expressed as mean ± s.d., ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (i) Schematic of the functional
  consequences and specific mechanism of chondrocytes cocultured with BMSCs in the
  direct contact coculture system.
