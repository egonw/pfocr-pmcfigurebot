caption: BEND5 inhibits Notch signaling via binding to RBPJ. (A) MDA-MB-231 or ZR75-1
  cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-BEND5 or normal IgG, and the precipitates
  were analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. (B) HEK293T cells were
  co-transfected with MYC-RBPJ and FLAG-BEND5 or FLAG-BEND5 △BEN as indicated. Cell
  lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, followed by immunoblot with anti-MYC.
  (C) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-BEND5 and MYC-RBPJ, MYC-RBPJ △CTD,
  MYC-RBPJ △BTD, or MYC-RBPJ △NTD. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MYC,
  followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG. (D) Co-IP analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells and
  ZR75-1 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged BEND5 and MYC-tagged RBPJ. Cell lysates
  were immunoprecipitated with anti-MYC, followed by immunoblot with the indicated
  antibodies. (E) Immunoblot was used to detect Notch pathway downstream targets and
  EMT-related proteins in MDA-MB-231 and ZR75-1 cells transfected with empty vector,
  FLAG-BEND5, or FLAG-BEND5 △BEN. Data shown are mean ± SD of triplicate measurements
  with similar results (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
