caption: GO and KEGG analysis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEM target
  genes and DEGs. (a) GO analysis of target genes corresponding to DEMs. Biological
  process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). (b) GO and KEGG
  analysis of DEGs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis based on identified DEGs (a P
  value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant).
