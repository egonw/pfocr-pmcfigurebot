caption: Silencing CncC suppresses CYP4BQ1 expression and reduces adults’ tolerance
  to (+)-α-pinene. Adults of D. armandi were treated with dsRNA for 24, 48, and 72
  h after injection. The expression levels of CncC (A,E) and CYP4BQ1 (B,F) were detected
  by RT-qPCR. The P450 activities of midgut (C,G) were determined after RNAi. The
  mortality (D,H) of adults exposed to LC50 (+)-α-pinene was assessed at 48 h after
  dsRNA injection. The asterisk indicates a significant difference between treatment
  groups (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, independent Student’s t-test). All
  values are the mean ± SE, n = 3.
