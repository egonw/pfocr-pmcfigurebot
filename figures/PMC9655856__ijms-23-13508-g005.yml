caption: 'IQGAP2 expression levels showed effects on EMT markers. qPCR showed elevated
  expressions of MMP9 and CDH2 and a reduced expression of CDH1 in TCCSUP (A) and
  T24 (B) with IQGAP2 knockdown (siIQGAP2) compared to control (siControl). qPCR show
  reduced expression of MMP9 and elevated expression of CDH1 in T24 (C) with IQGAP2
  overexpression (IQGAP2_EX) compared to control (Control_EV). Bar chart presents
  the means of replicates ± SEM from three different experiments; Student’s t-test
  (two-tailed, unpaired) was used for comparison of means; # indicates p > 0.05; *
  p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, and *** p ≤ 0.001.'
