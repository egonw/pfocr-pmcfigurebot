caption: Restoration of p53 pathway signaling in canonical and non-canonical regulatory
  pathways in cancer cells. Cellular stresses activate p53 pathway signaling through
  p53 transactivation (canonical pathway, left panel). The p53 pathway signaling is
  regulated via p73, a p53 family member (such as by NSC59984), or via ATF4 (induction
  by small molecules such as PG3-Oc and CB002) in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells
  (non-canonical regulatory pathways, right panel). The gene expression via ATF4 or
  p73 partially overlaps with the canonical p53 targets, and some of the overlapping
  canonical p53 pathway signaling target genes (such as Noxa, PUMA, and p21) are crucial
  for the compounds to induce cell death and cell cycle arrest under different cellular
  conditions.
