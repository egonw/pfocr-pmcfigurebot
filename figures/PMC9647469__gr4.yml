caption: GO and KEGG Enrichment Analyses. (A) Three types of GO gene and gene product
  attributes in the database were shown (blue, cellular component; green, molecular
  function; yellow, biological process). (B) GO annotation analysis for the top 20
  targets. (C) KEGG annotation analysis for the top 20 targets. (D) The most correlated
  signaling pathway related to DDT treatment of ICH in KEGG mapper - MAPK signaling
  pathway (has:04010) and apoptosis signaling pathway (has:04210).
