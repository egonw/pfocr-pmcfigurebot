caption: 'NP- and IP-associated co-expression modules and biological pathways are
  highly overlapped. (A) Count of significant modules in NP and IP; (B) count of functional
  categories from NP-only and IP-only modules; (C) overlap of top functional categories
  by NP and IP modules. Only pathways that appeared in at least three tissues are
  shown. Ntissue: number of tissues with the category; * pathway shared: pathways
  were also indicated in condition-specific modules in both NP and IP, i.e., the overlapped
  categories in (B).'
