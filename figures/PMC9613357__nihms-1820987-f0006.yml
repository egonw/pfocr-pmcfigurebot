  after treatment
caption: (a) A dot plot of dysregulated TI transcripts that differentiate nonresponders
  (NRs) (NR1 and NR2) from partial responders (PRs) (PR1 and PR2) and complete responders
  (CRs) (CR1 and CR2) after treatment. Healthy control (normal), CR, PR, and NR samples
  are represented on the x-axis. Log2 expression of a specific transcript is shown
  on the y-axis. The black line reflects mean values in each group. (b) Ingenuity
  network analysis reveals persistent overexpression of type 1 interferon signaling
  after treatment in NRs compared with healthy controls. Orange/red suggests overexpression,
  and green/blue reflects downregulation. (c) Network analysis shows downregulation
  of T-cellâ€“mediated cytokine expression, including IL10, IL1B, IL4, and STAT3, at
  CR2 compared with healthy controls.
