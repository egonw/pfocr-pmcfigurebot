caption: 'High-risk group had a low TMB. (a) The waterfall plot showed the top 20
  frequent mutations that were occurred in GC. (b) The low-risk group had a higher
  TMB than the high-risk group. (c) The mutations of the seven hub genes in GC. (d)
  Survival analysis of TMB in GC. Samples were divided into low- and high-TMB groups
  according to the optimal cutoff value. (e, f) Stratified analysis showed that the
  high-risk group tended to a poorer outcome than the low-risk group in low-TMB cohort,
  but not in high-TMB cohort. TMB: tumor mutational burden; GC: gastric cancer. ∗∗∗∗p
