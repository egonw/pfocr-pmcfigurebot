caption: The transcriptional program in sleep-deprived murine corneal epithelium(A
  and B) M-versus-A plot (MA) plot reveals the differentially expressed genes (DE-Gs)
  in cornea after 2 days (A) and 10 days (B) of SD, compared with control cornea.(C
  and D) KEGG pathway Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of DE-Gs at day 2 (C) and
  10 (D) time points, compared with control cornea.(E) Weighted gene co-expression
  network analysis shows the top 80 DE-Gs interactions.(F) Heatmap shows the expressing
  changes of 27 DE-Gs classified in the module of cell cycle.
