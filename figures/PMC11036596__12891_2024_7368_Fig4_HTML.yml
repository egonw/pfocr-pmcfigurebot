caption: Expression of marker genes within Wnt/Ca2+Signaling Pathway. (A) Violin plot
  showing scaled expression of differentially expressed genes defining the five chondrocyte
  clusters. (B) Differential expression analysis was performed comparing marker genes
  within Wnt/Ca2+Signaling Pathway from NP-degenerative and NP-normal. Stars indicate
  significance level of gene expression difference between two samples by Wilcox test.
