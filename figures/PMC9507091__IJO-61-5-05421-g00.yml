caption: Effect of EA on the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells
  in vitro. (A) Morphology of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells after EA treatment for 48
  h. Arrows indicate morphologically altered cells. Scale bar, 100 µm. (B) Proliferation
  rate of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells after EA treatment for 48 h. Scale bar, 100 mm.
  Representative of biologically independent samples, n=5. (C) Viability of MHCC97-L
  and HCCLM3 cells after EA treatment for 1, 2 or 3 days. At each time point, DMSO
  was regarded as the control group. n=6. (D) Image of MHCC97-L and HCCLM3 cells positive
  for BrdU staining after EA treatment for 48 h. Scale bar, 100 µm. Representative
  of biologically independent samples, n=3. (E) Quantification of BrdU-positive MHCC97-L
  and HCCLM3 cells in (D). (F) Effects of EA on colony formation in MHCC97-L and HCCLM3
  cells. (G) Colony numbers in (F) were quantified. Scale bar, 100 µm. n=3. All data
  are shown as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. EA, eupalinolide A; BrdU,
  5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine.
