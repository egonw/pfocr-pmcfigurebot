caption: Body weight and the estrous cycle in WT and Wnt10a KO mice. Body weights
  were significantly lower in KO mice from 12 to 24 weeks of age (A). Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD. n=7 mice/group. *p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01. WT mice showed a regular
  5-day estrous cycle in the chronological order of proestrous, estrous, and diestrous
  (B). Wnt10a KO mice showed a disrupted estrous cycle, characterized by an extended
  diestrous stage (C, D).
