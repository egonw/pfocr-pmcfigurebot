caption: WEE2-AS1 interacts with RPN2 protein and contributes to GBM malignant progression
  by activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. A GSVA showing differences in hallmark
  biological pathways between the high and low RPN2 samples in the TCGA GBM cohort.
  Scatter plots were used to visualize these differences in pathways. The size of
  the circle indicates the size of the fold change (FC), and the color indicates the
  statistical significance of the difference. The red color indicates statistical
  significance, and blue indicates statistical insignificance. B Correlations between
  RPN2 and the enrichment scores of cancer hallmark pathways in the TCGA GBM cohort.
  C GSEA showing that classical carcinogenic pathways involved in tumor pathogenesis
  were significantly enriched in the high RPN2 expression group in the TCGA GBM dataset.
  D Western blot analysis showing the interaction between WEE2-AS1 and RPN2 in (top)
  LN229 GBM cells and (bottom) GSC20 GSCs. E RIP-qPCR assays showing the relative
  enrichment of WEE2-AS1 detected by RPN2 antibody. Data represent the mean ± SD from
  at least three independent experiments. F RNA FISH-immunofluorescence (FISH-IF)
  assays showing the colocalization of WEE2-AS1 and RPN2 in GBM cells. G Secondary
  structure of WEE2-AS1 predicted by the RNAfold WebServer. H RNA pull-down assay
  by in vitro transcribed biotinylated RNAs corresponding to different fragments of
  WEE2-AS1 in LN229 and GSC20 cells. Western blot assays showing the phosphorylation
  levels of AKT in LN229 GBM cells transfected with (I) sh-NC or sh-WEE2-AS and (J)
  si-NC or si-RPN2. K CCK-8 assays showing the proliferation ability of GBM cells
  cotransfected with ov-NC or ov-WEE2-AS1 and siRPN2 as indicated. L Representative
  tumor sphere formation images of GSCs cotransfected with ov-NC or ov-WEE2-AS1 and
  si-RPN2 as indicated; scale bar, 200 µm. The quantification histogram represents
  the average sphere diameter. Data represent the mean ± SD from at least three independent
  experiments. M Representative Transwell migration and invasion assays showing the
  migration and invasion ability of GBM cells cotransfected with ov-NC or ov-WEE2-AS1
  and siRPN2 as indicated; scale bar, 200 µm. The quantification histogram represents
  the relative cell numbers. Data represent the mean ± SD from at least three independent
  experiments. N Western blot assays showing E-cadherin, N-cadherin, CD44, RPN2, AKT
  and p-AKT protein levels in GBM cells cotransfected with ov-NC or ov-WEE2-AS1 and
  siRPN2 as indicated. The statistical significance is shown as *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
