caption: Oxidative Stress-related molecular mechanisms involved in NAFLD pathophysiology.In
  NAFLD, there is an excessive accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes due to
  (1) FFA overload, caused by increased lipid uptake from diet and/or adipose tissue,
  (2) Elevated de novo lipogenesis and (3) Impairment of VLDL secretion. Excess FFAs,
  specifically SFAs, e.g., palmitate, trigger oxidative stress via direct and indirect
  mechanisms. Organelle dysfunction, such as ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  is a hallmark of NAFLD and further contributes to increased ROS production, leading
  to the activation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, such as the Nrf2â€“ARE
  and NF-kB pathway. When oxidative stress exceeds antioxidant capacity, OxS aggravates
  NAFLD.
