caption: 'Nrf2 signaling and its downstream antioxidant genes are activated by DEX.
  mRNA expression levels of (A) Nrf2 and Keap1, and (B) HO-1 and GPx4 in lung tissues
  were assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Protein expression levels
  of (C) Nrf2 (cytoplasm and nucleus), Keap1, (D) HO-1 and GPx4 were assessed by western
  blotting. Data are presented as the mean Â± SD (n=3). #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. OVA; *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. control. DEX, dexmedetomidine; GPx, glutathione
  peroxidase; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; Keap1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1;
  Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; OVA, ovalbumin.'
