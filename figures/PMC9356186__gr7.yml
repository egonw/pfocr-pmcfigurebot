caption: CDK9i-repressed transcripts are enriched in anti-TNF resistant IBD.A, Ingenuity
  pathway analysis showing enrichment of genes repressed by NVP-2 (defined as log2
  FC <−2 and FDR <0.01 in NVP-2 vs untreated restimulation [RS] cells) in inflammatory
  signaling and cancer pathways. Bars indicate −log10 (P-value), and dots indicate
  z-score. B, GSVA of NVP-2-repressed genes and genes insensitive to NVP-2 (defined
  as log2 FC = 0 in NVP-2/RS) in colonic CD and UC compared with healthy controls
  (HCs). Results for 3 independent IBD datasets (Mucosal Gene Expression Defects in
  IBD [GSE16879], PURSUIT-SC [GSE92415], and PROTECT [GSE109142]). Unpaired Student
  t test. C, GSVA of NVP-2-repressed and insensitive genes in anti-TNF responders
  (R) vs non-responders (NR), and remission (Rem) or active disease (Act) at week
  4. Results for 3 independent IBD datasets outlined above. Unpaired Student t test.
  D, Receiver operator characteristic analysis of NVP-2-repressed genes and genes
  insensitive to NVP-2 in UC and colonic CD, distinguishing infliximab responders
  and non-responders in the Mucosal Gene Expression Defects in IBD data set and golimumab
  responders and non-responders in the PURSUIT-SC data set. E, Correlation of enrichment
  score of NVP-2-repressed genes with clinical parameters including fecal calprotectin
  (fCal), PUCAI, Mayo score, and histology score. Spearman correlation and t test.
