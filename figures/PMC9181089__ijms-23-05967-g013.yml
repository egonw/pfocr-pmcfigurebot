caption: 'Representative photomicrographs of cytochrome C immuno-stained sections
  from the left ventricle of the myocardium in the different experimental groups:
  (a) Group I (control group) showed minimal cytoplasmic immune expression of cytochrome
  C in the myocardium; (b) Group IIa (DOX/Trz group) showed marked cytoplasmic immuno-expression
  of cytochrome C in the myocardium; (c) Group IIb (recovery group) showed moderate
  cytoplasmic immuno-expression of cytochrome C in the myocardium; (d) Group III (prophylactic
  group) showed minimal cytoplasmic immuno-expression of cytochrome C in the myocardium;
  (e) Group IV (curative group) showed few cytoplasmic immuno-expression of cytochrome
  C in the myocardium; and (f) Histogram representing the mean area percentage of
  cytochrome C immuno-reaction in all experimental groups. **, significant compared
  to Group I at p ˂ 0.01; ##, significant compared to Group II at p ˂ 0.01; $, significant
  compared to Group III at p ˂ 0.05; n = 6.'
