caption: Shikonin inhibits the EGFR-induced proliferation of cervical cancer cells
  through the FAK/AKT/GSK3β pathway. (A and B) HeLa and SiHa cells were treated with
  shikonin (2.5 µM) in the absence or presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) for 72 h, and then
  cell viability was evaluated by using CCK-8 assay. (C and D) HeLa and SiHa cells
  were treated with PF-562271 (10 µM) in the absence or presence of EGF (10 ng/ml)
  for 72 h, and then cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. Values represent
  the mean ± SEM. ***P<0.001 vs. the control group. FAK, focal adhesion kinase; SEM,
  standard error of the mean.
