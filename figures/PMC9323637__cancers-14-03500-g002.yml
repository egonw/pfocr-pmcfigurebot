caption: The regulation of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and its role in promoting
  tumorigenesis. Tumor cells generate ATP through aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis,
  with lactate as a by-product. The extracellular accumulation of lactate contributes
  to an acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Mutant p53 interacts with SREBP-2
  in the nucleus and dramatically increases MVA pathway enzyme transcription. The
  MVA route generates cholesterol, dolichols, ubiquinone and isoprenoids. Isoprenoids,
  particularly RhoA, inhibit the Hippo pathway, which prevents phosphorylation of
  YAP/TAZ. This enables YAP/TAZ to translocate to the nucleus and transcribe oncogenic
  target genes. Statin drugs competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting
  enzyme, of the MVA pathway.
