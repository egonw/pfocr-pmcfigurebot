caption: 'Flufenamic acid alleviates inflammation, Aβ, and tau pathology in Alzheimer''s
  disease model. 7‐month‐old female ADLPAPT mice intraperitoneally injected with saline
  or flufenamic acid for 2 months. (a, b) Hippocampal regions of mice were immunostained
  with Iba1. Representative image (a) and quantification (b) of Iba1 percentage of
  area. n = 6 for each group. Scale bar: 100 μm. (c, d) ASC and Iba1 were immunostained
  in hippocampal region. Two images from one sectioned slice were obtained from random
  two regions between CA and DG of hippocampus. The number of Iba1‐positive and ASC/Iba1‐double‐positive
  cells was counted. A total of 80–160 Iba1‐positive cells per mouse were counted.
  Representative image (c) and percentage of double‐positive cells/total Iba1‐positive
  cells (d). n = 4 for ADLPWT+saline, n = 6 for ADLPAPT+saline, and n = 5 for ADLPAPT+FA.
  Scale bar: 10 μm. (e–g) Hippocampal homogenates of mice were used for Western blot
  to measure the protein levels of phospho‐AMPK (T1722448), total AMPK, phospho‐Akt
  (Ser723), total Akt, and β‐actin. (h, i) Amyloid plaque in hippocampus was immunostained
  with biotinylated 4G8 antibody (h), and its immunoreactivity was assessed by percentage
  of area (i). n = 10 for each group. Data were analyzed by the t test. Scale bar:
  100 μm. (j, k) Hippocampus was immunostained with AT8 antibody against phosphorylated
  tau (Ser202/Thr205) (j). Amount of phosphorylated tau in ADLP was assessed with
  percentage of area (k). n = 7 for each group. Scale bar: 100 μm. (l, m) Memory of
  the mice was assessed by the Y‐maze test. n = 6 for ADLPWT+Saline, n = 10 for ADLPAPT+saline,
  and n = 8 for ADLPAPT+FA. (n, o) Open field test was used to measure the anxiety
  and locomotor activity of the mice. n = 6 for ADLPWT+Saline, n = 10 for ADLPAPT+saline,
  and n = 8 for ADLPAPT+FA. Data were analyzed by the t test for (i) and (k), and
  by one‐way ANOVA and Tukey''s multiple comparisons test for the other data. All
  data were presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ****p < 0.0001 versus
  the ADLPWT+Saline group'
