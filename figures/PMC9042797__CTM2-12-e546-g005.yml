caption: 'Changes in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolites in the IFLT and CLT
  groups. (A) Metabolic changes in the PPP. Metabolites are labeled as color‐coded
  ovals. The color corresponds to the p value between IFLT_EP and CLT_EP. Red, increased;
  blue, decreased. (B) Nine of the deferentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) obtained
  by comparing IFLT_EP and CLT_EP belong to the PPP. In the four groups, the nine
  different metabolites were quantitatively compared, and scatter plots were made.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Abbreviations: CLT, conventional liver transplantation;
  EP, end‐preservation; IFLT, ischemia‐free liver transplantation; PR, postrevascularization'
