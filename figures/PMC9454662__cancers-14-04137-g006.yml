caption: 'Hyperactivation of the Wnt pathway stimulates TROP2 in healthy colon organoids.
  (A) Left, qRT-PCR analysis of expression levels of the indicated genes in human
  healthy colon organoids (Healthy) and organoids derived from human CRC. The organoids
  were cultured either in standard organoid medium (ENR), or in ENR medium supplemented
  with next-generation surrogate Wnt ligand (WntSur) at final concentrations of 0.05
  nM, 0.1 nM, and 0.5 nM (WntSur 0.05, WntSur 0.1, and WntSur 0.5, respectively).
  RNA samples isolated from three healthy and three tumor organoid cultures were analyzed
  (each in technical triplicate; the average value of each triplicate is represented
  by a grey or red dot, respectively). The diagram shows ΔCt counts, i.e., the cycle
  threshold (Ct) value of the gene of interest minus the Ct-value of housekeeping
  gene β-ACTIN (the lower the ΔCt value, the higher the gene expression); black lines
  indicate the mean value for three biological replicates; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001. Wnt/β-catenin target genes—axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2), achaete-scute
  complex homolog 2 (ASCL2), leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor
  5 (LGR5); differentiation markers—alkaline phosphatase (ALPI), sucrase-isomaltase
  (SIM); and genes related to the EMT status—E-cadherin and vimentin. Right: fluorescent
  microscopy images of TROP2 (membranous green fluorescent signal) in tumor organoids
  derived from human CRC; organoids with intermediate levels of TROP2 mRNA (ΔCt value
  ± 13, see the very left diagram) were used for the staining. The organoids were
  cultured either in the ENR medium alone or in the ENR medium containing 0.5 nM WntSur
  (WENR). Note that the TROP2 protein expression is independent of the presence of
  WntSur in the culture medium. The specimen was counterstained with DAPI. Left images
  show three-dimensional (3D) projection of the whole organoid; right images show
  one image layer; representative pictures are shown. Scale bar: 10 µm. (B) Left:
  quantitative RT-PCR analysis of expression levels of the YAP/TAZ signaling target
  genes. The experimental setup is identical to panel (A); ANKRD1, ankyrin repeat
  domain 1; ANXA1, annexin A1; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; CTSE, cathepsin
  E; CYR61, cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61; E2F1, E2F transcription factor 1;
  SCA1/LY6a, stem cell antigen-1/lymphocyte antigen 6; TEAD2, TEA domain transcription
  factor 2. Right: fluorescent microscopy images of TROP2 (membranous green fluorescent
  signal) and YAP (nuclear red florescent signal) protein localization in a healthy
  human colon organoid. The organoids were cultured in the WENR medium containing
  0.5 nM WntSur. The specimen was counterstained with DAPI. Setting of the left image
  is described in panel (A); right image shows maximal intensity projection of six
  adjacent layers; the enlarged image is shown in the inset. Scale bar: 25 µm.'
