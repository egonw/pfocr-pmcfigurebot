caption: Establishing the inflammatory response upon spike S1 glycoprotein induction
  in A549 lung cells and THP-1 macrophages. PMA-treated THP-1 macrophage (6.5 × 105
  cell/well) and A549 (at 3 × 105 cell/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated
  overnight, then challenged with 100 ng/mL of spike glycoprotein S1 (SP) for 0–48
  h for A549 and 0–6 h for THP-1 macrophage and the supernatants were collected and
  the cells were extracted for total RNA using TRIzol® reagent. The fold-change of
  inflammatory gene expressions (NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18) in response to SP induction
  in A549 cells (A) and in THP-1 macrophages (B) were determined using RT-PCR. The
  inflammatory cytokine secretions (IL-6, IL1β, and IL-18) in A549 cells (C) and in
  THP-1 macrophages (D) upon SP induction were determined using ELISA. Data are presented
  as mean ± S.D. values of at least three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 vs.
  non-treated control group. SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2; IL-6, Interleukin-6; NLRP3, Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor
  containing pyrin domain 3; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IL-18, interleukin-18.

  Glycoprotein S1-Induction In Vitro in A549 Lung Cells and THP-1 Macrophages via
