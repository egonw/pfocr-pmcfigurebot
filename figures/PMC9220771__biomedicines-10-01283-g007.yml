caption: Dynamics of expression of Notch signaling pathway components and Bmp2/Runx2
  genes in cardiac mesenchymal cells using quantitative PCR analysis. SH—cells from
  a healthy myocardium of sham-operated rats (n = 3); 8 h-MI—post-infarction cells
  from rats 8 h after induction (n = 4); 24 h-MI—post-infarction cells from rats 24
  h after induction (n = 9). Vertical—the relative amount of the mRNA in each group,
  measured by the 2-ΔΔCT method; box plots with whiskers at min to the max are presented.
  The asterisk shows significant differences between the SH and MI groups at p < 0.05
  (unpaired nonparametric Mann–Whitney test).
