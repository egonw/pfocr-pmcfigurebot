caption: (A) Distribution of differentially methylated genes in PAAD. (B) Gene ontology
  (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes. Bubble diagram of GO
  enrichment analysis results and several of the most prominent GO terms associated
  with the genes. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment
  of differentially methylated genes. Bubble diagram of KEGG enrichment and several
  of the most prominent pathways analysis results for the enriched genes. In the bubble
  graphs, the horizontal axis is GeneRatio, representing the proportion of genes contained
  in each enriched function or pathway in the total genes involved in the analysis,
  and the name of the enriched function or pathway is presented on the vertical axis.
  The size and color gradient of dots represent the number of genes and p-value. Small
  circles of the network diagram represent the most prominently enriched function
  or pathway name, distinguished by different colors, and genes in these entries are
  connected by corresponding color lines.
