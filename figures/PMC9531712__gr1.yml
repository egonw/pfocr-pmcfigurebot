caption: 'Canonical and Non-canonical Wnt Signaling in CancerBoth canonical and non-canonical
  Wnt ligands require Porcupine activity for secretion. Canonical Wnts bind Frizzled
  receptors in complex with LRP5/6 to activate downstream signaling by phosphorylation
  and stabilization of β-catenin, which enters the nucleus to activate gene transcript
  via TCF/LEFs. Non-canonical Wnts also act via Frizzled receptors, activating ROR1/2
  or recruiting Daam1 to activate the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways, which can
  activate gene transcription or promote actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. Both pathways
  are subject to extracellular regulation, with R-spondins (RSPO) potentiating canonical
  signaling, and the ubiquitin-ligase RNF43 (or its close relative ZNRF3) and Dkk
  acting as negative regulators (depicted in red). sFRPs may act as positive or negative
  regulators of canonical signalling depending on context. sFRPs and RNF43 can also
  regulate non-canonical signaling, although Dkks have been shown to activate PCP
  pathways, in one of several examples of cross-talk between different Wnt pathways.
