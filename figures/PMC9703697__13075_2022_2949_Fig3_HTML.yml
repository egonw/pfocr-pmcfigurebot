caption: FBXO21 is directly targeted by miR-217 and is a regulator of IDD. A Gene
  ontology analysis showing the highest enrichment scores of the downregulated GO
  terms, including those involved in imaginal disc-derived wing margin morphogenesis,
  ECM structural constituent, and extracellular region. B Heatmap of all differentially
  expressed mRNAs between the sample with IDD and the paired controls. C The target
  of miR-217 was verified by Cytoscape. D Venn diagram displaying miR-217, computationally
  predicted to target FBXO21 by different algorithms. E The mRNA 3′UTR of FBXO21 and
  the putative miR-217 binding site sequence have high sequence conservation and complementarity
  with miR-217. F The wild- or mutant-type FBXO21 3′UTR reporter plasmid was either
  cotransfected with miR-217 mimics or inhibitor into cultured NP cells. As the 3′-UTR
  of wild-type FBXO21 contains miR-217 binding sites, the translation of firefly luciferase
  was inhibited in the miR-217 mimics group. Thus, by measuring the luciferase activity,
  it can be determined FBXO21 is the target gene of the miR-217. G, H The expression
  level of FBXO21 was evaluated by western blotting and qRT–PCR. n = 3. IDD, intervertebral
  disc degeneration; miR, microRNA; NP, nucleus pulposus; GO, gene ontology; mut,
  mutant; WT, wild type; FBXO21, F-box only protein 21. ***P < 0.001
