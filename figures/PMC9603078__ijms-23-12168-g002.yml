caption: 'High-resolution Oxygraph recording examples from prostate non-malignant
  and malignant mechanically permeabilized tissue specimens. Blue line indicates time-dependent
  oxygen concentration nmol/mL (left Y axis,) and red line indicates oxygen consumption
  per second and per mg wet weight (right Y axis). (A) Protocol CI + CII to assess
  relative convergence of CI and CII to ubiquinone Q-junction. Sequential substrate
  additions (see Table 2) indicated. Grey line indicates oxygen consumption per second
  and per wet weight of non-malignant tissue and red line indicates malignant tissue.
  (B) CI + CII pathway, the substrates and inhibitors highlighted in bold and italic.
  IMS: intermembrane space, IMM: inner mitochondrial membrane, matrix: mitochondrial
  matrix. (C) Protocol CII + rotenone for assessment of CII-linked respiration in
  non-malignant and malignant tissue. Cytochrome c was used to assess intactness of
  the outer mitochondrial membrane. (D) CII pathway, the substrates and inhibitors
  highlighted with board font. Cytochrome c was used to assess intactness of the outer
  mitochondrial membrane.'
