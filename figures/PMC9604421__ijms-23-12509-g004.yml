caption: The significance of the Notch signaling pathway in preventing CMC apoptosis.
  Through the transmission of the Notch signal, a decrease in the expression of pro-apoptotic
  Bax and an increase in the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 is achieved. Additionally,
  the prevention of apoptosis can be achieved by increasing the expression of genes
  associated with autophagy. Inhibition of the pro-apoptotic tumor necrosis factor-α
  also helps prevent apoptosis. “Created with BioRender.com”.
