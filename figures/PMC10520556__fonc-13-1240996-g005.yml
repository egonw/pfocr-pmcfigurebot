caption: VNLG-152R modulates transcriptome and proteome of TNBC cells in favor of
  cancer inhibition. (A) RNA-sequencing and differential gene expression analysis
  show that 337 genes were differentially expressed when MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  with 10 μM VNLG-152R for 24h; 259 genes were upregulated (red dots) and 78 downregulated
  (blue dots). (B) GSEA of differentially expressed genes demonstrate inhibition of
  MTORC1 and NUP-153 pathways but activation of p53 pathway by VNLG-152R. (C) Whole
  proteome profiling by high-definition mass spectrometry (HD-MS) of VNLG-152R-treated
  (10 μM for 24 h) MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrate modulation of several pathways. Notably,
  protein translation is inhibited 12-fold apparently due to MNK1/2 degradation besides
  inhibiting other biological processes such as cell adhesion to the matrix, cell
  to cell adhesion and IFN signaling critical to breast cancer progression. Statistical
  significance was computed at P < 0.01.
