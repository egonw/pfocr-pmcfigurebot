caption: Identification of metabolic pathway influencing ERα levels and cell proliferation
  in primary and metastatic breast cancer cells. Robust Z scores (Z*) graphs for siRNA
  oligonucleotides (esiRNA)-treated samples for 48 hours in MCF10a (A), MCF-7 (B,
  D), and Y537S (C, E) cells. The ERα levels were detected by in-cell WB (D, E) while
  cell number was detected by in-cell propidium iodide (PI) staining (A, B, C). (F)
  Venn diagrams showing the positive hits for ERα and PI lists in MCF-7 and Y537S
  cells. (G) Volcano plot showing the differences in metabolic compounds among ERα-positive
  and ERα-negative BC cell lines. Data have been downloaded by the DepMap portal (https://depmap.org/portal).
  Green dots represent the compound considered as significant according to the thresholds
  indicated in the figure. (H) Venn diagram showing pathway enrichment as extrapolated
  by the Reactome (https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#/) database for positive hits
  in either MCF-7 and Y537S cells or metabolites in ERα-positive BC cell lines. (I)
  Schematic showing the initial reaction of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway.
  Red squares indicate the up-regulated compound in ERα-positive BC cell lines and
  the enzyme found in both MCF-7 and Y537S cells.
article_title: A functional genetic screen for metabolic proteins unveils GART and
  the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway as novel targets for the treatment of luminal
  A ERα expressing primary and metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma.
