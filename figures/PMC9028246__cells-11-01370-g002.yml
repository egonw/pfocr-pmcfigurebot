caption: Hippo Pathway Regulation. A variety of mechanisms stimulate or inhibit core
  Hippo kinases including adherens and tight junctions, focal adhesions complexes,
  growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs),
  and the actin cytoskeleton, as well as proto-cadherins of the FAT family. Solid
  arrows indicate evidence of direct interaction. Broken arrows indicate evidence
  of indirect or multistep interactions not detailed in this figure. Please see the
  text for further detail.
