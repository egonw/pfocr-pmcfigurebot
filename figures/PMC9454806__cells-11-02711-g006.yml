caption: Cell–cell interaction analysis of all cell subsets in human GSV. (A) The
  interaction strengths among all cell subsets were compared between diabetic patient
  (P2) and nondiabetic patients. Red dots stand for interaction strength that was
  increased in P2, whereas blue dots are decreased interaction in P2. (B) The plot
  demonstrates the signaling role of cell subsets in TRAIL signaling, and results
  imply that IL6hi VECs were major receivers for this inflammatory pathway. (C) Heatmap
  represents roles of PVR and CSF signaling that were specific to diabetic venous
  EC subsets. Circular plot at the bottom shows the signaling strengths of ligand–receptor
  in PVR and CSF3 signaling pathway. (D) Heatmap represents roles of GDF signaling
  that was enriched in ANGPTL7+ FB. Violin plot at the bottom shows the GDF signaling
  ligand (GDF15)–receptor (TGFBR2) in all cell subsets.
