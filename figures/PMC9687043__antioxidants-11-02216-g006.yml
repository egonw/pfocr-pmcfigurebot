caption: The PKG-1 level and mTOR signal pathway are altered in MCSEKO mice and GYY4137
  treatment reverses them. MCSEKO mice and Flox mice were treated with GYY4137 or
  vehicle for six weeks. Western blot analysis of PKG-1 and mTOR signal pathway in
  GAS muscle. (A) Enriched pathways of KEGG analysis, (B) The representative images
  of western blotting of PKG1. (C) Cumulative data of western blotting images of PKG-1.
  (D) The representative images of western blotting of mTOR signaling pathway. (E,F)
  Cumulative data of western blotting images of mTOR signaling pathway. Data were
  expressed as means ± SEM (n = 6 in each group). ** p < 0.01,*** p < 0.001.
