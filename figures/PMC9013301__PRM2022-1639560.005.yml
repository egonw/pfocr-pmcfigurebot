caption: 'AQP-3 overexpression promoted activation of ERK1/2 signaling and alleviated
  hyperosmolarity-induced apoptosis. (a) Western blotting analysis of ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2
  expression in AQP-3 overexpressed NP cells under a hyperosmolarity (550 mOsm/kg).
  (b) Flowcytometry analysis of NP cell apoptosis ratio. (c) and (d): real-time PCR
  and western blotting analysis of proapoptosis (Bax and caspase 3/cleaved caspase
  3) and antiapoptosis (Bcl-2) molecules under different osmotic pressures (330 mOsm/kg
  and 550 mOsm/kg), respectively. NP-AQP-3 + 330: AQP3 overexpressed NP cells cultured
  in 330 mOsm/kg. NP-AQP-3 + 550: AQP3 overexpressed NP cells cultured in 550 mOsm/kg.
  NP-AQP-3-NC + 550: NP cells without transfection (NP-CN) cultured in 550 mOsm/kg.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD. (A) indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05)
  when compared with the group of NP-AQP-3 + 330. (B) indicates a significant difference
  (p < 0.05) when compared with the group of NP-AQP-3 + 550.'
