caption: Mechanical stimulation of osteoclasts evoked protein synthesis in FDB muscle
  in vitro, through secreted mediators. (A) Schematic view of the Transwell® co-culture
  system. Osteoclasts (OCs, derived from RAW264.7 cells, differentiated with RANKL
  and purified by serum gradient) were seeded in the upper chamber, and the isolated
  FDB muscle was placed in the lower compartment. Osteoclasts were mechanically stimulated
  by gently pipetting up and down (37% of the extracellular medium, ten times) in
  the upper compartment. Protein synthesis in the FDB muscle was estimated by puromycin
  incorporation (SUnSET method, 45 min pulse, 30 min chase). (B) Mechanical stimulation
  (MS+, lanes 1, 4) at the upper chamber evoked protein synthesis in FDB muscle only
  when osteoclasts were seeded (OCs+, lanes 3, 4). Puromycin immunoblot (top) and
  its quantification (bottom) are shown. (C) Incubation with 100 nM Insulin was used
  as a positive control of protein synthesis induction in FDB muscle. Mean ± SEM of
  three independent experiments is graphed. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, Mann–Whitney
  test, comparing MS− vs. MS+ in each case (B) or comparing without and with insulin
  (C).
