caption: ARS96 phosphorylation induces hepatic lipogenic pathway. (A) AR is positively
  correlated with fat acid metabolism pathway in HCC. Shown is gene set enrichment
  analysis (GESA) from The Cancer Genome Atlas transcriptome dataset of 373 primary
  human HCC tumors in high and low AR expression groups. (B) AR consensus binding
  motif based on the JASPAR chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)‐seq database. (http://jaspar.genereg.net/)
  (left). Shown are four potential AR binding motifs in SREBP1 promoter (right). (C)
  AR binds to SREBP1 promoter. SNU449 cells transiently expressing HA‐AR were assayed
  for AR binding to SREBP1 promoter by ChIP, which was measured by PCR (left) and
  qPCR (right). PSA was used as a positive control and a random sequence was used
  as a negative control (NC). Data (mean ± SD, n = 3) was analyzed by unpaired two‐tailed
  t test. ***p < 0.001. (D) S96 phosphorylation regulates the ability of AR to activate
  SREBP1 promoter. WT HA‐AR, HA‐ARS96A, or HA‐ARS96E were transiently expressed in
  SNU449 cells carrying SREBP1 promoter‐Luc reporter. Cells were treated with R1881
  or drug vehicle (DMSO) and measured for Luc activity. Data (mean ± SD, n = 3) was
  analyzed by unpaired two‐tailed t test. NS, no statistical significance, *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01. (E,F) AR activation of lipogenic pathway is dependent on S96 phosphorylation.
  HA‐ARWT, HA‐ARS96A, or HA‐ARS96E were transiently expressed in SNU449 or SNU423
  cells. Expression of HA‐AR proteins was examined by immunoblot. mRNA expression
  of lipogenic genes were analyzed by qRT‐PCR. Data (mean ± SD, n = 3) was analyzed
  by unpaired two‐tailed t test; NS, no statistical significance; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001
