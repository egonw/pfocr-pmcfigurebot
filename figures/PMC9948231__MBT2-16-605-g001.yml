caption: Dynamic control of membrane synthesis gene plsC by the glycolysis flux biosensor
  for improved lycopene production. (A) The production pathway of lycopene. (B) The
  genes that produce lycopene are expressed on different plasmids. (C) The production
  of strains sly01–sly30. (D) The production of lycopene with the pathway of MVA and
  both MVA and MEP. (E) Lycopene accumulates on the membrane. (F) The gene plsC was
  regulated by the active‐response biosensors pS05, pS07 and pS09. (G) Lycopene production
  dynamically regulates the expression of plsC.

  enables highly sensitive glycolysis flux biosensor for dynamic metabolic control.
