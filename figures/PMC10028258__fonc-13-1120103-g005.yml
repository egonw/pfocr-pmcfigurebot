caption: (A) Twenty genes that interact with DACH1 were identified on the GeneMANIA
  website. (B) Genes interacting with DACH1 were enriched for functions such as transcriptional
  misregulation in cancer, TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway, and negative regulation
  of signal transduction in absence of ligand.
