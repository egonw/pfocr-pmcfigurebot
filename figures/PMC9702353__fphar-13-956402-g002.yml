caption: 'FLaAN/C shifted M1 to M2 phenotype in spinal cord of mice with EAE. The
  mice were euthanized on post-immunization day 30. The spinal cord tissue of each
  group of mice were isolated and embedded in paraffin.Immunofluorescence was used
  to detect the colocalization of CD11b with M1 markers (iNOS and CD86) and M2 markers
  (Arginase-1 and CD206) in spinal cord tissue.The representative images show the
  expression levels of CD86+(A), iNOS+(B), CD206+(D) and Arginase-1+(E) in CD11b+
  cells (scale bars: 50 μm). (C) The protein expression levels of iNOS, CD86 and TNF-α
  in the spinal cord of each group was detected by western bloting. (F) The protein
  expression levels of Arginase-1, CD206 and IL-10 in the spinal cord of each group
  were detected by western bloting. Data are shown as means ± SD (n = 6 per group).
