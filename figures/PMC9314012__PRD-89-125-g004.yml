caption: Proposed effects of P gingivalis on hepatic cells. Once the bacteria reache
  the liver, its invasion into hepatocytes is triggered by the P gingivalis induced‐impaired
  function of the lysosome‐autophagosome complex (LC3‐/LAMP2+). P gingivalis outer‐membrane
  vesicles can be released into the cytoplasm and reduce the conversion of phospho‐GSK3
  (inactive form) into GSK3 (active form), subsequently inhibiting the glycogenesis
  mediated by the Insulin/IRS‐1 receptor signaling pathway. In parallel, P gingivalis‐derived
  LPS triggers TLR‐4 signaling cascade that increases transcription of pro‐inflammatory
  genes, such as TNF‐ α and IL‐1β. The released inactive pro‐IL‐1β can be converted
  into active IL‐1β, given that P gingivalis‐derived LPS also up‐regulates the inflammasome
  complex formed by NLRP3 and Caspase‐1. A boost in the concentration of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines in the hepatic milieu removes HSCs from their quiescent state. Further,
  HSCs can also be activated by the release of galectin‐3 (Gal‐3) and TGF‐β1 by hepatocytes
  and Mac2+ Kupffer cells upon LPS exposure. Subsequently, the TGF‐β1/TGFβR2 downstream
  cascade in activated HSCs up‐regulates the transcription of α‐SMA which is responsible
  for HSC differentiation into myofibroblasts. This figure was created using BioRender
