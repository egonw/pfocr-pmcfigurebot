caption: Single-cell analysis of mouse skin before and after injury. (A) T-distributed
  stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plot for all samples with the major cell type
  populations denoted. FBIs, type 1 fibroblasts; FBIIs, type 2 fibroblasts; EBs, epidermal
  and basal cells; IMs, immune cells; VCs, vascular cells; NCs, neural crest derived
  cells; MIs, miscellaneous cells. (B) tSNE map with cells colored by time. (C) The
  expression levels of marker genes among cell types are shown in a violin plot. (D)
  The percentage of each cell type in UW skin and in WO skin at days 4, 8 and 14 (Wo4,
  Wo8, and Wo14). (E,F) Heatmap showing the major incoming or outgoing signals with
  the relative strength of each cell type in UW and WO skin. (G,H) River plot displaying
  the outgoing communication patterns of each cell type as well as the major signaling
  pathways in UW or WO skin. The thickness of the flow indicates the contribution
  of the cell type or signaling pathway to the corresponding pattern.
