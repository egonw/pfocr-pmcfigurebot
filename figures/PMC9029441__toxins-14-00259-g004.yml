caption: Effects of CTN on hepatocyte apoptosis in mice. The protein expression levels
  of Bax, Bcl-2 (A), and cleaved-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-3 (B) in liver tissue were
  detected by Western blot, and analyzed using image-J software. The above data are
  expressed as mean Â± SEM. Compared with the control group, ** p < 0.01.
