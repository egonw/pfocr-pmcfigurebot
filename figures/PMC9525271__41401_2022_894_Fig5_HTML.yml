figure_title: Multi-omics reveals the mechanism by which ADH1C functions as a tumor-suppressor
  in CRC
caption: a There were 183 genes and 1569 proteins which were significantly changed
  in HCT116 cells with overexpressing ADH1C(|log2FC| > 1.5). There are 15 members
  in their intersection and four of them, ADH1C, ASNS, HSPA1A, PSAT1, were proved
  to be associated with overall survival of CRC patients. b Verification of partial
  genes with downregulated expression in the transcriptome results. c The biosynthesis
  of serine and glycine from glucose, PHGDH and PSAT1 in the serine synthesis pathway
  (left); the biosynthesis of asparagine and the role of ASNS. d Metabolomics also
  showed that overexpression of ADH1C significantly reduced intracellular asparagine
  and serine in CRC cells with overexpression of ADH1C. PHGDH phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase;
  PSAT1 phosphoserine aminotransferase; ASNS asparagine synthetase
