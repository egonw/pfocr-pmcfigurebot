caption: 'Effects of RR-AuNPs on mRNA expression in TNF-α/IFN-γ (T + I)-induced HaCaT
  cells. A qRT-PCR assay was conducted to measure the mRNA expression of (A) RENTES,
  (B) TARC, (C) CTACK, (D) IL-6, and (E) IL-8. NC treated with medium alone; T + I,
  inflammation-induced control treated with T + I alone; PC treated with dexamethasone
  followed by T + I stimulation. The crosshatch marks indicate significant differences
  between NC and T + I, and asterisks indicate significant differences between T +
  I and each group. # and *p < 0.05; ## and **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.'
