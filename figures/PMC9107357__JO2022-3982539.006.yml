caption: Correlation of UBE2S with immune and stromal cell infiltration across TCGA
  cancers. Respective scatter plot of UBE2S with immune score (a) and stromal score
  (b) and ESTIMATE Score (c) were adopted to characterize the overall variation tendency
  of immune cells, stromal cells, and tumor purity at the pan-cancer level. Four algorithms
  of EPIC (d), MCPCOUNTER (e), QUANTISEQ (f), and TIMER (g) were applied to evaluated
  specific immune and stromal subsets. The correlation of UBE2S expression with MDSC,
  Th1, and Th2 subsets of CD4+ T cells (h).
