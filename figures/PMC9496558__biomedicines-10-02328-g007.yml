caption: 'BAT gene and functional changes after chronic GC exposure. (a) Ucp1 gene
  expression; (b) UCP1 immunohistochemistry; (c) Ucp1 expression regulators—Adrb3,
  Prdm16, Ppargc1a, and Pparg; (d) brown adipocytes markers—Zic1, Tmem26, Pat2, P2rx5,
  Cidea, and Dio2; (e) citrate synthase maximal activity; oxidation of (f) [1-14C]-palmitic
  acid and (g) D-[U-14C]- glucose; (h) lipolysis pathway genes—Abdh5, G0s2, Fabp4,
  Pnpla2, Lipe, and Mgll; (i) incorporation of D-[U-C14]- glucose into lipids; (j)
  lipogenic pathway genes—Acly, Acaca, Fasn, and Dgat2; (k) Lpl expression; in vivo
  temperature analysis of (l) body and (m) BAT area on days 0 and 28th of control
  (CT), and glucocorticoid-treated (GC) rats. (b) UCP1 staining: 100× magnification.
  Data are mean ± SEM of 8 (CT) and 8 (GC) samples (a,c,d,h,j,k), 8 (CT) and 9 (GC)
  samples (e,f,g,i), and 10 (CT) and 11 (GC) rats (l,m). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001 vs. CT (unpaired Student t-test; Mann–Whitney
  test in (c)-Adrb3 and Ppargc1a).'
