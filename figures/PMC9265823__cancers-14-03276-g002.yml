caption: 'Comparison of immune infiltration between HP+ and HP− GC patients, and WGCNA
  analysis (A) Heatmap demonstrating the difference of immune cells infiltration score
  calculated by ssGSEA and the result of ESTIMATE algorism between HP+ GC patients
  and HP− GC patients. Boxplots illustrating the difference of immune score (B) and
  ESTIMATE score (C) between HP+ GC patients and HP− GC patients. * p < 0.05 (D,E)
  Scale-free fitting indices obtained by soft threshold analysis based on the topological
  network. (F) Clustering dendrogram of immune-related genes (IRGs) (G) Heatmap of
  the correlation between each module with the immune score and ESTIMATE score. (H)
  GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis of IRGs in immune-related modules.
