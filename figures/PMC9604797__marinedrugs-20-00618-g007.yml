caption: Aberrations in the MAPK (RAS-RAF-ERK) signaling pathway leading to chemoresistance.
  BRAFV600E is inhibited by BRAFi, causing inactivation of the MAPK pathway. Amplification
  or alternative splicing of BRAFV600E (BRAFmut) reactivates MAPK pathway in BRAFi-resistant
  tumors. In addition, the MAPK pathway can be reactivated by mutations affecting
  NF1, NRAS or MEK proteins in BRAFi-resistant tumors.
