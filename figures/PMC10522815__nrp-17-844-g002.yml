figure_title: Effects of fucoidan on the migration in A549 lung cancer cells. (A)
  The wound area was imaged by a phase contrast microscope (200 µm scale bar). (B)
  The percentage of wound area (compared with the control) was evaluated using ImageJ
  software. (C) Phalloidin-rhodamine staining for cytoskeleton protrusion was visualized
  by a fluorescence microscopy (20 µm scale bar). All data were expressed as mean
  ± standard error of the mean (n = 5)
caption: '*P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance when compared with
  the untreated control.'
article_title: Antimetastatic effect of fucoidan against non-small cell lung cancer

  pathway.
