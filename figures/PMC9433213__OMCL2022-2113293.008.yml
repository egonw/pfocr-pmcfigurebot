caption: Curcumin protects hyperandrogen-induced apoptosis in ovarian GCs in PCOS
  rats by inhibiting the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway and activating the PI3K/AKT signal. DHT/TM-induced
  GCs were treated with curcumin, 4u8c, LY294002, and 740-YP with or without DHT.
  (a) GCs were incubated with Annexin V-FITC and PI. The cells were imaged for apoptosis
  detection using a FV3000 Olympus microscope. (b, c) Apoptosis protein expression
  of cleaved-caspase-3 was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining (60x) and quantified
  using ImageJ software. (d, e) The expression of casapase-12, caspase-9, and Bax
  was assessed by the western blot assay. Three independent experiments were performed
  with similar results. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. ∗∗p < 0.05.
