caption: Mechanism of study on the intervention effect of Epimedium sagittatum Maxim
  (EPI) on adriamycin nephropathy in rats. EPI can improve podocyte injury, reduce
  inflammatory response, improve oxidative stress injury and inhibit apoptosis in
  rats with adriamycin nephropathy, and its mechanism may be related to PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway, icariin may be the pharmacodynamic substance responsible for this effect.

  by restraining inflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
