caption: Identification of altered signaling pathway in porcine aortic valve interstitial
  cells (pAVICs) exposed to nitric oxide (NO) donor or S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)
  by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). (A) Uniform Manifold Approximation and
  Projection (UMAP) plot of scRNA-seq expression data displays three distinct populations
  of pAVICs cultured in the absence (control; blue) and presence of NO donor (red)
  or GSNO (green) for 5 days. (B) The flow chart represents the filtering criteria
  for the selection of differentially expressed genes. (C) Chord plot illustrates
  overrepresented signaling pathways (at least > 10 genes) and corresponding differentially
  expressed genes identified by PANTHER pathway analysis. The number of genes is mentioned
  in parentheses identified in each pathway.
