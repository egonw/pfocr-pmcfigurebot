caption: 'Inhibition of NPL4 inhibits proliferation and induces ICD in HCC cells.
  (A) Inhibition efficiency of NPL4 in LM3 cells through Western blot analysis. (B)
  The role of NPL4 inhibition in cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. (C) The
  role of NPL4 inhibition in clone-forming capacity of LM3 cells. (D) The role of
  NPL4 inhibition in cell proliferation was detected by Edu assay. Images with magnification
  at 100× are shown here. (E) Apoptosis analysis of LM3 cells after NPL4 inhibition.
  (F) CRT exposure, (G) HMGB1 release, and (H) ATP secretion of LM3 cells after NPL4
  inhibition. (I) Western blot analysis of unfolded protein response and poly-ubiquitylated
  proteins in LM3 cells after NPL4 inhibition. (J) Pathway analysis of LM3 cells after
  NPL4 inhibition. (K) Gene-set enrichment analysis of type Ⅰ interferon response-
  and interferon-gamma response-related genes in LM3 cells after NPL4 inhibition.
  (L) Heatmap of type Ⅰ interferon response-related genes in LM3 cells after NPL4
  inhibition. *: p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. The uncropped blots are shown
