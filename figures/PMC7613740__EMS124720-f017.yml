  restores immunotherapy response
caption: 'a, Quantification of T cell proliferation based on CFSE dilution in DC co-culture
  assays displayed in  (n = 3 tumours per condition). Experiment performed once. P-value:
  ns 0.21, **** 3E-5. b, Scheme illustrating the use of the “thymidinekinase” (HSV-TK)
  suicide gene (activated by ganciclovir [GCV]) to induce apoptosis in the RTT Braf/PtenOVAcancer
  cell line (left) and BLI image and quantification of TGL+ RTT Braf/PtenOVAcancer
  cells at day 0 and 3 post GCV/MEKi administration (n= 5 mice) (right). Experiment
  performed twice; representative example shown. P-value: * 0.0188, * 0.0154. c, CD103+
  DCs (left) and suppressive myeloid cells (right) in RTT Braf/PtenOVA tumours in
  response to GCV or MEKi administration (all groups, n = 5 tumours), assessed by
  flow cytometry. Experiment performed twice; representative example shown. P-value:
  ns 0.3766, * 0.0303, ns; ns 0.9350, **** <E−15. d, Survival curve illustrating treatment
  response in RTT Braf/PtenOVA tumour bearing mice treated with indicated therapies
  (all groups n = 4; except MEKi + ACT, n = 5 mice). Experiment performed twice; representative
  example shown. P-value: ** 0.0029. e, Survival curve and corresponding spider plot
  illustrating treatment response in RTT Braf tumour bearing mice treated with indicated
  therapies (n = 6 mice per group, 2 tumours each). Black arrows indicate immunotherapy
  administration, continuous MEKi was initiated on Day 5. Experiment performed twice;
  representative example shown. P-Value: *** 0.0005. f, Scheme illustrating experiments
  where mice bearing established NTT Braf/PtenOVA tumours were treated with a short
  run-in phase (4 doses) of RAFi or RAFi/MEKi and subsequently switched to ACT. g,
  Tumour infiltration of effector OT-1Luc T cells measured by BLI at 48h post ACT
  in Braf/PtenOVA tumour bearing mice (n = 5 mice per group). Experiment performed
  once with two independent clones. Data represents one representative clone. P-value:
  ns 0.07, 0.071. h, Treatment response of Braf/PtenOVA tumours to ACT (all groups:
  CTRL n = 3 mice, ACT n = 5 mice per group). Data in a -c, g, h displayed as mean
  ± SEM. Data analysis a two-tailed unpaired t-test b, c one-way ANOVA d, e two-sided
  log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001,
  ns = non-significant.'
