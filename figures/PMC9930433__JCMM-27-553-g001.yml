caption: The interaction between JAZF‐1 and PPAR‐γ proteins. (A) The interaction between
  JAZF‐1 and PPAR‐γ proteins tested by western blotting; (B) The relative expression
  of JAZF‐1 protein; (C) The relative expression of PPAR‐γ protein (PPAR‐γ+ JAZF1−,
  and PPAR‐γ− JAZF1− groups were defined as control group, while PPAR‐γ+ JAZF1+ and
  PPAR‐γ− JAZF1+ were defined as intervention group; PPAR‐γ inhibitor was GW9662 and
  PPAR‐γ agonist was rosiglitazone).

  to insulin resistance by regulating JAZF‐1/PPAR‐γ pathway.
