figure_title: Representation of cellular, molecular components and mediators linked
  to inflammation and bone metabolism processes that were evaluated regarding the
  influence of genetic polymorphisms in the development, progression and repair of
  apical periodontitis. Cytokines (IL-1β, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12, -17, TNF-α, INF-γ)
  and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) are intimately related to the macrophage’s
  activity. RANK, RANKL, OPG are main controllers of the bone metabolism process.
  RUNX2, SMAD6 are transcriptional factors of osteoblast activity. BMPs, MMPs, TIMPs
  are proteins secreted into the extracellular media. DEFB1 is a defensine secreted
  by neutrophils. HIF1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of transcription factor HIF-1a,
  which regulates oxygen dependent gene transcription. VDR is recognized as a member
  of the super-family of nuclear receptors that regulate genes expression and has
  a central role in the biology of vitamin D action. WNT, TBX21 and TP63 comprehends
  respectively, signaling pathway, a gene involved in the activity of lymphocytes,
  a gene that encodes a TP63 protein, which controls the cell activity
