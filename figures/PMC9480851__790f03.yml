caption: PBRM1 mediates CDK1 and cyclin B1 repression via the DREAM pathway. (A) Overview
  of p53-dependent regulation of the DREAM pathway. p53 up-regulates p21, which inhibits
  CDK activity, leading to accumulation of the hypophosphorylated forms of p130 and
  p107, which assemble into the repressive DREAM complex, leading to down-regulation
  of target genes with CHR/CDE elements including CDK1 and cyclin B1. (B) Western
  blot analysis of total p130 (p130), phospho-p130 (p-p130), and p21 in untreated
  (UT) or irradiated 1BR3 parental cells and PBRM1 KO cells with or without re-expression
  of PBRM1 (PBRM1 KO5 rescue ± DOX). (C) ChIP-qPCR analysis of p53 binding to the
  p53 response element (RE) of p21 promoter in untreated (UT) or irradiated 1BR3 parental
  cells and PBRM1 KO cells with or without re-expression of PBRM1 (PBRM1 KO5 rescue
  ± DOX), using a nonspecific antibody (negative control) or anti-p53. n = 3; mean
  ± SEM, two-sided paired t-test. (D,E) ChIP-qPCR analysis of p130 binding to the
  CDE/CHR element of the CDK1 (D) or cyclin B1 (E) promoter in untreated (UT) or irradiated
  1BR3 parental cells or PBRM1 KO cells with or without re-expression of PBRM1 (PBRM1
  KO5 rescue ± DOX) using a nonspecific antibody (negative control) or anti-p130.
  n = 3; mean ± SEM, two-sided paired t-test. (F,G) Violin plot and heat map showing
  changes in DREAM target transcript levels from RNA-seq data (F) or DREAM target
  protein levels from mass spectrometry data (G) in 1BR3 parental or PBRM1 KO (KO3
  or KO5) cells between untreated (UT) and 48 h after irradiation. Data are plotted
  as the log2 ratio of values from irradiated versus untreated samples [log2(6Gy 48
  h/UT)]. The red line indicates the median (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test with
  continuity correction).
