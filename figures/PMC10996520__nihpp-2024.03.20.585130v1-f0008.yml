caption: related to . a, Overview of Visium-based spatial transcriptomics on day 21
  mouse SI tissue - (left) H&E staining and (right) spots Leiden-clustered according
  to RNA expression and positioned on the tissue. b, Visium spots colored by imputed
  crypt-villus axis values using continuous label transfer after jointly embedding
  with the mouse Xenium day 30 SI. c, Convolved gene expression of cytokines along
  the imputed crypt-villus axis in the Visium sample. Red labels indicate genes that
  were included in the Xenium gene panel. d, Full version of . Strength of outgoing
  (left), and incoming (right) signals in each signaling pathway across all cell subtypes.
  P14 CD8 T cells are separated into distinct regional types based on IMAP gating.
