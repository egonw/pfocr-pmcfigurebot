figure_title: Role of PRODH in naive pluripotency regulation is not mediated by proline
  metabolism
caption: '(A) Proteomic data of the key kinases associated with proline metabolic
  pathway were compared between Rset naive and primed H9 hESCs. Kinases marked in
  red or green were upregulated or downregulated in the naive state, respectively.
  FC, fold change. (B) The altered protein levels of the key kinases detected in proteomics
  were confirmed in both H1 and H9 hESCs by WB. (C) Comparison of the key metabolites
  in proline metabolic pathway between Rset naive (H9N) and primed (H9P) H9 hESCs.
  Normalized intensity, log10 (scale+1). See also Fig. . (D) Summary of the levels
  of key components in proline metabolic pathway. Kinases and metabolites marked in
  red or green were increased or decreased in the naive state, respectively. (E) Comparison
  of the levels of proline and glutamine between PLKO.1 and shPRODH hESCs in both
  Rset naive and primed H9 cells. In the box plot, horizontal line represents median,
  box ranges represent values between quartiles 1 and 3, and whiskers represent values
  from minimum to maximum. Six biological replicates were analyzed. (F) 8 × 104 of
  Rset and PXGL naive H9 hESCs were seeded in 12-well plates and treated with 2.5 mM
  proline. Cell numbers were counted every 48 h. Cell proliferation curves were shown.
  (G) Rset and PXGL naive H9 hESCs were treated with varying concentrations of proline
  for 6 days and were harvested for WB. The band intensities of SOX2 and NANOG were
  quantitated using ImageJ software and normalized to the values of untreated naive
  cells. Data information: The statistical significance was analyzed using unpaired
  two-tailed Student’s t-test in panels (C, E, F, and G). NS, not significant (P > 0.05).
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. The data shown were all from atleast three
  independent biological replicates. In (F and G), each data point represents an independent
  biological replicate. Data were presented as mean ± SD. .'
