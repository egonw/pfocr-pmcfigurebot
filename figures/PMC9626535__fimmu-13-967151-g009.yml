caption: The effect of the NF-κB signaling pathway on the ferroptosis in GCs. (A,
  B) The ROS level was significantly increased in the si-miR93-5p + BAY group. The
  relative expression of (C) MDA and (D, E) GPX4 among three groups. p < 0.05 (“*”),
  p < 0.001 (“***”), p < 0.0001 (“****”). ns means no statistical difference.
