caption: 'Oxidative stress and its associated metabolisms. Arrow indicates activation;
  T indicates inhibition; T with arrow indicates inhibition leading to activation.
  Abbreviations: PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; FA,
  fatty acid; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation. These effects are summarized in the
  reports mentioned in , , , , , . Different studies reported differential regulations
  to these metabolisms by modulating oxidative stress. Various reports show different
  responses to oxidative stress for the same metabolism.'
