caption: 'Rc activated FXR signaling pathway in LS174 cells: 3D and 2D molecular docking
  conformation of Rc with FXR (A); FXR reporter gene activity assay (B); the cells
  were collected for qPCR analysis, and the relative mRNA levels of FXR (C), BSEP
  (D), and SHP (E) were measured (n = 4). Data are shown as the mean Â± SEM. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs. the DMSO group.'
