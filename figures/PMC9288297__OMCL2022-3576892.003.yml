caption: 'CPB induced mitochondrial dynamics disorder and increased inflammatory factor
  secretion. (a–f) Expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the serum at 0 and 4 hours
  after CPB. Compared to the CPB group, C23 administration decreased the expression
  of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α by 54.0%, 67.5%, and 45.2% at 4 hours, respectively. (g)
  Western blot analysis of renal Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved-caspase-3 expression. (h)
  CPB upregulated the NADPH oxidase via the TLR-4/MyD88 pathway, which promoted the
  expressions of mitochondrial fission-related proteins Fis1 and Drp1 and reduced
  the expression of fusion-related protein Mfn2. ∗P < 0.05 vs. sham; #P < 0.05 vs.
  CPB.'
