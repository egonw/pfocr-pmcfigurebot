caption: 'Inhibition of GSDMD accumulation in endoplasmic reticulum ameliorates acute
  pancreatitis with the down-regulation of TXNIP. (a) The experimental schedule. (b–d)
  The levels of amylase (b), lipase (c) and LDH (d) in serum were detected (n = 3).
  (e) The levels of IL-1β in pancreas tissues were detected (n = 3). (f) The general
  morphology of the pancreas was observed. (gi–giv) Representative H&E images and
  histopathological scores of the pancreas in L-arginine-acute pancreatitis (n = 5).
  Scale bars, 100 μm. (hi,hii) Representative immunofluorescence staining of GSDMD
  (red), CALNEXIN (green) and DAPI (dark blue) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  of pancreas tissues and pearson’s correlation coefficient of GSDMD and CALNEXIN
  (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (ii,iii) Representative immunofluorescence staining
  of GSDMD (red), CALNEXIN (green) and DAPI (dark blue) in isolated primary acinar
  cells from mice and pearson’s correlation coefficient of GSDMD and CALNEXIN (n =
  5). Scale bars, 100 μm. (ji,jii) Representative immunofluorescence staining of TXNIP
  (red) and DAPI (dark blue) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded of pancreas tissues
  (n = 5). Scale bars, 100 μm. All values were shown as the mean ± SEM. #p < 0.05
  compared with control group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with
  mice acute pancreatitis model groups. Unpaired Student’s t-tests were used in (b–e,gii–giv,hii,iii,jii).'
