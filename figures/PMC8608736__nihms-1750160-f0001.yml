figure_title: Study design and molecular profiles in HCM
caption: '(A) Summary of the experimental design workflow. (B) Metabolomic, lipidomic,
  and transcriptomic profiling was performed on left ventricle tissue from HCM patients
  and donor controls. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of all 6,189 metabolite
  features(left), 728 lipids (middle), and 48,167 transcripts (right) clearly separate
  the profiles of HCM from controls. (C) Top metabolic pathways enriched in HCM identified
  by IMPaLA, integrating metabolites, lipids, and transcripts (FDR<0.05). Metabolic
  pathways were categorized as follows: proteins, blue; lipids, orange; carbohydrates,
  black; nucleotides, gray and energy metabolism (purple). (D) Integrated network
  analysis combining all omic datasets using Shiny Genes and Metabolites (GAM) platform.
  Resulting networks were annotated and plotted in Cytoscape. Each node (circle) represents
  a metabolite or lipid and each edge connecting nodes represents an enzyme-encoding
  transcript based on biochemical relationships. The arrowhead determines the principal
  direction of the biochemical reaction. The size of each node and of connecting line
  reflects their p value; the color represents the relative change (blue, decrease;
  red, increase; black, not significant; and gray, not detected). n=6 control and
  n=13 HCM samples for metabolites/lipids; n=7 control and n=13 HCM for transcripts.
  FFA, free fatty acids; M/S-chain, medium/short-chain; L-chain, long chain; AC, acylcarnitine;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
  R5P, ribose 5-phosphate; CER, ceramide; CE, cholesterol ester; PC, phosphatidylcholine;
  PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; and TAG, triacylglycerol.'
