caption: 'Hedgehog signalling regulates antioxidant pathway in osteogenic differentiation
  of TDSCs. (A) qRT–PCR analysis of antioxidant related genes in TDSCs treated with
  25 mM GANT58 under weeklong osteogenic induction. (B) qRT–PCR analysis of antioxidant
  related genes in TDSCs treated with 2 mM SAG under weeklong osteogenic induction.
  (C,E) TDSCs were treated with 25 mM GANT58 under osteogenic induction for 48 h,
  followed by detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by flow cytometry
  (C) and fluorescent microscopy (E). (D,F) TDSCs were treated with 2 mM SAG under
  osteogenic induction for 48 h, followed by detection of ROS levels by flow cytometry
  (D) and fluorescent microscopy (F). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, # no significance.'
