caption: Translocation of selected NSs into the mammalian Golgiâ€”a postulated view.
  (A) GDP-Fuc is transported in more than one route. SLC35C1 transporter carries the
  majority of the GDP-Fuc pool produced from GDP-Man in the de novo biosynthetic pathway
  but does not utilize the pool of the GDP-Fuc formed in the salvage biosynthetic
  pathway. The latter can be translocated by another carrier(s), including a potential
  one with a very low Km able to utilize physiological GDP-Fuc concentrations. (B)
  The identity of the major transporter of UDP-GlcNAc is unclear. The involvement
  of SLC35A3 in the process of transport of UDP-GlcNAc for the formation of antennae
  in complex-type N-glycans cannot be excluded but it seems to be redundant for the
  wild-type glycosylation phenotype. (C) SLC35A1 is a major transporter of CMP-Sia
  but a minor portion of CMP-Sia can translocate to the Golgi in its absence through
  an unknown route. (D) UDP-Gal likely has an alternative transporter to SLC35A2.
  The latter forms a binary complex with SLC35A3 and both can interact with multiple
  other proteins including GlcNAc transferases (Mgats) and other proteins (ATPases
  e.g., ATP2A2 or pH regulators e.g., GPR89B, etc.). In addition, SLC35A2 associates
  with Gal transferases (B4GalTs), B4GalT1 and B4GalT4. (E) SLC35B4 is resident to
  the ER, not to the Golgi. Its correct localization is dependent on the presence
  of the native C-terminal sequence including a conserved dilysine motif. The perturbation
  of this motif including attachment of C-terminal tags results in protein mislocalization.
