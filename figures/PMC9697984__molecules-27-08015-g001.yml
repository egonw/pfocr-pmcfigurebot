caption: Knockdown of the HMGCS2 gene increased cell proliferation and decreased sorafenib
  sensitivity through promoting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt
  signaling pathway in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. (A) Western blot analysis of HMGCS2 knockdown
  in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. (B) shlacZ control and HMGCS2-knockdown Huh7 and HepG2
  cells were treated with 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 μM sorafenib for 48 h, and an MTT
  assay was conducted to detect cell viability. (C) shlacZ control and HMGCS2-knockdown
  cells were treated with sorafenib (0, 4, and 8 μM) for 48 h. phosphorylated (p)-
  and total (t)- MAPK- and AKT-related signaling cascades were evaluated by Western
  blotting. α-Tubulin was used as an internal control. The representative data are
  obtained from three independent experiments. (D) Western blot images from C were
  quantified by using the ImageJ software. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001
  vs. the shlacZ control. Data are shown as the mean ± SD.
