caption: Estrogen reverses the infertility of female mice caused by miR-7a2 deletion.
  (A) The estrus cycle of transplanted model mice was determined by a vaginal smear
  for 18 consecutive days, comprising the diestrus, proestrus, estrus, and metestrus
  stages represented by D, P, E, and M, respectively (n = 4). (B) “WT + KO Ovary”
  mice and “WT + KO Ovary + E2“ mice were separately mated with WT male mice for 3
  weeks, and the litter sizes were recorded (n = 4). (C) Detection of estrogen levels
  in the serum of ovarian transplanted mice (n = 4). Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM. * p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01.
