caption: 'IGF-1 weakens the inhibiting effects of RBG on the malignant characteristics
  of MM cells. RPMI8226 cells were treated with 8 ÂµM RBG and 50 ng/ml IGF-1 (an activator
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway). (A) Cell viability was measured using a Cell
  Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. (C) Cell
  migration was measured using a Transwell assay. (D) Cell invasion was measured using
  a Transwell assay (x400 magnification). **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05,
  ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. RBG. RBG, resibufogenin; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor
