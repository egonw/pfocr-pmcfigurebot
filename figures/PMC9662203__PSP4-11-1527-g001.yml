caption: Project workflow used pathway modeling and electronic health record (EHR)
  analysis to assess drug–drug interactions (DDIs) predicted by network class. (a)
  Starting with drug‐adverse drug reaction (ADR) relationships from drug labels, we
  used protein–protein interaction (PPI) modeling and network classification to predict
  DDIs (workflow demonstrated for ADR‐associated network proteins [ARPs]). We filtered
  predicted DDIs using TWOSIDES for further validation. (b) The starting drug‐ADR
  dataset comprised 1970 drugs associated with 34 different ADRs. For the 970 drugs
  with targets connected to our interactome, we constructed networks and looked for
  downstream associations to ADRs. We used downstream ARPs to define network classes
  and predicted DDIs where non‐ADR drugs targeted downstream proteins. The figure
  depicts a hypothetical “GENE A” class based on the downstream protein, “A.” (c)
  We validated predicted DDIs by measuring hazard ratios between “network” and “non‐network”
  classes with (top row) and without (bottom row) the predicted combination drug and
  took the hazard ratios (HRs) to estimate the DDI effect. Hypothetical example shown
  to depict experimental set‐up.
