caption: 'In vivo model of ubenimex combined with pemetrexed. (a) qRT-PCR detection
  of the SOCS1 expression levels in the tumor tissues of mice under different types
  of treatments. (b) Comparison of tumor volume in each group after tumor xenotransplantation
  in nude mice. (c) The final weight of the tumor in each group. (d) The tumor volume
  of each treatment group compared with no treatment. (e) Immunohistochemistry showing
  Ki67 expression levels in each group of mouse tumors. ∗P < 0.05 for comparison between
  the treatment groups and the sham group; #P < 0.05 for comparison between the 1 mg/ml
  UBE group and the UBE + PEM group.'
