caption: 'Summary of genetic susceptibility of BC and TC. In part 1, PTEN hamartoma
  tumor syndrome (PHTS, comprising Cowden, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba, and Proteus-like
  syndromes) is due to germline mutations of tumor suppressor gene: phosphatase and
  tensin homolog (PTEN). The gene mutation of PTEN upregulates the PI3K-AKT pathway.
  SDHx (the succinate dehydrogenase complex) mutations can dysregulate TP53 by upregulating
  p53 proteasomal. KLLN gene encodes the KLLN protein, which is a transcription factor.
  KLLN mutation influences TP53 dysregulation. In part 2, PARP4 gene encodes poly-ADP-ribose
  polymerases (PARPs) and is an important component of DNA repair. MANCR (mitotically-associated
  long noncoding RNA) is an important regulator of the genomic stability of aggressive
  breast cancer. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was overexpressed in
  TC and BC. In part 3, increased oncogenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) burden
  in co-occurrence of BC and TC.'
