figure_title: HSC inhibited the activation of S100A9/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway
caption: 'a The volcano plot for the MS-identified 441 proteins in colon tissue. Each
  point showed the Log2 (Fold change) in the x axis vs. their corresponding -Log10
  (P-value) in the y axis. A fold change above 1.5, or a fold change below 0.67, was
  considered as differentially expressed, and a P-value of < 0.05 (horizontal dotted
  line) was considered as statistically significant. The black points indicate unaltered
  proteins. The green points and red points indicated the downregulated and upregulated
  proteins, respectively. The red circle represented S100A9. b The biological processes
  of the differentially regulated proteins analyzed by the Metascape database. c Western
  blotting analysis of S100A9 protein level in colon tissues. d Human Caco-2 cells
  were treated with HSC for 1 h, and then treated with recombinant S100A9 protein
  (1 μg/mL) for 2 h. Western blotting analysis of p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38, p-p65 and total
  proteins. e Statistical analysis of p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38, and p-p65 protein level.
  f TNF-α, g IL-6, h IL-1β were measured by ELISA in Caco-2 cells. i Western blotting
  analysis of downstream protein of S100A9, including TLR4, p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38, and
  p-p65 in colon tissues. j Statistical analysis of TLR4, p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38 and
  p-p65 protein level. Data were shown as mean ± SD (n = 3). Each experiment was repeated
  for three times. #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001 vs control group; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 vs S100A9 group or TNBS group.'
