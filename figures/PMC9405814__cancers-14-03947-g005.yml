caption: Following MDM4 inhibition, PC-3 (p53R273H) prostate cancer cell line undergoes
  cellular senescence in vitro, in a process strongly associated with the SKP2/p27
  pathway. Either shMDM4 or shCtrl expression was induced with Doxycycline (Doxy;
  25 ng/mL) in GPF-tagged (GFP+) PC-3 (p53R273H). (a) High-resolution fluorescence
  photos were taken using the Incucyte® system on days 3, 5, and 7 to explore cell
  morphology changes upon MDM4 KD. Images were analysed using the Incucyte® Live-Cell
  Analysis System and the Cell-by-Cell Analysis Software Module. Histograms comparing
  the distribution frequency of the fluorescent area (μm2) of all cells plated at
  a given time point (either day 3, 5 or 7). The software automatically determined
  the histogram bins. Data are shown as a percentage of GFP+ cells. (b) Senescence-associated
  β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining at pH 6 of the PC-3 (p53R273H) cell line on
  day 3, day 5 and day 7 after induction of either shMDM4 or shCtrl expression with
  Doxycycline. SA-β-gal-positive cells stained blue. Scale bars indicate 100 μm. (c)
  Graph shows the percentage of senescent cells relative to the total number of cells
  (per image) on day 7 of three biological replicates. (d) PC-3 (p53R273H) cells were
  collected after 5-day treatment with Doxycycline for RNA and protein analyses, respectively.
  Senescence-related genes CCNA2 (Cyclin A2), CDKN2A (p16), SERPINE1 (PAI-1), CDKN1A
  (p21), CDKN1B (p27), and SKP2 (SKP2) mRNA levels were analysed by RT-qPCR. mRNA
  expression levels were normalised to the housekeeping gene hRLP37a and expressed
  relative to shCtrl. (e) Protein levels of p21, p27 and SKP2 were determined by Western
  blot. Each column corresponds to a biological replicate. The graph shows the Western
  blot densitometric analysis of p21, p27 and SKP2 protein levels normalised to β-actin
  and expressed relative to shCtrl. In all cases, data are shown as mean ± SEM of
  biological replicates (n = 3–6). Statistical significance was calculated using a
  two-tailed Student’s t-test (* p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, **** p ≤ 0.0001). The Raw
  Western blot data is shown in .
