caption: Transcriptome analysis identifies potential pathways in neuroendocrine differentiation
  leading to gastric neuroendocrine hyperplasia and NET development in GFAPΔMen1mice.
  Heat maps of significant DEGs mapped to cell cycle regulation (A) and development
  (B) in GFAPΔMen1 pitNETs compared with WT pituitaries. (C) Validation of select
  DEGs in pitNETs vs WT pituitary by qPCR. N = 4–5 mice per group. WT pituitary group
  represents 4 samples of 3 pooled pituitaries, for a total of 12 tissues in this
  group. ∗P < .05; ∗∗∗P < .001 by 2-way analysis of variance. (D) Cross-validation
  of select pitNET-enriched transcripts in GFAPΔMen1 PNETs and WT pancreas. Data are
  represented as mean ± standard deviatin. (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) Ontology Pathway analysis of wild type pituitary and GFAPΔMen1 pitNETs showing
  the number of genes mapped to enriched pathways and their level of statistical significance.
  (F) KEGG Ontology Pathway analysis of gastric antra from WT and GFAPΔMen1 mice showing
  the number of genes mapped to enriched pathways and their level of statistical significance.
  (G) Heat map showing enrichment of kinesin motor protein transcripts in GFAPΔMen1
  pitNETs. Heat maps depicting downregulation of cytokeratins (H) and immune-related
  transcripts (I) in GFAPΔMen1 antral extracts.
