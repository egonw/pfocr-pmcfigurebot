caption: Crosstalk of cytokines and growth factors could regulate reprogramming in
  WD. (A) Predicted regulation of male-specific processes based on RNA-seq analysis.
  (B) Predicted female-specific regulatory network. Networks represent comprehensive
  synopsis that summarizes the most significant findings in the canonical pathway,
  upstream regulators, and disease and biological function categories of analysis.
  Diagrams were constructed in IPA using Graphical Summary function to visualize related
  biological activities.
