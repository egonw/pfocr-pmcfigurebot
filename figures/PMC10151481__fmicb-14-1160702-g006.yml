caption: Exogenous Alanine reverses the KA resistance of Xoo-RKA.(A) Percentage of
  survival of Z173-RKA in the presence or absence of 40 mmol/L alanine plus 960 μg/mL
  KA. (B) The transcriptional levels of alanine racemase, aminotransferase and PDH
  of Z173-RKA in the presence or absence of 40 mmol/L alanine. (C) The relative pyruvate
  content of Z173-RKA in the presence or absence of 40 mmol/L alanine. (D) Enzymatic
  activity of PDH of Z173-RKA in the presence or absence of 60 mmol/L pyruvate/40
  mmol/L alanine. (E) Percentage of survival of Z173-RKA in the presence or absence
  of 60 mmol/L pyruvate/60 mmol/L/D-alanine plus 960 μg/mL KA. (F) Metabolic pathway
  of alanine into the P cycle. Orange, blue and green shades represent content, enzyme
  activity and gene transcriptional levels, respectively. Results are reported as
  mean ± SD, and p values are identified (*p < 0.05) as determined by the two-tailed
  Student’s t-test. At least three biological repeats were carried out.
