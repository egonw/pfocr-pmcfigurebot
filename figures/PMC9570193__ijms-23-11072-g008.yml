caption: 'Schematic model representation. Reactions and transport processes between
  compartments are symbolized by arrows. Single pathways as defined in biochemical
  textbooks are numbered and highlighted by different coloring: (1) glycogen metabolism,
  (2) fructose metabolism, (3) galactose metabolism, (4) glycolysis, (5) gluconeogenesis,
  (6) oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, (7) non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway,
  (8) fatty acid synthesis, (9) triglyceride synthesis, (10) synthesis and degradation
  of lipid droplets and synthesis of VLDL lipoprotein, (11) cholesterol synthesis,
  (12) tricarbonic acid cycle, (13) respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation,
  (14) β-oxidation of fatty acids, (15) urea cycle, (16) ethanol metabolism, (17)
  ketone body synthesis, (18) glutamine metabolism, (19) serine utilization, and (20)
  alanine utilization. Lipid droplet synthesis and degradation pathways include de
  novo synthesis of lipid droplets, lipid droplet filling, lipid droplet growth and
  fusion as well as lipid droplet degradation in dependence on regulatory surface
  proteins []. Small cylinders and cubes symbolize ion channels and ion transporters.
  Double arrows indicate reversible reactions, which may proceed in both directions
  according to the value of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and cellular concentrations
  of their reactants. Reactions are labeled by the short names of the catalyzing enzyme
  or membrane transporter given in the small boxes attached to the reactions arrow.
  Red boxes indicate enzymes that are regulated by hormone-dependent reversible phosphorylation.
  Metabolites are denoted by their short names. Full names of metabolites and kinetic
  rate laws of reaction rates are outlined in Berndt et al. [] and Wallstab et al.
