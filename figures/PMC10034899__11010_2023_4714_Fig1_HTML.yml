caption: Inflammatory pathway leading to cascade resulting in plaque vulnerability
  and the effect of Sirtuins attenuating pro-inflammatory mediators. Intimal injury
  during vascular intervention or during atherogenesis induce release of DAMPs which
  stimulate inflammatory signaling by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptor
  for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) leading to immune response involving
  increased recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells, secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Altogether, they cause chronic inflammation
  in the plaque and induce vulnerability. Intimal injury also causes disruption of
  vasa-vasorum and leads to hypoxia and oxidative stress which in turn activate sirtuins.
  Increased sirtuins act as oxidative stress scavenger and reduce oxygen radicals
  and decrease oxidative stress which may lead to attenuated plaque vulnerability
