caption: 'Expression of the MAPK signaling pathway protein in knee joint synovial
  tissue of five groups of SD rats detected by western blotting. (a) Western blot.
  (b) p-ERK/ERK. (c) p-P38/P38. (d) p-JNK/JNK. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 10
  for each group). ∗p < 0.05 versus the control group; #p < 0.05 versus the model
  group; &p < 0.05 versus the Rhizoma Drynariae group and the Epimedium group. Three
  independent experiments were performed.'
