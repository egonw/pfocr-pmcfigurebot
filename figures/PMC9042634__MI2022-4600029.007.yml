caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed signaling pathway involved in
  thrombin-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion in HTSMCs. Thrombin-induced
  COX-2 expression associated with PGE2 generation was mediated through PAR1/Gq or
  Gi/o/PKCα/MAPK-dependent NF-κB activation in HTSMCs.
