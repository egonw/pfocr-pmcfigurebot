caption: Model of signaling and gene regulatory mechanisms of TNF-α biosynthesis during
  Orientia tsutsugamushi infection. Orientia tsutsugamushi stimulates receptor(s)
  and activates host MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Signals from NF-κB and ERK
  pathways are required to promote strong transcription. Formation of enhanceosome
  was followed. NF-κB and other transcription factors interact with DNA, co-activators
  such as CBP/p300, and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Transport of TNF-α mRNA
  is facilitated by ERK pathway
article_title: Gene expression and involvement of signaling pathways during host–pathogen
  interplay in Orientia tsutsugamushi infection.
