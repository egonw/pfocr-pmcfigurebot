caption: (a) Representative images of SIRT1, p53, p21 and E2F1 expression in lung
  tissue. Arrows represents target protein expressions for each protein in infiltrated
  cells. Scale bar represents 100 μm. (b) Graphs demonstrate the results of Image
  J analysis for each protein in lung tissues (* p ˂ 0.05). There was no significant
  difference in p53 expression. (c) Representative images of FoxO1, FoxO3a, FoxO4
  and cleaved caspase 3 in lung tissue. Arrows represent target protein expressions
  for each protein in infiltrated cells. Scale bar represents 100 μm. (d) Graphs demonstrate
  the immunohistochemical results of Image J analysis for each FoxO protein in lung
  tissues (* p ˂ 0.05).
