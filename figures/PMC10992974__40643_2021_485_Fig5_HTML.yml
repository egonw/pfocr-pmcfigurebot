caption: Application of the plasmid maintenance system for developing V. natriegens
  to produce 3-HP. The deleted genes are shown with cross marks. A heterologous 3-HP
  synthesis pathway is introduced by overexpressing genes encoding glycerol dehydratase
  (dhaBCE) and its activator (gdrAB) and a NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldH).
  A plasmid stabilization system is developed by deleting the chromosomal glpD gene
  encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and expressing the corresponding gene
  in the expression vector
article_title: Development of a plasmid stabilization system in Vibrio natriegens
  for the high production of 1,3-propanediol and 3-hydroxypropionate.
