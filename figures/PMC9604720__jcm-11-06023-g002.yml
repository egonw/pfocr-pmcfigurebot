caption: 'Mutual interactions between BDNF and serotonin. Antidepressants increase
  the level of serotonin, which accounts for higher 5-HT receptor activity. Activation
  of this receptor increases the cAMP level, which in turn induces the PKA/CREB signaling
  pathway and stimulates BDNF expression. Stress, on the other hand, hinders the production
  of this neurotrophin. 5-HT: serotonin; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  CREB: cAMP response element-binding protein; mRNA: messenger RNA; PKA: protein kinase
  A; TrKb: tropomyosin related kinase.'
