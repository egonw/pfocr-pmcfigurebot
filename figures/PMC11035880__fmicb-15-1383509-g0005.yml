caption: The inhibitory effect of PL on the inflammatory response was mediated through
  the inhibition of the HMGB1/LOX-1 pathway. Pre-treatment with Boxb significantly
  enhanced the mRNA and protein expression levels of HMGB1 (E–G), LOX-1 (H–J), TNF-α
  (A, B), and IL-1β (C, D). Furthermore, treatment with PL effectively attenuated
  the inflammatory amplification induced by Boxb (n = 6/group). All data were displayed
  as mean ± SEM (ns, not significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. N, normal
  peritoneal macrophages; AF, A. fumigatus).
