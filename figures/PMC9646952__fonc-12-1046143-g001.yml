caption: Results of CCK-8 and colony formation assays of PD- and CTX-treated cells.
  (A) The inhibitory effects of PD and/or CTX treatment in HCT116 and LoVo cells were
  examined by CCK-8 assay after treatment for 48 h. (B) The results of CCK-8 assay
  were analyzed with the CalcuSyn software. Combination Index (CI) was calculated
  by the Calcusyn software. CI < 1 was considered synergistic, CI = 1 additive, and
  CI > 1 antagonistic cytotoxicity. (C) The colony-formation assay was performed,
  and the results are displayed as colony numbers. Columns showed mean ± S.D. ‘Control’
  was compared with the other groups, ‘CTX’ was compared with ‘CTX+PD’ using one-way
  ANOVA. *P < 0.05 represents a significant difference.
