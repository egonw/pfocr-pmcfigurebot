caption: (A) Pathway activation strength for pathways related to intracellular kinase
  activity. Pathways were clustered using Ward’s clustering method. (B) Number of
  viable cells transduced with shSCR or shKIT in the presence of ERK1/2 inhibitor
  FR180204 (ERKi), JAK2 inhibitior AG490 (JAKi), or PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (PI3Ki).
  Drugs were added on day 3, then growth medium was changed on day 6, and drugs were
  added in the same concentrations. (C) ERK activity distribution in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS
  cells three days after transduction with shSCR or shKIT vectors. ERK activity was
  determined by calculation of cytoplasm to nuclei (C/N) ration for ERK-KTR reporter.
  Dots represent median C/N ratios for each of six biological repeats. Each repeat
  contains data for 400-700 cells. Violin plots show C/N ratio distribution for all
  analyzed cells. (D) ERK activity distribution for SH-SY5Y cells treated with kinase
  inhibitors for 24 h. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 as determined by Mann–Whitney test.
