caption: 'Schematic representation of the regulatory role of FXR in bile acid homeostasis.
  Top panel: Under physiological conditions, hepatocytes convert cholesterol to bile
  acids following the classic or alternative pathway. Bile acids can bind to and activate
  FXR, which translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of genes
  encoding proteins involved in BA synthesis, transport and degradation, in order
  to maintain sub-toxic BA intracellular levels. Bottom panel: Reduced expression
  and/or function of FXR leads to an increased BA synthesis, and reduced BA efflux
  and degradation. ABCG = ATP-binding cassette subfamily G, BA = Bile acid, BSEP =
  Bile salt export pump, CYP = Cytochrome P450, FXR = Farnesoid X receptor, LRH-1
  = Liver receptor homolog 1, MDR = Multidrug resistance protein, MRP = Multidrug
  resistance associated protein, NTCP = Sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide,
  OATP = Organic anion transporter protein, SHP-1 = Small heterodimer protein-1; Figure
  has been created with BioRender.com.'
