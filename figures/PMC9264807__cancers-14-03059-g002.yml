caption: 'Regulation of SLC7A11 gene expression at multiple levels: Transcription
  levels: KEAP1-NRF2-AP-1/ARE axis, GCN2-eIF-2α-ATF4 axis, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-ETS-1 axis,
  p53, and ATF3. Epigenetic modification levels: BAP1- and PRC1-associated histone
  H2A ubiquitination, USP7- and p53-associated histone H2B ubiquitination, and KDM3B-
  and KDM4A-associated histone methylation. Posttranscriptional levels and translational
  levels: NMD, a series of microRNAs, and IGF-IR-IRS-1. Posttranslational levels:
  Protein degradation: the mTORC1-lysosomal degradation pathway and OTUB1-ubiquitin-proteasomal
  degradation pathway. Protein modification: UFM1-UFMylation. Protein–protein interactions:
  SLC7A11 and CD44, SLC7A11 and BECN1. AARE: amino acid response element; AMPK: adenosine
  5‘-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; AP-1: activator Protein-1; ARE: antioxidant
  response element; ATF3: activating transcription factor 3;ATF4: activating transcription
  factor 4; BAP1: BRCA1-associated protein-1; BECN1: beclin 1; CD44: CD44 molecule;

  control nonderepressible-2; H2A ub: histone H2A ubiquitination; H2B ub: histone
  H2B ubiquitination; H3K9me: methylation of histone H3 Lys 9; IGF-IR: type I insulin-like
  growth factors receptor; IRS-1: insulin receptor substrate; KDM3B: histone H3 lysine
  9 demethylase 3B; KDM4A: histone H3 lysine 9 demethylase 4A;KEAP1: Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein-1; mTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; NMD: nonsense-mediated
  mRNA decay; NRF2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; OTUB1: OTU deubiquitinase,
  ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1; p53: tumour protein p53; PRC1: polycomb repressive
  complex 1; SLC3A2: solute carrier family 3 member 2; SLC7A11: solute carrier family
