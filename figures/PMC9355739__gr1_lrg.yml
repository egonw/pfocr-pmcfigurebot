caption: Viral RNA regulates host miRNA-mRNAs regulatory network. Downregulated miRNAs
  dysregulated hub genes involved in the numeric pathways(A, B), and the upregulated
  miRNAs together with targeting genes involved in cell cycles (C). Gray lines indicate
  the interactive networks of hub genes. Purple hexagons and quadrilaterals represent
  increased expression of genes (A, B) and miRNAs (C), while green colors indicate
  decreased expression of miRNAs and genes after coronaviruses infections. Dysregulated
  genes enriched in multiple pathways (A) by miR-500a-5p/miR-501-5p (red lines) along
  with other miRNAs (blue lines) (B). Purple lines (C) highlight the relationship
  of downregulated genes by miRNAs, and red dash lines indicate some genes clustering
  in the cell cycle pathway. The binding sites are classified into 4 groups (D) based
  on the similarity of nucleotides. Downregulated miRNAs are colored in purple while
  upregulation miRNA are colored in black. The green dots beside miRNAs refer to binding
  sites in the 5′ part of miRNA. The physical locations (E) and the binding sequences
  (F) of specific binding sites were illustrated in the viral RNA genomes. Green dots
  (E) represent miR-501-5p, while red dots represent miR-500a-5p. The bases (F) completely
  pare at positions 2–7 from the 5′ part of miR-501-5p, implying miR-501-5p obtains
  the most strongly sponging ability. “2019-nCoV 13,696–13,718” indicates 2019-nCoV
  RNA sequence at the position ranging from 13,696 to 13,718. Evidence of the interaction
  between 2019-nCoV and miR-501-5p and miR-500a-5p was seen in Figure G (G). The relative
  luciferase levels were estimated as the ratio between each value versus the basic
  vector. Reduced firefly luciferase expression indicates miRNAs bind to the cloned
  2019-nCoV sequence. miR-500a-5p and miR-501-5p were able to reduce the firefly luciferase
  when cotransfected with 2019-nCoV wide-type (WT) sequence. Wild-type and mutated
  (Mut) Cov-2019 sequences in miRNAs binding sites were respectively coexpressed with
  mimic-miRNAs (miR-500a-5p and miR-501-5p) and mimic-miR-control (NC). The experiments
  were repeated double times. Schematic model illustrating coronaviruses regulated
  gene expressions via sponging host's miR-501-5p and miR-500a-5p (H). RCS, reverse
  complement sequence.
