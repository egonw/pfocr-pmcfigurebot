caption: Caspase-8K14R represses cell growth in vivo. (A, B) Nude mice were injected
  with the SPCA1 cell line overexpressing the rs3769823[A] or rs3769823[G] allele.
  Images and growth curves of xenograft tumors are shown. (C, D) Tumor volumes and
  weights were calculated. (E) Tumor sections with H&E staining and IHC staining with
  antibodies against Ki-67 are shown (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
article_title: A causal variant rs3769823 in 2q33.1 involved in apoptosis pathway
  leading to a decreased risk of non-small cell lung cancer.
