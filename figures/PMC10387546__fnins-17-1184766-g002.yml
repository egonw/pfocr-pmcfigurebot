caption: In the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-mediated anti-inflammatory
  process, ischemia–reperfusion leads to the expression and activation of CGRP and
  then inhibits the p38 signaling pathway, resulting in the decline of interleukin-1,
  tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, which further reduces neuronal death.
