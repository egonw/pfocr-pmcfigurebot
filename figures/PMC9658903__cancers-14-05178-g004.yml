caption: Injecting intratumourally with P. acnes from EOC can promote tumour growth
  and reduce tumour model survival as well as mixed bacteria from EOC. (A) Scheme
  of the animal experiment. (B) Changes in tumour volume over time in different treatment
  groups. (C) Final tumour weights in different treatment groups. (D) Kaplan–Meier
  survival curves of mouse EOC models in different treatment groups. Data are presented
  as means ± SD. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, both with Tukey’s test for multiple
  comparisons, (B) and (C), respectively, and log-rank test were performed for survival
  data (D); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
