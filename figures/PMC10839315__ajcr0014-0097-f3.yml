caption: CTSC overexpression enhanced EMT through the YAP signaling pathway. A. CTSC-overexpressing
  cells are transfected with siRNA for YAP. Knockdown of YAP significantly changes
  the expression of EMT markers and MMPs. B, C. Transwell migration and invasion assay
  showing that YAP knockdown inhibits CTSC-induced cell migration and invasion. The
  number of cells in five randomly chosen fields is counted. Data are presented as
  the means ± standard deviation and are evaluated using Student’s t-test (n = 3).
  Scale bar, 200 μm. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
