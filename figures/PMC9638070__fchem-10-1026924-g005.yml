caption: The MnPB NPs promote ferroptosis in PANC-1 cells through the MAPK signal
  pathway. (A) The expression level of GPX4 in different treatments. (B) Cell viability
  was analyzed by CCK-8 assay at the indicated time in PANC-1 cells with DMSO or Ferrostain-1.
  (C) The colony formation assay of PANC-1 cells with DMSO or Ferrostain-1. (D) The
  statistical analysis of colony formation assay of PANC-1 cells with DMSO or Ferrostain-1.
  (E) Western blotting showed the effects of different treatments on the MAPK pathway
  in PANC-1 cells. (F) Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay at the indicated
  time in PANC-1 cells with DMSO or C16-PAF. (G) The colony formation assay of PANC-1
  cells with DMSO or C16-PAF. (H) The statistical analysis of colony formation assay
  of PANC-1 cells with DMSO or C16-PAF. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p
  < 0.0001.
