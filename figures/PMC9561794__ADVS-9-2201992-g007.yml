caption: Functional enrichment and cluster analysis of differentially expressed proteins
  (DEPs) between the KD and SD groups. A) Principal coordinates analysis (PCA) of
  tumor tissues collected from the KD (left) and SD (right) groups treated for 16
  d in PDX1 (n = 3 samples/arm). B) Comparison of protein expression in the KD versus
  SD group (n = 3 samples/arm). Differentially expressed proteins are highlighted
  with red (fold change > 1.5) or blue (fold change < 1/1.5). C) KEGG pathway enrichment
  of upregulated proteins. D–F) Functional enrichment of upregulated proteins according
  to GO “biological process,” “molecular function,” and “cellular component” between
  the KD and SD groups (KD/SD). G) Functional enrichment of downregulated proteins
  according to GO “molecular function” between the KD and SD groups (KD/SD). H) Protein‒protein
  interaction (PPI) network of differentially expressed molecules. Red indicates upregulated
  molecules, and green indicates downregulated molecules. I) Relative protein expression
  of metabolic molecules associated with ketolytic, OXPHOS, and glycolytic pathways
  (Rel. expression, the ratio between KD and SD groups, KD/SD).
