figure_title: RHBDL2 is upregulated in PC and positively related to worse prognosis
  of PC patients
caption: 'A, B Expression of RHBDL2 in the HPDE cells and six PC cell lines (CFPAC-1,
  MIA PaCa-2, SW1990, AsPC-1, PANC-1, and BxPC-3) was determined by qRT-PCR and Western
  blot assays, respectively. C, D qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis of RHBDL2 expression
  in PC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues. IHC assay confirmed the levels of
  RHBDL2 expression in the PC tissues compared with that in the adjacent non-tumor
  tissues (E), and in metastatic PC tissues compared with that in non-metastatic PC
  tissues (F), respectively (n = 95). Scale bar: 100 μm. G Kaplan-Meier analysis of
  PC patients with high/low RHBDL2 expression. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
article_title: RHBDL2 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by stabilizing the N1ICD via the OTUD7B and activating the Notch signaling
  pathway.
