caption: 'PG inhibited GBM cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest (a) PG
  inhibited the viability of GBM cells in a dose-dependent manner: cell viability
  was detected by the CCK8 assay at a specific time points after treatment with different
  doses of prodigiosin. (b) EdU immunofluorescence staining of LN229, U251 and A172
  cells treated with or without PG 48 h. Cells were stained with Apollo 567 (red).
  Hoeschst (blue) was used to stain nuclei. (c) Quantification of EdU + cells (EdU
  positive/Hoechst positive × 100%) in all three GBM cell lines (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
  (d) Images of colony formation assays for LN229, U251 and A172 cells after treating
  with PG (200 nM) for 2 weeks.'
