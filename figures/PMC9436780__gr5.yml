caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differential gene expression profilesFold change
  values of genes in experimental groups compared to no-challenge were inputted to
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software and sorted into canonical pathways. The highest
  and lowest 20 canonical pathways by Z score in the female DIO challenge group are
  shown.
