figure_title: Pronounced extrafollicular B cell activation in people living with HIV
  (PLWH)
caption: (A) Naïve (CD27- IgD+) and double negative (DN; CD27- IgD-) B cell activation
  was measured as a CD21- CD95+ phenotype. The respective activated populations are
  thus DN2 and activated naïve. (B) Prevalence of the DN2 and activated naïve phenotypes
  with respect to HIV status. (C) The DN2 frequencies were tracked longitudinally
  and with respect to disease severity (ordinal scale 1–3) and neutrophil-lymphocyte
  ratio (NLR), respectively. Error bars indicate standard deviation (HIV- n = 37;
  HIV+ n = 33). (D) Spearman non-parametric correlation of the DN2 B cell response
  relative to the anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titre. Statistical analyses
  were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test for multiple comparisons and Mann-Whitney
  for disease severity or NLR comparisons within groups. p Values are denoted by *≤0.05;
  **<0.01; ***<0.001, and ****<0.0001.
