caption: 'Transcriptomic profile demonstrates downregulation of TGFβ signaling components
  in mSSCs isolated from injured TBI. (A) Principal component analysis plot shows
  clustering of mSSCs FACs sorted specimens from injured and control tissues (n =
  5 pooled, with 3 replicates) at post-injury day 7. (B) Heatmap of bulk RNA-seq data
  showing differential peaks (log2(normalized reads in peaks)) of injured mSSCs and
  control mSSC cohorts gene expression from post-injury day 7. Gene enrichment is
  noted in color key and histogram at the upper left. (C) Heatmap of selected genes
  of interest from overall heatmap differential peaks with significant upregulation
  of the Indian hedgehog pathway and downregulation of the TGFβ pathway. (D) GO terms
  enriched for genes upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) in injured versus
  control mSSCs at post-injury day 7, identified by bulk RNA-seq. Select GO terms
  with significant P-values (Fischer exact test) are shown. (E) Injured mSSCs showed
  decreased image intensity of the nuclear localization of pSMAD2 (green) compared
  to control mSSCs (P < .001). Immunofluorescence of pSMAD2 (top column), DAPI staining
  (middle column), and merged images are shown. Original magnification: 20×. The image
  is representative of 3 experiments. (F) Significant decrease in quantified mSSC
  pSMAD2 immunofluorescence image intensity after injury which was performed with
  ImageJ and photoshop software. G, RT-PCR assay confirmed Col1a and Pal1 were downregulated
  in injured mSSCs compared to sham control (n = 15 pooled mice).'
