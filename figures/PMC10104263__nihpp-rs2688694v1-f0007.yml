caption: Inhibition of D-NHEJ pathway reversed PARPi resistance in BRCA1-mutated ZNF251
  KD cellsBlockade of D-NHEJ pathway reversed PARPi resistance of ZNF251KD in vitro
  and in vivo. A. Wildtype (WT) and ZNF251KD MDA-MB-436 cells were treated with olaparib
  and DNA-PKcs inhibitor PIK-75 (8 nM). B. Wildtype (WT) and ZNF251KD MDA-MB-436 cells
  were treated with olaparib and DNA-PKcs inhibitor nedisertib (8 μM). C. Wildtype
  (WT) and ZNF251KD MDA-MB-436 cells were treated with olaparib and DNA-PKcs inhibitor
  AZD-7648 (4 μM). D. Schematic description of our in vivo experimental design. E,
  F. The effect of olaparib and olaparib+PIK-75 on the growth of ZNF251 wildtype and
  ZNF251KD MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells xenografts in NSG mice was tested. Results
  represent mean tumor volume and weight ± SDs.
