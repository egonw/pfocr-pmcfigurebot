caption: Cytokine signaling pathways related to pathogenesis of COVID- 19. The binding
  of ligands to receptors causes auto- and trans-phosphorylation of JAK proteins,
  which causes STATs to be phosphorylated and dimerized, followed by their translocation
  to the nucleus, and exert their effect by binding to related DNA sequences and affect
  the expression of genes responsive to inflammatory cytokines ().]. IL-6 can involve
  in the CRS by activating JAK/STAT-3 pathway. Furthermore, IL-1, IL-18, and TNF-Î±
  can bind to specific receptors and cause more nuclear NF-B translocation and phosphorylation
  of p38 MAPK, leading to an increased expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (). (created with biorender.com).
