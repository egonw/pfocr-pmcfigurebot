caption: Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis plots comparing
  ad-sEV microRNA from patients with AD and non-AD controls. (A). The heatmap of the
  differentially expressed microRNAs identified in the ad-sEVs isolated from the CSF
  demonstrates almost complete separation of patients with AD (gray) and controls
  (black) along the y-axis on the left of the heatmap. The clustering of the differentially
  expressed miRNAs can be found along the top of this heatmap. The color bar represents
  the standardized expression of each microRNA to a mean of 0. Upregulated microRNAs
  have positive values and are displayed in red. Downregulated microRNAs have negative
  values and are displayed in blue. (B). The PCA plot from the CSF demonstrates that
  subjects cluster according to their disease state (AD vs. control). Each dot represents
  the overall microRNA expression of a single subject. Black represents control subjects,
  and gray represents subjects with AD. (C). The heatmap of the differentially expressed
  microRNAs identified in the ad-sEVs isolated from the serum demonstrates almost
  complete separation of patients with AD (gray) and controls (black) along the y-axis
  on the left of this heatmap. The clustering of the differentially expressed miRNAs
  can be found along the top of the heatmap. (D). The PCA plot from the serum demonstrates
  that subjects cluster together according to their disease state.
