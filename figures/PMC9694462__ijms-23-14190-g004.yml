caption: '5D3PC enhances the expression of TYR and TRP-1 in the skin of C57BL/6 mice.
  (A) and (B) Effect of 5D3PC on expression and content of melanogenic protein in
  C57BL/6 mouse skin. Immunohistochemical staining of TYR and TRP-1 in the skin of
  mice. showed positive staining for TYR and TRP-1. (×200, n = 10). (C) Depict quantitative
  data of positive cells. (D) C57BL/6 mouse skin-TYR levels were analyzed using a
  TYR assay ELISA kit. (E) Effects of 5D3PC on content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in
  serum of mice (n = 10). C57BL/6 mouse serum-MDA levels were analyzed using an MDA
  assay ELISA kit. All results are expressed as mean ± SD; statistical analysis was
  performed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. ##p
  < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 compare with control group. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared
  with Model group.'
