figure_title: Hypothetical model for rhythmic release of keratinocyte EVs
caption: The core clock transcription/translation pathway regulates rhythmic expression
  of TIMP3, an enzyme required for synthesis of the disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM17
  or TACE. TACE mediates extracellular cleavage of membrane-bound TNF to release the
  free growth factor. TNF can act in either an autocrine or paracrine fashion to regulate
  rhythmic release of EVs. Created in BioRender.
