caption: 'Analysis of RECK gene expression by semiquantitative end-point RT-PCR after
  miR-21 silencing. Total RNA and cDNA synthesis were obtained from 1 × 105 CaSki
  and SiHa cells per well in a six-well plate containing DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2
  after 48 h transfection with pSIMIR21-5P plasmid. Panel (A): Analysis of RECK gene
  expression by semiquantitative end-point RT-PCR in CaSki cells that were not transfected
  (NT, lane 1) or transfected with increased concentration of pSilencer1.0-U6 empty
  vector plasmid (lanes 2 to 4) or with increased concentration of pSIMIR21-5P plasmid
  (lanes 5 to 7). PCR amplification products were separated by electrophoresis in
  1% agarose gel. The DNA 100 bp ladder was used as molecular weight. Panel (B): Analysis
  of RECK gene expression by semiquantitative end-point RT-PCR in SiHa cells in similar
  transfection conditions. The graphical representations correspond to PCR product
  bands, which were digitalized and analyzed by densitometer using the ImageJ program,
  and data were analyzed by mRNA RECK/mRNA GADPH ratio in relative expression units.
  The values were normalized with the NT cells (NT) and are presented as mean ± SD.
  p values < 0.05 are indicated with an asterisk.'
