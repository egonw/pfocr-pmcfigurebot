caption: Histological observation of M. mercenaria gills exposed to different durations
  of hypo-salinity stress. (A) S30; (B) S10_1d; (C) S10_5d. Intracellular and extracellular
  vacuoles are marked by red arrows. (For interpretation of the references to colour
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

  to hypo-salinity stress and osmoregulatory role of cAMP-PKA pathway in Mercenaria
  mercenaria.
