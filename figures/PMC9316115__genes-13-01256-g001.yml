caption: 'Anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Enzyme names are indicated in boxes. Enzyme
  names are as follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; STS, stilbene synthese; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI,
  chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase;
  ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; UFGT, UDP glucose: flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  AOMT, anthocyanin O-methyltransferases; AT, anthocyanin 3-O-glucucoside-6″-O-acyltransferase;
  GST, glutathione S-transferase; MATE, multidrug and toxic extrusion, ABC transporters,
  transporters of the ATP binding cassette protein family. In parallel to the biosynthesis
  pathway, important anthocyanin intermediates are shown in blue boxes: delphidin,
  delphinidin-glc, petunidin-glc, and malvidin-glc correspond to tri-hydroxylated
  molecules whose synthesis involves F3′5′H and F3H. Cyanidin, cyanidin-glcm and peonidin-glc
  correspond to dihydroxylated molecules whose synthesis depends on F3′H and F3H.'
