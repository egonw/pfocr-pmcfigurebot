caption: 'Detection of TUNEL apoptosis in renal tissue and observation of mitochondrial
  morphology by transmission electron microscopy. (A) TUNEL apoptosis detection, as
  shown by red light (400×). (B) Area occupied by TUNEL-positive cells in renal tissue,
  as determined by image analysis. (C) Changes in mitochondrial structure in renal
  tissue in each group observed by transmission electron microscopy (RTEC magnification
  5000×; podocyte magnification 6000×). C: Control group; H: Hypoxia injury group;
  P: PPARγ agonist group.'
