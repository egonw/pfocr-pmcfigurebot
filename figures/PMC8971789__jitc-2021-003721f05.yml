caption: Ad-mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene (MAVS) infection elicits a significant
  induction of type I interferon (IFN) pathways and proinflammatory cytokines in vitro.
  (A–D) Ad-MAVS infection upregulates the expression of MAVS and the downstream type
  I IFN pathway genes via quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) (A) in CT26.CL25 (A) and MC38
  cells (C) in vitro (n=3). The release of IFNβ was confirmed with ELISA (n=5) (B)
  and (D). (E–H) Ad-MAVS infection upregulates the expression of MAVS and the downstream
  type I IFN pathway genes via QRT-PCR in mouse melanoma B16-F10 cells (E) and breast
  cancer 4T1 cells (G) (n=3). The release of IFNβ was confirmed with ELISA (n=5) (F)
  and (H). (I–L) Ad-MAVS infection upregulates the expression of MAVS and the downstream
  type I IFN pathway genes via QRT-PCR in multiple patient-derived xenografts colorectal
  cancer cells in vitro, including CRC167(I), and CRC57(K) (n=3). The release of IFNβ
  was confirmed with ELISA (J) and (L). N=6–10, bars indicate SD, and ** represents
  p<0.01.
