caption: 'Effects of RRM2 on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) WB and (B) semi-quantification
  of WB revealed the protein expression levels of β-catenin in MEFs cultured with
  osteogenic inducing medium from day 0 to 21. (C) WB and (D and E) semi-quantification
  of WB revealed the protein expression levels of β-catenin and the ratio of p-GSK-3β
  to GSK-3β in MEFs after infection by AdRRM2. (F-H) WB and semi-quantification of
  WB indicated the protein expression levels of β-catenin and the ratio of p-GSK-3β
  to GSK-3β in MEFs after RRM2 was knocked down using siRRM2. (I and J) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR analysis revealed the expression levels of the downstream related target genes
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (β-catenin, Axin2, TCF7L2, LEF1, c-MYC and
  Cyclin D1) in MEFs following infection by AdRRM2 or siRRM2. ##P<0.01 vs. Day 0 group.
  *P<0.05; **P<0.01. RRM2, ribonucleotide reductase M2; WB, western blotting; MEFs,
  mouse embryo fibroblasts; p-, phosphorylated; AdRRM2, RRM2-overexpressing recombinant
  adenovirus; siRRM2, small interfering RNA-RRM2; TCF7L2, transcription factor 7 like
  2; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1.'
