figure_title: Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway
caption: Binding of Wnt ligands to cognate receptors Frizzled and Lrp5/6 leads to
  the formation of a multiprotein complex known as the signalosome. The signalosome
  recruits Dvl, Axin, Gsk3, and casein kinases to the plasma membrane, leading to
  the dissociation of the cytosolic destruction complex. In turn, this promotes β-catenin
  stabilization, which translocates into the nucleus. Here, together with TCF/LEF
  transcription factors, β-catenin induces Wnt target gene activation. Axin2, Rnf43
  and Znrf3 are both target genes and inhibitors of the Wnt pathway, thus forming
  a negative feedback loop.
