caption: The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ISC regulation. A ligand
  for the canonical Wnt/β-catenin attaches to Frizzled receptors then assembles a
  complex on the surface of the cell together with LRP5/6. The binding of R-spondin
  to LGR5/6 inhibits the frizzled receptor's activity by ubiquitinating ZNRF3 and
  RNF43. When the Wnt receptor complex is activated, GSK-3β is dissociated from APC/Axin/GSK-3β.
  Dvl is activated by sequential phosphorylation, polymerization and polyubiquitination
  in response to PAR-1 and is inhibited by CYLD and NaKed. Stable β-catenin enters
  the nucleus through Rac1, contacts LEF/TCF, displaces co-repressors, then recruits
  co-activators in Wnt target genes. On the other hand, TGF-β/BMP regulates NLK into
  the nucleus through TAK1 to inhibit β-catenin expression. Without Wnt signaling,
  β-catenin acts as a transduction co-regulatory molecule and an intercellular adhesion
  junction protein, which is phosphorylated by CK1α and the APC/Axin/GSK-3β complex,
  resulting in ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome via the β-TrCP/Skp
  pathway. In addition, β-catenin works in concert with several different transcription
  factors to control specific targets.
