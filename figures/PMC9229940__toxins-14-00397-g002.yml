caption: Toxicity pathway and tumor-promotion activity of phytoplankton toxins. Phytoplankton
  toxins such as nodularin and okadaic acid (OA) bind the protein phosphatase (PP),
  which triggers the inactivation of PP, further leading to tumor formation. OA causes
  lipid peroxidation, and ROS generation has also been examined in the context of
  the JNK pathway, which causes mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to excessive ROS
  production and tumor formation. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide, lyngbyatoxin-A, aplysiatoxin,
  and azaspiracid can cause tumor formation by triggering the production of tumor
  necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and inducing early response genes.
