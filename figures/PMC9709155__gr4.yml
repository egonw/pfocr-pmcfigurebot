caption: VDAC-1-dependent mitochondrial H2O2 release increases the cytoplasmic oxidation
  state. A) N2 and isp-1;ctb-1 animals expressing Grx1-roGFP2. Data shown is the ratio
  between oxidized versus reduced roGFP2 and normalized on N2 L4. n = 25 animals per
  condition. ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. B) Quantification
  of KLF-1 nuclear localization in N2 and isp-1;ctb-1 worms upon vdac-1 RNAi. n = 30
  animals per condition. ****p < 0.0001, Chi-square test. C) isp-1;ctb-1 lifespan
  on vdac-1 RNAi. n = 200 worms per condition. D) Quantification of immunoblot of
  whole worm lysate of L4 N2 and isp-1;ctb-1 animals expressing pvha-6::tomm20::roGFP2-Orp1.
  Anti-GFP and anti-HSP-1 (loading control) antibodies were used. Shown is the ratio
  between oxidized versus reduced roGFP2 corrected for HSP-1 and data are normalized
  on N2 EV. n = 3 per condition. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. E) Schematic pathway demonstrating our findings.
