caption: The expression of circ_000166 decreased in the kidney of DN mice. (a) Detect
  the expression level of circ_000166 in the kidney tissue of each group of mice by
  qRT-PCR. Compare (b) the blood glucose level, (c) weight, (d) kidney-to-body weight
  ratio, and (e) urine protein levels of mice between the two groups. All values are
  expressed as mean ± standard. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
