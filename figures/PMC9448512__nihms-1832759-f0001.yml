figure_title: Canonical and non-canonical AhR signaling pathways
caption: Upon binding to an agonist, such as kynurenine (KYN), AhR leaves its chaperone
  complex and translocates to the nucleus. In the canonical pathway, AhR interacts
  with ARNT and binds the xenobiotic response element (XRE) nucleotide sequence to
  drive the expression of target genes including CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. The non-canonical
  pathway, in contrast, involves the interaction of AhR and KLF6 binding to a non-consensus
  XRE (NC-XRE) nucleotide sequence to drive expression of target genes including PAI-1
  and p21cip1. Figure created with BioRender.com.
