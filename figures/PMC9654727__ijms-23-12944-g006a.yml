caption: 'Myoblast differentiation and myotube formation in the C2C12 cell line with
  different treatments with PI3k/Akt inhibitor (LY294002) and mTOR inhibitor (Rapamycin).
  (A) Immunofluorescent staining of myotubes of VIB, Mg and combined treatment groups
  appeared morphologically distinct from the Con group. (B) Myotube diameters, myotube
  nuclei numbers of VIB, Mg and Mg + VIB groups showed a significant difference compared
  with the Con group. (C,D) Inhibitor groups showed significant smaller myotube diameters
  and myotube nuclei numbers. Scale Bar: 50 μm. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  and **** p < 0.0001, n = 10–15.'
