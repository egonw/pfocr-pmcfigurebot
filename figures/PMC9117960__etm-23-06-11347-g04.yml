caption: 'Simvastatin inhibited the EMT of SRA01/04 cells induced by HG by suppressing
  RhoA/ROCK signaling transduction. Protein levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin
  and α-SMA were detected by western blot analysis after the treatment of HG, 10 nM
  simvastatin and the activator of RhoA/ROCK pathway U46619. Data are expressed as
  mean ± SD. ***P<0.001 vs. Control. ###P<0.001 vs. HG. ΔΔΔP<0.001 vs. HG + Sim (10
  nM). HG, high glucose; Sim, simvastatin; SD, standard deviation.'
article_title: Simvastatin alleviates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and oxidative
  stress of high glucose-induced lens epithelial cells in vitro by inhibiting RhoA/ROCK
  signaling.
