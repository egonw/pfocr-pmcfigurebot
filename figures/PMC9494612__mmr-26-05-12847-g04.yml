caption: 'Effects of M1 macrophages on the anti-apoptotic ability of liver cancer
  cells via activating the NF-κB pathway. (A and B) Flow cytometry was used to measure
  apoptosis of (A) HepG2 and (B) SNU-182 cells in RM or CM after treatment with or
  without ADM. (C and D) X-ray induced-apoptosis of (C) HepG2 and (D) SNU-182 cells
  in RM or CM. ###P<0.001 vs. RM + Control group; ***P<0.001 vs. RM+X-ray group; &&P<0.01,
  &&&P<0.001 vs. CM+X-ray or CM+ADM group. RM, regular medium; CM, conditioned medium;
  PI, propidium iodide; ADM, Adriamycin.'
