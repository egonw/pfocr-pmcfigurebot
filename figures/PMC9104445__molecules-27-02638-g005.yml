caption: 'Effect of piperine pretreatment on pro-NGF, NGF, MMP7, and MMP9 protein
  levels in the hippocampus of KA-treated rats. The upper panels show representative
  Western blots. The lower panel is the relative density bar graph. Quantification
  of each protein was normalized to β-actin. Data are presented as the means ± S.E.M.
  (n = 5). # p < 0.001 versus the KA group; *** p < 0.001 versus the control group
  (ANOVA/Scheffé).'
