figure_title: Effects of CA on mitochondrial function and morphology of H2O2-treated
  murine LMSCs
caption: '(A) The MMP levels of cells; #P < 0.01 versus CTRL group. Data were obtained
  from three independent experiments; **P < 0.01 versus H2O2 group; &P < 0.05 versus
  NAC group; @P > 0.05 versus 50 µM CA group. (B) Cellular ATP production of each
  group. Data were obtained from three independent experiments; #P < 0.01 versus CTRL
  group; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus H2O2 group; @P > 0.05 versus NAC group. (C)
  The mitochondria were observed by transmission electron microscopy (magnification:
  14,000×).'
