caption: PDAI4 via JNK/c‐Jun signaling to enhance tumorigenesis and RT resistance.
  A Western blot analysis of JNK/c‐Jun signaling pathway‐related proteins, the results
  revealed that JNK, c‐Jun, p‐JNK, p‐c‐Jun expression levels in TNBC cells with PDIA4
  knockdown or overexpression with/without IR. B, C and D The target cells were transfected
  with shRNA3 or shNC with/without IR, then cultured with SP600125, cell proliferation
  was tested using the CCK‐8 assay, apoptosis was detected by FACS assay, and the
  protein was analyzed by western blot. E Western blot analysis of TAX1BP1 expression
  after transfection. F, G and H The target cells with or without TAX1BP1 overexpression
  following treatment with IR, cell proliferation was tested using the CCK‐8 assay,
  apoptosis was detected by FACS assay, and the protein was analyzed by western blot
