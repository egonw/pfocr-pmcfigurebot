caption: DEG enrichment by gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways. Based on GO
  analysis, treatment with trichodermin at 100 μg/mL resulted in enrichment in GO
  terms such as carbohydrate metabolic process, integral component of membrane, intrinsic
  component of membrane, and carbohydrate binding and transporter activity. The most
  enriched GO terms after treatment with trichodermin at 10 μg/mL were carbohydrate
  metabolic process, integral component of membrane, intrinsic component of membrane,
  and carbohydrate binding. The most enriched KEGG pathways in the 100 μg/mL and 10
  μg/mL trichodermin treatment groups were biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
  glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, carbon metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, and fatty
  acid metabolism.
