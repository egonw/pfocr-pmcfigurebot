caption: 'TH ameliorates myocardial infarction and relieves myocardial pathological
  damage. Therapeutic hypothermia reduces infarct size, lowers serum markers of MI
  and preserves the myocardium. (A) Representative TTC staining in all groups at the
  end of reperfusion. (B) Myocardial infarct area % of the area at risk in all groups.
  (C–E). CK‐MB, LDH and cTnI levels in all groups. (F) Representative haematoxylin
  and eosin (HE) staining of heart sections from all groups. *p < 0.05 versus control
  group; #p < 0.05 versus I/R group; Δp < 0.05 versus 34H+DMSO group. &p < 0.05 versus
  34H+3‐TYP group.'
article_title: Therapeutic hypothermia alleviates myocardial ischaemia–reperfusion
  injury by inhibiting inflammation and fibrosis via the mediation of the SIRT3/NLRP3
  signalling pathway.
