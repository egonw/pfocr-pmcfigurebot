figure_title: Two distinct profiles of Wnt-βcatenin activated tumours are identified
  based on immune features
caption: (A) Heatmap representation of the main immune features of the distinct profiles.
  (B) Volcano plot showing the differentially expressed genes between inflamed and
  non-inflamed profiles. (C, D) Barplot representation of (C) the richness of the
  immune infiltrate and (D) TLS density as assessed by H&E examination. (E) Boxplot
  comparing the expression of cytokines and ligands repressed by Wnt-βcatenin pathway.
  (F) Heatmap comparing the methylation of genes involved in antigen type I presentation
  in the TCGA cohort. P values are calculated by (A, F) Student’s t-test, (C, D) Fisher’s
  exact test and (E) Wilcoxon rank-sum test. *P < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001. ns, not significant. TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular
  Carcinoma; TLS, tertiary lymphoid structures.
