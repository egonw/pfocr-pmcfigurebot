caption: Effect of KN-93 and oleic acid (OA) on viability of SOD1G93A mutant NSC-34
  cells after overexpression and knockdown of Wnt5a. A-H. CaMKII-α, CaMKII-β and TAK1
  protein level were analyzed by western blotting. GAPDH served as the internal control.
  I, J. Line chart showing the viability of NSC-34 cells after transfection for different
  durations as determined by MTS assay. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. vs. pcDNA3.1-Con
  and pcDNA3.1-G93A-SOD1, siRNA-Con and pcDNA3.1-G93A-SOD1.
