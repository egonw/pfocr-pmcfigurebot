caption: 'Mechanisms of CRC inhibition by berry polyphenols. MDSC: myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells; RNI: reactive nitrogen intermediates; LOH: loss of heterozygosity;
  MSI: microsatellite instability. Berry polyphenols target tumor cells by inhibiting
  NF-kB and related pathways, COX-2, iNOS, and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. They affect the
  tumor microenvironment by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine release (TNF-c, IL-1,
  IL-6 and IL-10, GM-CSF, and IL-8), T-cell proliferation and MDSC activity, and causing
  a decrease in macrophage and neutrophils infiltrated. Berry polyphenols also inhibit
  aneuploidy by reducing LOH and suppressing the expression of DNMT, DNMT, CDKN2A,
  SFRP2, SFRPS, and WIF1 in the Wnt pathway.'
