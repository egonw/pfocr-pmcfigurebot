caption: The construction of DDX20-related gene regulatory network. (a) DDX20 related
  the pathway network of macrophage differentiation and growth inhibition by METS.
  (b) Two genes were overlapped in the intersection of DDX20-positive correlated genes
  and genes that involved macrophage differentiation and growth inhibition by METS.
  (b) Three miRNAâ€“two overlapped genes and DDX20 network generated by NetworkAnalyst
  software. The regulation network of 3 miRNAs (has-mir-4267, has-mir-6731-Sp, and
  has-mir-324-5p) and 3 mRNAs (DDX20, RBBP4, and SIN3A). (d) Pan-cancer expression
  analysis of has-mir-324-5p. (e) The has-mir-324-5p-targeted gene enrichment analysis
  via the CancerMIRNome database.
