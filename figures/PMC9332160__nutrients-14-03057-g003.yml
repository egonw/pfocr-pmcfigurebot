caption: mEVs altered colonic gene expression in DSS-induced colitis. (A) Principle
  component analysis (PCA) of the gene expression profiling in the colonic tissues.
  (B) Heatmap of hierarchical clustering for the transcriptional profiling in the
  12 colonic tissues. (C) Volcano plot of the alteration of colonic genes in response
  to mEVs (FC > 1.5/FC < 0.67, FDR < 0.05). (D) The relative abundance levels of partial
  inflammatory factors according to transcriptomic analysis. (E) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of the most significantly down-regulated pathways. (Fâ€“I) Heatmap of the
  inflammation-related pathways enriched in the significantly down-regulated genes.
