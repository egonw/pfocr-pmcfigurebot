caption: Qidantang Granule ameliorates renal injury by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway in DKD rats. The rats were administrated with 200 mg/kg Qidantang Granule
  by gavage for 9 weeks. qRT-PCR to detect the mRNA levels of Nephrin (A), Podocin
  (B), and Desmin (C) in the renal tissues of rats in each group; (D) Western blot
  to detect the protein levels of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, and mTOR in the
  renal tissues of rats in each group. (Eâ€“G) Quantification of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR.
  n=3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs DKD group.
