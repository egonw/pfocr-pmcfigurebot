figure_title: The role of the polyol pathway
caption: (A) Metabolic pathways leading to Mondo/ChREBP activation. Glucose-6-phosphate
  (Glucose-6-P), xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu-5-P), and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fructose-2,6-BP)
  were identified previously as MondoA/ChREBP-activating metabolites in mammalian
  cell culture systems (gray arrows) []. These metabolites are generated in glycolysis
  (blue arrows) or PPP (green arrow). Our study revealed that the polyol pathway (magenta
  arrows) has a significant contribution to activating Mondo/ChREBP in flies and mice
  (magenta arrows). (B) Physiological roles of the polyol pathway. The polyol pathway
  monitors glucose levels and regulates Mondo/ChREBP accordingly. This system allows
  animals to adjust metabolic activities to glucose availability and perform proper
  physiological functions. AR, aldose reductase; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element-binding
  protein; HK, hexokinase; Mlx, Max-like protein X; PFK1, phosphofructokinase 1; PFK2,
  phosphofructokinase 2; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Sodh, sorbitol dehydrogenase.
article_title: The polyol pathway is an evolutionarily conserved system for sensing
  glucose uptake.
