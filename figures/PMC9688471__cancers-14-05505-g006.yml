caption: Caspase-3 is essential for GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. (A) Representative
  bright-field images of HCT116 and CT26 cells after treatment with GA (2 μmol/L or
  1 μmol/L, 12 h) in the presence or absence of Z-DEVD-FMK (20 μmol/L). The white
  arrows point to pyroptotic cells. (B) GSDME and Cleaved caspase-3 expression levels
  were analysed by western blotting. The whole western blots were shown in . (C) The
  release of LDH and (D) flow cytometric analysis were performed after treatment of
  GA in the presence or absence of Z-DEVD-FMK (20 μmol/L). The cells were exposed
  to 0.1% DMSO as control. All experiments were repeated three times and results were
  expressed as mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01 vs. control.
