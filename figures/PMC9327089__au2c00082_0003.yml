caption: '(A) Schematic representation of the TASQ-stabilized G4-mediated DNA damage
  and related signaling pathway used to colocalize G4 and DNA damage sites (of note,
  the primary, anti-γH2AX antibody is removed for clarity). (B) High-resolution optical
  images of MCF7 cells treated with BioTriazoTASQ (1 μM, 24 h), tagged with Cy3-SA
  (green) after cell fixation (scale bar = 10 μm), which is followed by immunodetection
  of DNA damage foci (γH2AX, red) and chromatin staining by DAPI (blue). Inset and
  arrows highlight of the nucleoplasmic sites where both DSBs and TASQ colocalize.
  (C,D) Automated (C) or manual (D) quantification of γH2AX foci/cell, with or without
  TASQ treatment, and of the overlaps between green (TASQ) and red signals (γH2AX).
  (E) Modulation of the γH2AX, BioTriazoTASQ and common foci upon incubation of MCF7
  cells by PDS (5 μM, 6 h) and G4-labeling by BioTriazoTASQ (used after cell fixation;
  10 μM, overnight) and Cy3-SA. Statistics: p-values, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p
  < 0.001.'
