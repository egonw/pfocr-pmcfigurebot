figure_title: Hypothetical model for the activity of RAD51 and DMC1 nucleofilaments
caption: (A) During meiotic recombination, RAD51 and DMC1 polymerize on ssDNA to form
  nucleofilaments. DMC1 is the active nucleofilament but requires the presence of
  RAD51 nucleofilaments and additional co-factors. Presence of the DMC1 nucleofilament
  inactivates the RAD51 nucleofilament either through an unknown signaling pathway,
  through inhibiting interaction with co-factors or through nucleofilament remodeling.
  (B) In absence of RAD51, DMC1 does not form nucleofilaments and DSB repair is defective.
  (C) Absence of DMC1 allows normal polymerization of RAD51 and interaction with co-factors.
  RAD51 nucleofilaments are thus proficient for DSB repair using sister chromatid
  templates. This is reminiscent of the situation in mitosis (E) where RAD51 is the
  sole recombinase. Its polymerization and interaction with co-factors such as RAD54
  lead to an active nucleofilament proficient for DSB repair. (D and F) Addition of
  non-functional DMC1 (e.g. DMC1-GFP) in (D) meiosis or (F) mitosis, leads to RAD51
  down-regulation. In mitosis, DMC1 may be kept inactive presumably through absence
  of meiosis-specific co-factors or chromosomal features. We note that the spatial
  organization of recombinases and accessory factors depicted in the model is hypothetical
  and thus other organizations are possible (reviewer in [,,]). In particular, although
  the symmetrical loading of RAD51 and DMC1 is currently favored, it has been formally
  demonstrated in yeast only and it is not yet clear whether it applies for other
  organisms. This is particularly true for Arabidopsis where asymmetric loading has
  previously been suggested [].
