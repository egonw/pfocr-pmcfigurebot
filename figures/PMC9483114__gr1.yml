caption: The plant CoQ biosynthetic pathway.The plant-specific enzymes are shown in
  a green background. The B-ring of kaempferol contributes to the 4-HB pool. For 4-HB
  biosynthesis, 4-HB, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H,
  cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI,
  chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; PXA1,
  peroxisomal ABC transporter one; and UGTs, uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases.
  For the MVA pathway, HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA; MVA, mevalonate; MVAP,
  mevalonate 5-phosphate; MVAPP, mevalonate diphosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; AACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; MK, mevalonate kinase;
  PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MDD, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase; and IDI,
  isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase. For the CoQ pathway in mitochondria, GPP, geranyl
  diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; PPPP,
  polyprenyl-pyrophosphate; PPHB, polyprenyl-hydroxybenzoate; PPDHB, polyprenyl-dihydroxybenzoate;
  PPVA, polyprenyl-vanillic acid; DDMQ, demethoxy-demethyl-coenzyme Q; DMQ, demethoxy-coenzyme
  Q; and DMeQ, demethyl-coenzyme Q.
