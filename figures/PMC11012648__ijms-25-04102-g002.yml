caption: 'Notch signaling pathway and therapeutic interventions. Schematic representation
  depicting the therapeutic targets of the Notch signaling pathway. Delta-like ligand
  binding to the Notch receptor results in proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor,
  catalyzed by ADAM metalloproteases and γ-secretase to release the Notch intracellular
  domain. DLL: Delta-like ligand, NICD: Notch intracellular domain, ADAM17: A disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase 17, MAML: mastermind-like, CSL: CFB1/RBPJκ/Su(H)/LAG-1.'
