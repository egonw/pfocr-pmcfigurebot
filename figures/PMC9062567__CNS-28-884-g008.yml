caption: Circ_0055412 serves as a sponge for miR‐330‐3p. (A) RNA pull down assay was
  operated to examine the enrichment of predicted 7 miRNAs in the biotin‐labeled circ_0055412
  probe. (B) Binding regions between circ_0055412 and miR‐330‐3p was demonstrated.
  (C) The efficiency of miR‐330‐3p overexpression was examined by RT‐qPCR in glioma
  cells. (D) The luciferase activities in the circ_0055412‐Wt group and circ_0055412‐Mut
  group with miR‐330‐3p upregulation were checked by luciferase reporter assay. **p < 0.01
article_title: Knockdown of circ_0055412 promotes cisplatin sensitivity of glioma
  cells through modulation of CAPG and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
