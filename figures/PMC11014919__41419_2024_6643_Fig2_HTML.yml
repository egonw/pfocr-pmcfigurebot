figure_title: Biological functions of ANXA9 in breast cancer cells
caption: A The transfection efficiency of small interfering of ANXA9 in BC cells;
  B ANXA9 suppressed BC cellular proliferation via MTT assays; C The transfection
  efficiency of plasmids of ANXA9 in BC cells; D ANXA9 enhanced BC cellular proliferation
  via MTT assays; E–H ANXA9 affected BC cellular colony-forming ability; I, J Downregulation
  of ANXA9 induced early apoptosis in BC cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
  All of the experiments were replicated for three times.
