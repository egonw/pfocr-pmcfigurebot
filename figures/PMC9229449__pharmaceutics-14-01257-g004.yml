caption: 'Analysis of the human apoptosis array and IAPs in HO-3867 treated U2OS cells.
  (A) After treatment with 8 μM of HO-3867 for 24 h in U2OS cells, the human apoptosis
  array was employed. The increased proteins cleaved caspase-3 and HO-1 as well as
  the decreased proteins cIAP-1 and XIAP were subjected to quantitative analysis;
  (B) After experimental concentration range of HO-3867 treatment for 24 h, Western
  blot analysis was performed to measure expressions of HO-1, cIAP-1, and XIAP in
  U2OS and HOS cells. Then, quantitative analysis was assessed. n = 3. HO-1: U2OS:
  F = 601.182, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 3705.167, p < 0.001; cIAP-1: U2OS: F = 227.563,
  p < 0.001; HOS: F = 864.074, p < 0.001; XIAP: F = 227.563, p < 0.001; HOS: F = 864.074,
  p < 0.001. a Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to control. b Significantly
  different, p < 0.05, when compared to 2 μM. c Significantly different, p < 0.05,
  when compared to 4 μM. d Significantly different, p < 0.05, when compared to 8 μM.'
