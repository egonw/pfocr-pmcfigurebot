caption: Proposed pathway for metabolism of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH). PVOH is cleaved
  by extracellular enzymes, dehydrogenase, and oxidase. Subsequently, hydrolase and
  aldolase further break down to acetic acid, which is further metabolized through
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce energy, thereby releasing CO2 and
  water. Adapted from [,].
