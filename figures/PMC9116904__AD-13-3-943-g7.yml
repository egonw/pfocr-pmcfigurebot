caption: IL-1α, TNFα and C1q treated astrocyte expressed different transcripts in
  RNA-seq data. (A) Volcano plot showed the upregulated (red) and downregulated (green)
  genes between A1 and A0 astrocyte. The horizontal axis is log2fold change, and the
  vertical axis is -log10p value, p<0.05. Heatmap showed the overall distribution
  of differentially expressed genes. Gene expression data was colored red for high
  expression and blue for low expression. (B) GO enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes based on RNA-seq data with p-value showed top 10 upregulated biological
  process. (C) KEGG enrichment top 20 analysis suggested that TNF signaling pathway
  and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction were related with the phenotypic changes
  of astrocytes.
