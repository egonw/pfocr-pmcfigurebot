caption: MD simulation trajectory analysis of test systems during 150 ns simulation
  period. (A) RMSD plot of UGSC (blue), DGSC (yellow) and RGSC (green). (B) RMSF plot
  of UGSC (blue), DGSC (yellow) and RGSC (green). (C) Rg plot of UGSC (blue), DGSC
  (yellow) and RGSC (green). (D) SASA plot of UGSC (blue), DGSC (yellow) and RGSC
  (green). (E) Average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed in UGSC (blue),
  DGSC (yellow) and RGSC (green). (F) Average number of hydrogen bonds formed between
  rutin and GS. (G) Average number of hydrogen bonds formed between GS and surrounding
  solvent in UGSC (blue), DGSC (yellow) and RGSC (green). (H) Average number of hydrogen
  bonds formed between DAPT and GS.
