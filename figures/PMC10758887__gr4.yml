caption: According to the amyloid cascade theory, red arrows represent the primary
  pathogenic pathway for AD, whereas thinner brown arrows represent the minor contributory
  pathways. Even though risk factors like age and ApoE genotype both have a significant
  impact on AÎ² aggregation in transgenic models and post-mortem AD brain, there is
  less evidence to support the theory's applicability to sporadic AD ().
