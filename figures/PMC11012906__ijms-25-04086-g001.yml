caption: Basal expression analysis of miR-21 and RECK gene expression in HPV-transformed
  tumor cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of miR-21 (panel A) and RECK
  (panel B) gene expression on HaCaT, CaSki, and SiHa cells in basal conditions. Total
  RNA and cDNA synthesis were obtained from 1 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate
  containing DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Relative expression by real-time RT-qPCR analysis
  of miR-21 was calculated using the 2−∆Ct method and was analyzed by miR-21/mRNA
  RNAU6 ratio relative expression units. The analysis of RECK was calculated by mRNA
  RECK/mRNA GAPDH ratio relative expression units. The Ct values were normalized with
  HaCaT, CaSki, and SiHa cells untreated and are presented as mean ± SD. p values
  < 0.05 are indicated with an asterisk.
