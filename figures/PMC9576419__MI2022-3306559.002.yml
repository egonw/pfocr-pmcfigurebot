caption: 'Effects of visfatin on LPS-induced cardiac injury in mice. (a) The survival
  rates in the four groups were analyzed during follow up; N = 10 − 15 in each group.
  (b and c) The expression levels of CK-MB and LDH in both the serum and heart were
  examined. (d–f) LVEDD, LVESD, LVEF, FS, +dp/dt max, and −dp/dt max in each group
  were detected. N = 5 − 10 in each group. ∗p < 0.05 vs. the saline + PBS group. #p
  < 0.05 vs. the LPS + PBS group. SL means saline; VFT means visfatin.'
