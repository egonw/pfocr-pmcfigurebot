caption: NF-κB pathway mediated BD serum-treated M1-like macrophage polarization.
  A Representative western blot images (upper) and summary (lower) of NF-κB p65, phospho-p65
  and IκBα of macrophages treated with BD (n=3) serum or HC (n=3) serum. Macrophages
  were pretreated with DHE and then were stimulated with BD serum for 48 h. B Representative
  histograms (left) and summary (right) of CD86 expression on DHE-treated and untreated
  macrophages stimulated with BD (n=6) serum and HC (n=6) serum. C TNF-α production
  by DHE-treated and untreated macrophages stimulated with BD serum (n=6) and HC (n=6)
  serum. Data were shown as mean±SD. *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01, ***, p<0.001, ****, p<0.001
  by two-way ANOVA. MBD, BD serum- treated macrophages; MHC, HC serum- treated macrophages
