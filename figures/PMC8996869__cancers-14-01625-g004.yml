caption: Flow chart describing the profiling of Akt1-regulated mRNAs in human PC3
  and DU145 PCa cells. Among the 770 mRNAs analyzed using the NanoString® technology,
  547 mRNAs in DU145 cells and 629 mRNAs in PC3 cells were found to be modulated by
  Akt1 gene silencing. Out of the 448 matched mRNAs from DU145 and PC3 cells with
  Akt1 loss (323 up- and 125 downregulated), there were 19 upregulated cancer promoters
  and 6 downregulated cancer suppressors, which were subjected for bioinformatics
  analysis using the Ingenuity, dbEMT, and cBioportal databases to identify the key
  Akt1-regulated miRNAs modulating PCa cell EMT.
