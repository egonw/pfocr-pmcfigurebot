figure_title: Downregulation of KCTD9 expression is correlated with disease progression
  and prognosis
caption: A, B Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test for CRC patients from the TCGA-COAD
  dataset stratified according to median KCTD9 expression levels. Cases with low KCTD9
  expression were associated with significantly poorer overall survival (OS) (A) and
  disease-specific survival (DSS) (B).
article_title: KCTD9 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by decreasing the level of
  β-catenin in colorectal cancer.
