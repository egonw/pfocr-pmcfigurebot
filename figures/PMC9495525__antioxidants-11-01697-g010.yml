caption: 'Effects of OLNZ in H2O2-induced neuronal cell death in vitro: (A) The non-toxic
  concentration of OLNZ in SH-SY5Y cells was estimated using the MTT assay; (B) Cell
  viability in H2O2-mediated toxicity was also evaluated using the MTT assay; (C)
  The release of cytotoxic marker LDH (%); and (D) the oxidative stress marker ROS
  was examined. Data were expressed as the mean Â± SEM, and the experiment was repeated
  three times. # and * indicate a statistically significant difference compared with
  the control and H2O2 treatment alone, respectively, p < 0.05. the oxidative stress
  marker.'
