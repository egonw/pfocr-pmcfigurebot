figure_title: The Wnt5a-ROR2 signaling pathway controls inflammasome activation during
  OIH development
caption: A Morphine activated the inflammasome in the spinal cord as measured by the
  upregulation of Cas-1 and IL-1β. Morphine-induced inflammasome activation was impaired
  by AC-YVAD-CMK (YVAD), a selective inhibitor of Cas-1. B YVAD impaired the expression
  of mechanical OIH. Morphine was administered according the paradigm shown in , and
  YVAD was administered daily on the first 4 days (4 nmol/kg, i.t.). C Cas-1 siRNA
  (Cas-si) but not mismatch (silencer negative control) siRNA (Mis-si) blocked mechanical
  OIH expression. siRNA was administered daily on the first 4 days (3 nmol/kg, i.t.).
  D Morphine-induced inflammasome activation, measured by Cas-1 immunoblotting, was
  blocked by neuronal Wnt5a-CKO-S or astrocytic ROR2 CKO. E Immunoblotting analysis
  of spinal phosphorylated and total JNK in wild type or ROR2 CKO mice treated with
  morphine according to the paradigm shown in . Morphine-induced phosphorylation of
  JNK were blocked by astrocytic ROR2 CKO. F Immunoblotting analysis of pro-IL-1β
  and IL-1β in the spinal cord of wild type mice treated with saline, SP600125, morphine
  or SP + morphine. SP was intrathecally administered (10 μg/5 μl) at 0,2,4,6 day
  and 30 min prior to morphine injection. Mice were euthanized for spinal cord collection
  at day 7 (n = 4/group). Morphine-induced IL-1β activation was blocked by p-JNK inhibitor
  SP600125. G Immunoblotting analysis of Pro-Cas-1 and Cas-1 in the spinal cord of
  wild type mice treated with saline, SP600125, morphine or SP + morphine. Morphine-induced
  Cas-1 activation was blocked by p-JNK inhibitor SP600125. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ns, p > 0.05.
