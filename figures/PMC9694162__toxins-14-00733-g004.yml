caption: Role of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in alleviation of ZEA-induced TM4
  cell injury by RSV. TM4 cells were exposed to ZEA (20 μmol·L−1) for 24 h after pretreatment
  with RSV (2.5 μmol·L−1) for 3 h after transfection with NC siRNA or Nrf2 siRNA,
  using Lipofectamine™ 3000 for 12 h. (A) Expression levels of Nrf2/Keap1 and nuclear-Nrf2/Histone-H3
  relative proteins (total protein and nuclear protein). (B) Expression levels of
  HO-1 relative proteins in TM4 cells. (C,D) Expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 relative
  proteins. (E) The viability of TM4 cells detected by CCK-8 assay. (F) Intracellular
  ROS levels of TM4 cells were assessed using a DCFH-DA ROS assay kit. The ROS levels
  were analyzed by flow cytometry. (G) Flow cytometry analysis of TM4 cell apoptosis
  was detected using an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit. Different letters (a, b,
  c, d) represent a significant difference (p < 0.05 calculated by ANOVA (A,B,E–G)
  or a t-test (C,D) for each group), while the same letters indicate no significant
  difference between groups.
