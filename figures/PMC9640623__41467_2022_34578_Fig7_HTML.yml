figure_title: SAMHD1 acetylation at K354 causes genomic instability
caption: a U2OS cells were transfected with SAMHD1-GFP WT, K354R, K354Q, or an empty
  vector and silenced with SAMHD1 or a NT siRNA control. Lysates were run on SDS-PAGE
  and probed with the indicated antibodies. b, c U20S cells were transfected with
  siRNA against SAMHD1 or a NT siRNA control and also transfected with empty vector
  or vector expressing WT, K354R, or K354Q SAMHD1. Cells were subjected to immunofluorescence
  analysis with antibodies against p-CHK2 and GFP and DNA was stained with DAPI. The
  number of p-CHK2 foci per nucleus was counted. Shown are a representative image
  (b) and quantification of p-CHK2 foci represented by mean and SD of 50 cells from
  3 independent experiments (c). P values (***p < 0.001) were determined using Ordinary
  one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test analysis. ns non-significant. d Model
  showing SAMDH1 deacetylation at K354 by SIRT1 in promoting DNA end resection and
  HR. In response to DSBs, SIRT1 complexes with and deacetylates SAMHD1 at K354, facilitating
  its recruitment and binding to ssDNA and ssDNA overhangs at DSBs. SAMHD1 binding
  to ssDNA at DSBs in turn facilitates CtIP binding to DSBs to promote DNA end resection
  and HR. Dysregulation of this pathway impairs DNA end resection and HR, leading
  to genomic instability. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
