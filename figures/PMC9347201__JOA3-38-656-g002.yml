caption: Entrainment from the RVA showed minor constant fusion. (A) Entrainment pacing
  with a cycle length of 320 ms followed by tachycardia. (B) Entrainment pacing with
  a cycle length of 310 ms. (C) Exclusive pacing with a cycle length of 320 ms during
  sinus rhythm immediately after entrainment study at the same RVA site. Considering
  the effects of hemodynamics and respiratory status, the pacing study was performed
  consecutively and speedily as shown by the time description. Red arrows during exclusive
  pacing indicate different QRS morphologies from those during entrainment pacing.
