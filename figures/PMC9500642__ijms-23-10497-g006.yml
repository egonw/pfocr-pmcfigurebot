caption: 'LPA−induced KLF5 expression is regulated by the MAPK and AKT signaling pathways
  in HK-2 cells. (A) HK-2 cells were transfected with a control siRNA (siCon) or LPAR1
  siRNA (siLPAR1) and treated with or without 20 μM LPA for 30 min. (B) HK-2 cells
  were pretreated with the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), PD 98059 (PD; an extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor; 10 μM), SP600125 (SP; a c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) inhibitor; 10 μM), or LY 294002 (LY; a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine
  kinase (AKT) inhibitor; 2.5 μM) for 1 h, and subsequently treated with or without
  20 μM LPA for 30 min. Protein levels of (A) p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-AKT, and (B) KLF5
  were analyzed via Western blotting, quantified using ImageJ software, and normalized
  to those of total ERK, total JNK, total AKT, and β-actin, respectively. Representative
  images (left) and quantitative analysis bar graphs (right) are shown (n = 3 independent
  experiments). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.005 vs. siCon + BSA or Con; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.005 vs. siCon
  + LPA or LPA.'
