caption: Irradiation (IR)‐induced programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression
  is cGAS–STING pathway‐dependent but DNA repair signaling‐independent. (A) Percentage
  of micronucleated cells (top) and Hoechst staining of nonirradiated (non‐IR) KYSE‐450
  cells (bottom left) and cells exposed to 30 Gy/10 fr (bottom right). Micronuclei
  are indicated by the yellow arrows. Scale bar = 50 µm. *P < .05, Student’s t test.
  (B) Protein expression analysis of molecules upstream of PD‐L1 in KYSE‐450 cells
  to evaluate their expression in response to the indicated fractionated radiotherapy.
  GAPDH was used as a loading control

  reaction induced by fractionated irradiation.
