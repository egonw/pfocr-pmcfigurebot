caption: The miRNA regulatory network of hub genes. (A) PPI network of known differentially
  expressed mRNAs. Circles are colored from blue to red, representing higher connectivity
  of mRNAs in the network. (B) Differential expression levels of hub genes. ***P < 0.001.
  CSF coronary slow flow, NC healthy controls. (C) Predicted drugs targeted by hub
  genes in Therapeutic Target Database. (D) MiRNAs regulated hub gene to participate
  in biological functions. Triangle represents hub gene; diamond represents KEGG pathway;
  ellipse represents GO terms; V represents miRNAs.
