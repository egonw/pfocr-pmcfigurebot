caption: ITGA5 is necessary for AFAP1L1 mediated GC migration, invasion and EMT. A
  Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to determine the role of
  ITGA5 in mediating the influence of AFAP1L1 on GC cells migratory and invasive ability.
  Scale bars, 50 μm. B Double fluorescent staining of cytoskeleton (red) and p-FAK
  (green) for indicated GC cells. Cytoskeleton was stained by rhodamine phalloidin
  and Nuclei was stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 10 μm. C Adhesion assays to
  test cell-ECM adhesion capacity of indicated GC cells. BSA was used as negative
  control. D qRT-PCR analysis of ITGA5, E-cadherin and vimentin expression in AFAP1L1-interfered
  GC cells with ITGA5 further overexpression or knockdown. E Western blot analysis
  of ITGA5, E-cadherin and vimentin, FAK and ERK in AFAP1L1-interfered GC cells with
  ITGA5 further overexpression or knockdown. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001

  to facilitate CDC42-mediated activation of ITGA5 signaling pathway.
