caption: Mechanism of alteration of iron metabolism in COVID 19. The release of IL-6
  increases the production of C reactive protein a marker of systemic inflammation
  from the liver, similarly, this also leads to an increase in the synthesis of an
  iron regulating peptide called Hepcidin (covidin in COVID) and decrease the production
  of transferrin and internalisation of ferroportin. Hepcidin is also released by
  the macrophages due to the action of IL-6. Hepcidin is a major intracellular regulator
  of iron by triggering the ferroportin leading to increased intracellular iron. So,
  this Iron-hepcidin/covidin-transferrin axis is a major pathway responsible for the
  decreased iron in inflammatory.
