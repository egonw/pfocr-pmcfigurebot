caption: Pathway level enrichment of enhancer mutations. A, Scatter plot shows the
  over-representation of genes with enhancer mutations in the KEGG pathway. The x-axis
  represents the ratio of the overlapping genes to the total number of genes in the
  pathway. The size of the circle denotes the number of genes in overlap, and the
  color shows the negative logarithmic adjusted P value. B, Mutational landscape of
  the PI3K–AKT pathway. Co-mutation plot showing druggable PI3K–AKT signaling pathway
  genes (y-axis) affected in lung cancer samples (x-axis) by mutations in enhancers,
  promoters, and exons as indicated in the legend on the right. The top stacked bar
  plot shows the number of mutations in each sample, and the gene-wise mutation rate
  is displayed on the right. C, Network view of protein interactions among two sub-networks
  of regulation of transcription by RNA Pol II identified by HotNet2. Interactions
  between proteins in the sub-network from each interaction network are colored on
  the basis of a P value. D, Significantly altered gene sets (MSigDB-C2 curated).
  The violin plot shows the gene sets that are affected by TGEM. E, Hierarchical clustering
  graph of the WAKASUGI_HAVE_ZNF143_BINDING_SITES gene set from MSigDB C2 gene set.
  The gene plot shows the P value associated with the impact of the enhancer mutation
  on the gene expression. The part of the clustering graph with a significant P value
  is plotted in black.
