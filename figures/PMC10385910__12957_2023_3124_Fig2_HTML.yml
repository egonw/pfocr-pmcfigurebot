caption: TRIM58 overexpression inhibited cell viability and cell cycle progression
  in CRC. SW620 cells were transduced with TRIM58 expression vector. A Cell viability
  was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. B, C Cell cycle was measured
  through flow cytometry. D Protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, p21, and cyclin D1 were
  measured using Western blotting. ***p < 0.001 vs. oeNC
article_title: TRIM58 functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by promoting
  RECQL4 ubiquitination to inhibit the AKT signaling pathway.
