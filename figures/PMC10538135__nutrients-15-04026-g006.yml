caption: The interaction network of DEMs induced by different basic amino acids (A–C).
  The size of each node is positively related to the number of the degree, and the
  top 6 metabolites having the highest degrees were labeled with names. The pathway
  enrichments of DEMs between individual basic amino acid treatments and the Con group
  in 4 INS-1 β-cells (D–F). DEMs, differentially expressed metabolites.
