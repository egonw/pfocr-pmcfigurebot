caption: Establishment of heterozygous knockin at rs1617640 (A/C) in HEK-293 cells
  using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology alongside piggyBac transposon system(A)
  Schematic of the generation of a SNP knockin model of rs1617640 using CRISPR-Cas9
  gene editing alongside the piggyBac transposon system. The location of rs1617640
  (A/A) and the site at which the gRNA is designed to introduce a DSB within the wild-type
  sequence of HEK-293 cells is shown in the top panel. Two homology arms either side
  of the closest TTAA site are designed with one (5′ arm) containing the desired gene
  edit at rs1617640 (C/C). The two homology arms are cloned into the targeting construct
  either side of the piggyBac transposon carrying the selectable markers, puroΔtk.
  Upon introduction of a DSB at the site targeted by the gRNA, DNA repair via homologous
  recombination due to the presence of the homologous arms is initiated and the the
  piggyBac transposon becomes integrated into the genomic DNA at the TTAA site. After
  selection with puromycin, clones with mutation-corrected lines were identified and
  transiently transfected with piggyBac transposase plasmid, followed by FIAU treatment
  to eliminate piggyBac-containing clones. Mutation-corrected heterozygous clones
  for rs1617640 (A/C genotype) were isolated with no marks remaining within the genomic
  DNA.(B) Sanger sequencing results of the sequence at each stage of the CRISPR-Cas9
  and piggyBac transposon technique. The top panel represents the wild-type sequence
  at rs1617640 and the wild-type sequences up- and downstream of the TTAA site prior
  to gene editing. The middle panel represents the mutated sequence at rs1617640 and
  the insertion of the piggyBac transposon sequence at the TTAA site following homologous
  recombination after successful introduction of the DSB. The bottom panel represents
  the seamless excision of the piggyBac transposon from the genomic DNA. The yellow
  highlighted region represents the gRNA sequence.(C) PCR gel electrophoresis confirming
  the insertion of the piggyBac transposon in clones 61 and 67.(D) PCR gel electrophoresis
  confirming successful removal of the piggyBac transposon from the genome following
  treatment with the transposase in clone 7-3.(E) qRT-PCR of EPO to validate rs1617640
  as causal in controlling EPO mRNA expression levels. The graph shows the relative
  change in mRNA expression levels (+/− SEM) between genotypes (A/A and A/C).(F) qRT-PCR
  of genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway (HEY2, DTX3L, and PARP9) and two
  control genes (PPIA and POLR2A). EPO was repeated again as a positive control for
  altered expression for comparison. The graph shows the relative change in mRNA expression
  levels (+/− SEM) between genotypes. Columns and error bars in (E) and (F) represent
  mean and SEM values. Paired t test was performed. ns, non-significant; ∗p ≤ 0.05,
  ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001.
