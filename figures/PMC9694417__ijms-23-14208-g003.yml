caption: The expression of IAA-signaling genes in AZs treated with TDZ at different
  temperatures. (A) The heatmap is generated based on the RNA-seq data. The number
  in the box indicates the fold-change expression of the gene (only those with a ≥one-fold
  difference are shown). TDZ-induced downregulated and upregulated expressions are
  indicated by blue and red colors, respectively. I, II, and III represent three types,
  respectively. All the numbers in the heatmap represent fold changes; (B) the expression
  levels of selected genes from real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The Y-axis indicates
  log2FC values. Data represent the means ± SD of three biological replicates, and
  each biological replicate contains three technical replicates. The same as below.
