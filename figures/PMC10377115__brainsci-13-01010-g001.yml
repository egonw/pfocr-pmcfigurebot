caption: 'This figure depicts the hypothalamus’s function following exposure to significant
  stress or traumatic events. The hypothalamus activates two distinct pathways in
  response to stress: the ANS (specifically, the sympathetic nervous system) and the
  HPA axis. The sympathetic nervous system acts faster by releasing noradrenaline
  and adrenaline from the adrenal medulla, while the HPA axis pathway acts slower
  by releasing glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. CRH, primarily released from
  the hypothalamus, initiates the HPA axis. Along with AVP, CRH affects the anterior
  pituitary to release ACTH, which drives the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoid
  hormones such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rats, mice, birds, and
  most reptiles. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is associated with several mental disorders,
  including PTSD, depression, and schizophrenia. Understanding the complex interplay
  between the ANS and the HPA axis can provide insight into the physiological response
  to stress and the development of mental disorders. ANS: the autonomic nervous system;
  CRH: corticotropin-releasing hormone; HPA: hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal; AVP:
  arginine vasopressin; ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone; PTSD: post-traumatic stress
  disorder; NE: norepinephrine, E: epinephrine.'
