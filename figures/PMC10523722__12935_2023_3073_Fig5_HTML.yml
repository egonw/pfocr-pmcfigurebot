caption: FAP stimulates ccRCC cellular migratory capacity as well as invasion in vitro.
  A, B Wound-healing tests were conducted 24 h following transfection to assess the
  migration patterns of Caki-1 as well as ACHN cells. C, D After transfection, Caki-1
  as well as ACHN cells were tested for transwell migration. E, F Transwell invasion
  tests with Matrigel-coated membranes were conducted to determine the invasion ability
  of Caki-1 as well as ACHN cells following transfection. *p < 0.05 vs. the Ctrl group
article_title: FAP promotes clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression via activating
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
