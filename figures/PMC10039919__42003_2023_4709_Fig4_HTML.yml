figure_title: Gene expression analyses of 2- and 2e-treated Col-0 and jaz9-1 seedlings
caption: 'a Principal component analysis of upregulated genes in each compound-treated
  6-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings by RNAseq analyses (fold change >2.5, FDR < 0.1).
  Black, blue, red, and green dots showed three independent replicates of each treatment.
  b Venn diagram (FDR < 0.1) indicates the number of upregulated genes at least 2.5-fold
  change in response to different treatments. c Heatmap illustrating changes in gene
  expression of jasmonate response to different treatments (FDR < 0.1). Each GO ID
  is as follows: Regulation of JA mediated signaling pathway: 2000022, Response to
  JA: 0009753, Defense response: 0006952, Metabolic process: 0008152. d Venn diagram
  (FDR < 0.1) indicating the number of downregulated genes at least 2.5-fold change
  in response to different treatments and GO enrichment analysis. e Gene expression
  analyses of cell wall organization-related genes by RT-qPCR in Col-0 and coi1-1
  seedlings (n = 4) with or without compound treatment (1 µM) for 8 h. Similar results
  were obtained in three independent experiments. Significant differences were evaluated
  by one-way ANOVA/Tukey HSD post hoc test (p < 0.05). Values are mean ± SE. f Venn
  diagram (FDR < 0.1) indicating the number of upregulated genes at least 2.5-fold
  change in response to different treatments in Col-0 and jaz9-1. g RT-qPCR analyses
  in Col-0 and jaz9-1 seedling (n = 4) with or without compound treatment (1 µM).
  Each relative expression fold was calculated using an average expression level in
  Mock- or 2e-treated Col-0 or jaz9-1 seedlings. Similar results were obtained in
  three independent experiments. Significant differences were evaluated by Student’s
  t-test (**p < 0.01, *p < 0.05; ns, not significant). Values are mean ± SE.'
