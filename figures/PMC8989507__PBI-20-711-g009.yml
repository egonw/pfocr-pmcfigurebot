caption: Pathway schematic of native and alternative photorespiration pathways. Alternative
  glycolate metabolism pathway (AP3) schematic. Chloroplast, peroxisome, and mitochondria
  based enzymatic reactions or transport steps of the native photorespiratory pathway
  (grey, solid lines) and AP3 (green, dashed lines) are shown. In AP3, the native
  glycolate‚Äêglycerate transporter PLGG1 is downregulated via RNAi suppression to increase
  metabolic flux through the alternative metabolic pathway.

  at elevated temperatures in a model crop.
