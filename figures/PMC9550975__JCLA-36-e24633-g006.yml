caption: 'CDCA8 silencing reversed the activating effect of KIF18B overexpression
  on the mTORC1 pathway in ESCC cells. Both EC9706 and KYSE220 cells were transfected
  with KIF18B overexpression plasmids or/and siCDCA8. (A–E) Western blot was used
  to assess the impacts of CDCA8 on mTORC1 pathway‐related proteins p‐p70S6K, p70S6K,
  p‐mTOR, and mTOR in the ESCC cells. GAPDH served as a loading control. All experiments
  had gone through three repetitions. **p < .01, ***p < .001 versus Vector; #p < .05,
  ##p < .01, ###p < .001 versus KIF18B + Vector. CDCA8, cell division cycle associated
  8; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase; KIF18B, kinesin family member
  18B; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; p, phosphorylated'
article_title: Upregulation of KIF18B facilitates malignant phenotype of esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma by activating CDCA8/mTORC1 pathway.
