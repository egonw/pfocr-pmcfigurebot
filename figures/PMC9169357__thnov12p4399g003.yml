caption: 'The ECM-integrin pathway is a potential downstream mediator of dysadherin
  with tumorigenesis. (A) GSEA was performed using the mRNA sequencing profiles of
  dysadherin-KO and control (EV-transfected) cells. Gene signatures associated with
  the ECM-integrin pathway were significantly enriched in control cells compared with
  dysadherin-KO cells. (B,C) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed with the list
  of differentially expressed genes in dysadherin-KO cells to reveal the dysadherin-associated
  mechanism. (B) Disease and function analyses show significant reductions in tumor
  frequency, tumor incidence, and malignant tumor development upon dysadherin KO.
  Categories with p < 0.05 and |z-score| > 2 were considered statistically significant.
  (C) Upstream analysis indicates the potential link between integrin pathways and
  reduced cancer-related functions, with significant reductions in integrin target
  gene expression upon dysadherin KO, which collectively led to a decrease in tumor
  development. (D,E) The potential relationship between dysadherin and the integrin
  signaling pathway, validated by RT-qPCR analyses of integrin target genes and by
  IF in SW480 (D) and HCT116 (E) cell lines. RT-qPCR heatmaps show changes in integrin
  signaling target genes upon dysadherin KO (D) and OE (E). IF staining for human
  active β1 integrin (12G10) and dysadherin in dysadherin-KO or -OE CRC cells. (F)
  IF staining for murine active β1 integrin (9EG7) and dysadherin in intestinal tumor
  tissues of ApcMin/+;Fxyd5+/+ and ApcMin/+;Fxyd5-/- mice (n = 8/ group).*** indicates
  p < 0.001. Dys: dysadherin, FC: fold change, FDR: false discovery rate, MFI: mean
  fluorescence intensity, NES: normalized enrichment score, EV: empty vector.'
