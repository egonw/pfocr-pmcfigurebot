caption: 'Resveratrol (RSV) induces apoptosis in A549 cells. Cells were treated with
  various concentrations of RSV for 48 h. (A) Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was used
  to detect the proportion of early apoptotic cells, late apoptotic and necrotic cells,
  and normal cells; (B) TUNEL-FITC/PI staining was used to detect the percentage of
  apoptosis cells; (C) Apoptosome observed under TEM; (D) Transcriptional expression
  of BAX and BCL-2 as determined by qRT-PCR. ACTB was used as an internal control;
  (E) Protein expression of BAX and BCL-2 as determined by Western blot. ACTB was
  used as an internal control; (F) QRT-PCR analysis of mRNA level of BAX and BCL-2
  in the cells treated with or without 80 μM RSV or 30 μM Z-VAD-FMK. ACTB was used
  as an internal control; (G) Western blot assay of protein levels of BAX and BCL-2
  in the cells treated with or without 80 μM RSV or 30 μM Z-VAD-FMK. ACTB was used
  as an internal control. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of triplicate tests.
  * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group. ## p < 0.01 compared
  with 80 μM RSV group.'
