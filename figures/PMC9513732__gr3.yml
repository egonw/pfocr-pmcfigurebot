caption: Transcriptional changes and functional enrichment analysis among differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) between BCS192 and BCS297 in four developmental stages. A.
  Statistic of differentially expressed genes including up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes in each comparison groups between BCS192 and BCS297. The expression changes
  of all genes were analyzed by performing pair-wise comparisons of BCS192 and BCS297
  in four developmental stages. Samples at 7, 14,21, and 28 DPA group, respectively
  (7 vs 7, 14vs 14, 21 vs 21, 28 vs 28). Red indicates genes that were up-regulated
  in BCS297 compared with BCS192, while blue indicates genes that were down-regulated,
  log2FC = 1. B. Venn diagram analysis of grain development-related DEGs in BCS297
  and BCS192 across four time points (7 vs 7, 14 vs 14, 21 vs 21, and 28 vs 28 DPA).
  log2FC = 1. C. Clustering and heatmap of 1,131 common DEGs based on their expression
  profiles in BCS192 and BCS297 across four comparison groups (7 vs 7, 14 vs 14, 21
  vs 21, and 28 vs 28 DPA). Numbers ranging from −10 to 10 indicate the multiples
  of difference. D. GO enrichment of 540 commonly up-regulated DEGs during four grain
  developing stages. Red pentacles represent putative GO terms related to β-glucan
  content. E. KEGG pathway enrichment of 540 commonly up-regulated DEGs in four grain
  developing stages. The blue box indicates significantly enriched pathways and red
  pentacles represent putative KEGG pathways related to β-glucan content. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article.)
