caption: Localization of the Nrf2 protein and ARE gene activity in MODE-K cells with
  PC-induced concentrations and time gradients. (a) Cells were treated with 0, 1,
  2.5, and 5 μg/mL PC for 24 h (40x). (b) Cells were treated with 5 μg/mL PC for 0,
  3, 6, 12, and 24 h (40x). (c) Effects of PC on ARE gene activity in MODE-K cells.
  All tests were repeated at least three times. “∗” represents P < 0.05 compared with
  the control group, and “∗∗” represents P < 0.01 compared with the control group.
