caption: GO terms and pathway enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in cryopreserved sperm in blue catfish, Ictalurus furcatus. (A) Enriched
  functional GO terms for upregulated genes in cryopreserved sperm compared to fresh-frozen
  sperm with a cut-off of 竏値og10(p-value) > 5. Enrichment scores measured by 竏値og10(p-value)
  were shown on the x-axis. (B) Network plot of enriched GO terms of upregulated genes
  after cryopreservation. GO term nodes were represented by the same color as in (A).
  (C) Enriched functional KEGG pathways for upregulated genes in cryopreserved sperm
  compared to fresh-frozen sperm with a cut-off of 竏値og10(p-value) > 2. (D) Enriched
  functional reactome pathways for upregulated genes in cryopreserved sperm compared
  to fresh-frozen sperm with a cut-off of 竏値og10(p-value) > 3. (E) Enriched functional
  GO terms for downregulated genes in cryopreserved sperm compared to fresh-frozen
  sperm.
