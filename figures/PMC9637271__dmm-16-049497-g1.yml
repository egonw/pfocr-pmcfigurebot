caption: Frataxin knockdown impairs mitochondrial respiration in induced cardiomyocytes
  (iCMs). (A) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) representation of electron transport
  chain (ETC) subunits downregulated following frataxin knockdown in iCMs (shown in
  green). Number of biological replicates=4. (B) Box and whisker plots showing normalized
  counts for aconitase (ACO2), citrate synthase (CS), fumarate hydratase (FH) and
  succinyl dehydrogenase (SDHA) in iCMs transfected twice with control sc2 (blue)
  or siFx2 (orange). Boxes represent the 25-75th percentiles, and the medians are
  indicated. The whiskers show the furthest data point within 1.5 times the interquartile
  range from each box end. Number of biological replicates=4; ****P-adj<0.0001; ***P-adj<0.001;
  **P-adj<0.01 using DESeq2 (). (C) Average maximal respiratory capacity (left) and
  spare capacity (right) are lower in iCMs transfected once with siFxn (orange) versus
  control (sc1; blue). Data are represented as weighted averages±composite s.d. calculated
  for the four biological replicates. ***P<0.001 (unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test).
  (D) Average ATP production (left) and basal respiration (right) are statistically
  unchanged in iCMs transfected once with siFxn (orange) versus control (sc1; blue).
  Data are represented as weighted averages±composite s.d. calculated for the four
  biological replicates.
