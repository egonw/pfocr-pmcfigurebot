caption: 'Thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) induces transcriptional responses in the
  kidney. A: volcano plots of bulk RNA-sequencing data showing profiles of genes differentially
  expressed among all measured genes in kidney samples obtained from uninjured control
  mice (n = 3), spinal cord transection at thoracic level 3 (T3Tx) SCI mice (n = 3),
  and spinal cord transection at thoracic level 10 (T10Tx) SCI mice (n = 3) at 4 wk
  postinjury. B: scatterplots of pathway analysis showing the top 10 overrepresented
  pathways that were significantly perturbed. The blue-circled red dots in the intact
  versus T3Tx plot (left) are cytokine-cytokine receptor and chemokine signaling pathways;
  the only circled red dot in the intact versus T10Tx plot (right) represents a cytokine-cytokine
  receptor signaling pathway. C: dendrograms from Gene Ontology analysis showing terms
  of biological processes (top) and cellular components (bottom) with high enrichment
  of member gene sets.'
