figure_title: UBE3A is a target of miR-375
caption: A Overlaps of miR-375 predicted targets from 5 public databases and the differentially
  expressed genes determined by RNA sequencing after miR-375 was overexpressed in
  SK-MES-1 cells, and five genes were selected. B, C The expression of five selected
  genes in unpaired (B) and paired (C) LUSC (n = 502) and normal tissues (n = 49)
  from TCGA. D RNA-seq, E qRT‒PCR and F western blotting were carried out to verify
  the relationship between miR-375 and UBE3A. GAPDH served as an internal control
  for the detection of UBE3A mRNA. G IHC assay displaying UBE3A expression between
  cancer and adjacent normal tissues, with magnifications of ×40 and ×200, respectively.
  H Quantitative immunohistochemistry analysis of UBE3A in LUSC and paracarcinoma
  tissues. I ROC curve analysis for differentiating normal from tumor tissue, with
  an AUC of 0.892. J Relationship between UBE3A expression and OS was assessed by
  a Kaplan–Meier plot. The log-rank test was conducted to explore statistical significance
  based on the survival curves. K Correlation between UBE3A and miR-375 expression
  levels in LUSC tissues (n = 89 patients). L The putative binding sites of miR-375
  within the 3’UTR of UBE3A mRNA predicted by the TargetScan database. M Luciferase
  reporter assays were carried out in HEK293T cells cotransfected with miR-375 expression
  vector or control vector with the luciferase reporter plasmid containing either
  wild‐type (WT) or mutant (MUT) 3′UTR of UBE3A to confirm the regulation of UBE3A
  by miR-375.
