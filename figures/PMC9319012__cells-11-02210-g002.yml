caption: RSV and RELA regulate intracellular N-glycosylation of the integrin signaling
  pathway. N-glycoproteins were identified in cytoplasmic proteins from control and
  RSV-infected cells in the presence or absence of RELA silencing. (A) Agglomerative
  hierarchical clustering of 171 peptides significantly changed across the treatment
  conditions. Data was Z-scored across the row prior to clustering using Euclidian
  distance. The legend is at right. Each row represents an individual peptide; columns
  refer to different cell treatments/conditions. Note that the replicates for each
  treatment group cluster together and that the bulk of the N-glycopeptides are induced
  by RSV infection and are not observed in the RELA-depleted cells. (B) Volcano plot
  of peptides in RSV- versus mock-treated samples. X axis, fold change RSV versus
  mock; Y axis, log2 (ANOVA). Selected peptides in the integrin signaling pathway
  are labeled. (C) Volcano plot of peptides in RSV-infected cells WT versus RELA knockdown
  samples. X axis, fold change RSV versus mock; Y axis, log2 (ANOVA). Selected peptides
  in the integrin signaling pathway are labeled. (D) LFQ intensity for selected integrin
  (ITG), galectin-3 binding protein (LGALS3BP), ICAM1 and laminin subunit gamma 1
  (LAMC1) peptides. **, p < 0.01 post-hoc.
