caption: An important regulatory factor for flavanol variation. A. Differentially
  expressed structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. The first number
  in parentheses represents differentially expressed genes (upregulated in red and
  downregulated in green), and the second number is the total number of each gene.
  B. F3’5’H is a candidate gene for catechin, epicatechin, and epicatechin-3-gallate
  from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The horizontal red line indicates the
  significance threshold from 100 repetitions of the permutation test in rMVP.
article_title: Pan-transcriptome assembly combined with multiple association analysis
  provides new insights into the regulatory network of specialized metabolites in
  the tea plant Camellia sinensis.
