caption: 'Mechanisms regulating ferroptosis and the potential role in osteosarcoma.
  Three pathways initiate the process of ferroptosis: the canonical GSH-GPX4 pathway,
  iron metabolism pathway, and lipid metabolism pathway. The Potential mechanisms
  of ferroptosis in osteosarcoma are as follows: 1. Sulfasalazine, Tirapazamine, and
  Upregulating P53 or KDM4A could promote ferroptosis by directly inhibiting the activity
  of SLC7A11. Bavachin indirectly reduces SLC7A11 expression by downregulating STAT3
  to upregulate P53 expression. 2. EF24 and PEITC, upregulating Mir-1287-5p and inhibiting
  STAT3/Nrf2 signaling pathway could inhibit GPX4 to induce ferroptosis; 3. PEITC,
  Artemisinin, and Ursolic acid induce ferroptosis by increasing Fe2+ within the LIP.
  Promoting ferroptosis reduces chemotherapy resistance.'
