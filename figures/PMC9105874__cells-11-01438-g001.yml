caption: CD95 stimulation and potential links with inflammasome activation. At least
  three molecular complexes could occur upon CD95 engagement to trigger either apoptosis
  (pink circle), inflammation (green circle), or necrosis (blue circle). Apoptotic
  and necroptotic complexes control each other and the inflammatory complex (red lines).
  Necroptosis and pyroptosis signaling pathways lead to the break of the plasma membrane.
  IAPs also control an additional complex and these members are known to participate
  in the TNF-R-mediated signaling pathway. The NLRP3 inflammasome, which is activated
  by signal 1 + 2 is depicted. (GsdmD = Gasdermin D).
