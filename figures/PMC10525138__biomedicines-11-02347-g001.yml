caption: Immunolocalization of Gnas and neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H), as well
  as a representative trace of increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)
  evoked by membrane depolarization in primary cultured trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons.
  (A,B) Primary cultured TG neurons showed positive immunoreactivity to the Gnas (green
  in (A)) and NF-H, a marker of A-neuron (red in (B)). (C) These Gnas immunoreactivities
  colocalized with neurons positive for NF-H. Blue shows Nuclei. Scale bar; 50 μm.
  (D) Representative trace of transient [Ca2+]i increased response to high K+ solution
  in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The black box indicates the time period in
  which a high K+ solution was applied.
