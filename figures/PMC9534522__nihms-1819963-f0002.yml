figure_title: The PPP is upregulated in omental metastases compared with primary ovarian
  cancers
caption: Gene-expression data revealed metabolic differences of primary ovarian tumors
  and omental tumors from patients with stage III OC (n = 30).(A) Distinct clustering
  in t-SNE plot of metabolic gene data from matched primary ovarian tumors (blue)
  and omental metastases (red).(B) Volcano plot of gene-expression changes for paired
  ovarian and omental tumors highlighted genes significantly upregulated in omental
  tumors (red) and ovarian tumors (blue).(C) Pathway analysis of the significantly
  altered genes.(D) Volcano plot of metabolite abundances determined by liquid chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic analysis of matched ovarian and omental pairs (n
  = 8).(E) Pathway enrichment analysis of metabolomics data; symbol size indicates
  pathway impact and color indicates p value.(F) Changes in PPP metabolite abundances
  are plotted as outlined circles. Blue circles indicate the normalized primary tumor
  measurements for all tumor pairs (n = 8).(G) G6PD expression in ovarian and omental
  metastases (n = 8) was quantified using qPCR.(H) G6PD activity of tumor pairs (n
  = 3) was measured via enzymatic assay.(I) Tumor lysates (n = 3 pairs) were incubated
  with 25 μM DCFH-DA, and fluorescence was measured at 30 minutes.All summary bar
  graphs represent mean ± SD. Statistical significances are noted as *p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01 by two-tailed Student’s t tests.
