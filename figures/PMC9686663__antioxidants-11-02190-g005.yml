caption: Effect of bee bread on hepatic lipid metabolism-related genes, and SIRT1
  and AMPK levels. (A–D) The mRNA expression levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, CPT1α and SIRT1
  were determined by RT-qPCR assays (n = 6/group). (E,F) The levels of SIRT1 and AMPK
  were detected using ELISA (n = 8/group). Values are presented as mean ± SEM. CON,
  control; OB, obese; OB + BB, obese + bee bread 0.5 g/kg body weight/day; OB + OR,
  obese + orlistat 10 mg/kg body weight/day; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein-1c; FAS, fatty acid synthase; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
  α; CPT1α, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α; SIRT1, sirtuin 1; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase. One-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post-hoc test. ap < 0.05 vs. CON
  group, bp < 0.05 vs. OB group.
