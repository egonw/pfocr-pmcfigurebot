caption: 'ISSP attenuated oxidative damage and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway
  of EA.hy926 cells treated with ox-LDL. (a) The cell viability assessment. (b) The
  level of ET-1. (c) The level of LDH. (d) The level of SOD and MDA. (e) The western
  blot examined protein levels. (f) The expression level of Nrf2 mRNA, HO-1 mRNA,
  and NQO1 mRNA. The data are denoted as mean ± SD (a–d n = 6; e and f, n = 3). ∗P
  < 0.05indicates a significant difference compared with the control group; on the
  other hand, compared with the ox-LDL intervention group, #P < 0.05indicates that
  there is a statistically significant difference.'
