caption: Activation of mTOR signaling pathway is inhibited by RSL3 and rescued with
  ferrostatin-1 in PTC in vitro. (A) Western blot showing expression of mTOR signaling
  pathway downstream proteins; p70S6K, p-4EBP1 and p-S6 in K1 cells treated with RSL3
  or DMSO control for 6 h. (B) Western blot showing p70S6K and TfR1 expression in
  K1 cells or HThF cells treated with RSL3 (3 μM) or DMSO control for 2 and 4 h. (C)
  RSL3-mediated (3 μM) effect on mTOR pathway inhibition and induction of ferroptosis
  is abrogated by Ferrostatin-1 (5 μM) in K1 cells. (D) Western blot showing differences
  in GPX4, p70S6K, γ-H2AX, LC3BI & BII and beta-actin protein expression after GPX4
  enzyme silencing with three different shRNA vectors and non-targeting control vector,
  shNT.
