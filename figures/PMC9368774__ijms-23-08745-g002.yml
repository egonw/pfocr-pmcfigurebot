caption: 'mRNA expression of inflammatory markers and lipid mediator metabolism: mRNA
  expression was assessed for markers of inflammatory pathway activation (a–d) and
  lipid mediator metabolism enzymes (e–g). Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS, 10 µg/mL) or saline and simultaneously treated with norepinephrine (NE, 1
  µmol/L) or vehicle for 4 h. The 2-ΔΔct method was applied to present relative quantities
  as fold change of the lowest expression. Pro-inflammatory pathway-activation-marker
  inhibitor (I)κB, (a) and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3, (b) and the anti-inflammatory
  cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 (d) increased due to LPS stimulation. The rate-limiting
  enzyme for prostaglandin production, i.e., cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (e), showed an
  LPS-induced increase, whereas there were reduced epoxide hydrolase (Ephx)2 (g) mRNA
  levels in LPS-stimulated groups. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
  coactivator ((PGC)1α, (c)) and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15, (f)) mRNA expression
  were not significantly affected by LPS-stimulation or NE treatment. n = 6 per group;
  two-factorial ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test, * main effect LPS stimulation; *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
