caption: 'The NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in THP-1ROP7, but its activation
  was not directly derived from ROP7. THP-1Mock and THP-1ROP7 were induced by 1-μg/mL
  doxycycline for 48 h and differentiated under 100-nM PMA for another 48 h (A) or
  with 10-μM BAY11-7082 in THP-1ROP7. (B) Total RNA was extracted, and the mRNA relative
  fold changes were determined via RT-qPCR. (C) The 293T cells were co-transfected
  with a dual-luciferase reporter plasmid (ranilla: firefly 1:10) for NF-κB. pcDNA3-HA-ROP7
  or empty plasmids (mock). At 48 h post-transfection, luciferase activity was examined,
  and the values were normalized according to the ratio of firefly luciferase activity
  and ranilla luciferase activity. In total, 20-ng/mL TNF-α was used as a positive
  control. (D) THP-1ROP7 cells were induced by 1-μg/mL doxycycline for 48 h and differentiated
  under 100-nM PMA for another 48 h along with 10-μM Z-YVAD-FMK, Z-VAD-FMK, or MCC950.
  Total RNA was extracted, and the mRNA relative fold changes were determined via
  RT-qPCR. (E) THP-1Mock and THP-1ROP7 were induced by 1-μg/mL doxycycline for 48
  h and differentiated under 100-nM PMA for another 48 h. Then, 100-ng/mL LPS for
  4 h and 10-μM nigericin for 1 h subsequently were used to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes.
  In total, 10-μM Z-YVAD-FMK, Z-VAD-FMK, or MCC950 was added with LPS or nigericin.
  The IL-1β and TNF-α supernatant concentrations were detected by ELISA. Data are
  expressed as mean ± SEM values. ns: non-significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001, as compared with untreated groups.'
