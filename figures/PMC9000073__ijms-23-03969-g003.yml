caption: Cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP−choline) pathway for PC synthesis. Phosphatidylcholine
  or phosphocholine (PC) is formed from choline in the presence of choline kinase
  and ATP. Then, PC leads to the formation of CDP−choline with the action of choline
  phosphatase cytidyltransferase. The last step concerns the combination of both CDP−choline
  and diacylglycerides (DG) to form PC.
