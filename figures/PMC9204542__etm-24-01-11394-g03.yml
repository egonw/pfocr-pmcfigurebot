caption: PTP1B transcription is negatively regulated by KLF2. (A) A binding site of
  KLF2 on the PTP1B promoter was predicted using the JASPAR database. (B) mRNA and
  (C) protein expression of KLF2 in HUVECs with or without ox-LDL treatment were measured
  via RT-qPCR and western blotting. (D) mRNA and (E) protein expression of KLF2 in
  HUVECs transfected with or without Ov-KLF2 were detected using RT-qPCR and western
  blotting. (F) Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the binding of KLF2
  on the PTP1B promoter. (G) The binding ability of KLF2 on the PTP1B promoter was
  detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. (H) mRNA and (I) protein expression
  of PTP1B in HUVECs transfected with or without Ov-KLF2 were detected via RT-qPCR
  and western blotting. Results represent the mean Â± SD. ***P<0.001. KLF2, Kruppel-like
  factor 2; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein;
  Ov, overexpression plasmid; NC, negative control; WT, wild-type; MUT, mutant; RT-qPCR,
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; TSS, transcription start site.

  ox-LDL-induced HUVECs by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway via negative
  regulation of KLF2.
