caption: '[Ca2+]mt disorder affects early embryonic development in mice through moderating
  the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. (a, b) GSEA indicated differences of DEGs in the
  control compared to [Ca2+]mt overload or decline group enriched in the MAPK signaling
  pathway. |NES| > 1 and FDR < 0.1. (c–j) mRNA level of genes related to the ERK/MAPK
  signaling pathway in MII stage oocytes (n = 30 for each group). (k) The subcellular
  localization and expression of p-MAPK (red) in MII oocytes after different treatments.
  Scale bar, 50 μm. (l) The relative levels of p-MAPK in MII oocytes after different
  treatments: control (n = 55), spermine (n = 58), and Ru360 (n = 66). Two-tailed
  paired Student''s t-test was used for statistical analyses. Data are shown as mean
  ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
