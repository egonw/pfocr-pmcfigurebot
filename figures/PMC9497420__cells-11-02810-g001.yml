caption: 'The logic flow of knowledge based analysis (KBA) plus ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA) of Treg transcriptomics modulated in three groups of Tregs: cigarette
  smoke (SM) Tregs, morphine (M) Tregs, and cigarette smoke plus morphine (SM + M)
  Tregs includes two parts: (I) phenotypic analysis including 1176 cytokines and their
  interactors and chemokines (KBA), IPA annotated kinases and phosphatases (KBA),
  373 clusters of differentiation (CDs), cellâ€“cell interaction signaling pathways
  (KBA), 61 regulators of seven CD4+ T cell subsets including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17,
  Tregs, Tfh, and Th22 (KBA); (II) molecular mechanisms including 266 immunometabolism
  genes (KBA), 101 trained immunity genes (KBA), and 164 histone modification enzymes
  (epigenetic regulators, KBA), IPA annotated transcription factors in Treg and inducible
  Treg TFs, and loss of function approach to determine 304 transcription factor expressions
  in 31 transcriptomic datasets (including 17 gene knockouts).'
