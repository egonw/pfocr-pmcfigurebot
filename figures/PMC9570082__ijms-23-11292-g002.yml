caption: Intrathecal AAV-CM recruits myeloid cells to the healthy CNS. (A) Flow cytometric
  gating strategy to distinguish CD45high leukocytes from CD45dim microglia, and CD11bhigh,
  macrophages/monocytes (CD45hiCD11bhiGR1low/-F4/80+), and granulocytes (CD45hiCD11bhiGR1hiF4/80-).
  The proportion of CD45high, CD11bhigh, monocytes and granulocytes were significantly
  increased in the CNS tissues of mice upon intrathecal AAV-CM treatment (n = 4–6
  per group). (B) RT-qPCR analysis of brains showed CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL10 and IL-10
  significantly induced upon intrathecal AAV-CM treatment at 1 day post dose (n =
  4–6). control (ctrl). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. The results were analyzed
  using the two-tailed Mann–Whitney u-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
