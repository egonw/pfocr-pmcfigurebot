caption: Overview of cSCC and BCC development and progression from keratinocytes.
  This figure illustrates the sequential stages of melanoma development and progression.
  Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal-cell carcinomas (BCCs) stem from
  keratinocytes, the principal cells of the skin. Aberrant keratinocyte growth initiates
  these skin cancers. Within the skin, basal cells can differentiate into squamous
  cells or remain in the basal layer, dividing as basal cells. Like melanomas, cSCC
  and BCCs consist of four stages based on the TNM staging system. cSCC’s progression
  commences with normal keratinocytes, advancing through premalignant stages like
  actinic keratosis and Bowen’s disease. Specific gene mutations drive this process.
  Factors like UV light exposure, immune-related concerns including immunosuppression
  and other environmental influences cause genomic and proteomic changes, enabling
  tumor invasion and metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs. Notably, less than
  0.6% of actinic keratosis cases may progress to cSCC, with approximately 70% of
  cSCCs originating from actinic keratosis []. For BCCs, a similar TNM staging applies,
  yet a premalignant lesion is yet to be identified. Mutations in Hedgehog and non-Hedgehog
  pathway genes, the immune microenvironment, sun exposure and other factors significantly
  contribute to BCC development and progression, constructing the intricate molecular
  landscape of these skin malignancies. × indicates inactivation or disruption of
  the immune system.
