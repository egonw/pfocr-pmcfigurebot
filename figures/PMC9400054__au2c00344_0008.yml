caption: 'Design tools and strategies for the construction of microbial cell factories.
  (A) Molecular tools for the introduction of biosynthetic pathways to host cells.
  (B) Engineering enzymes using rational design, directed evolution and computational
  de novo design approaches. (C) Substrate channeling strategies toward product formation.
  (D) Genome-scale metabolic models driven by omics data and artificial intelligence.
  (E) Chassis random mutagenesis using ARTP and genome shuffling methods. (F) Increasing
  tolerance to target chemicals using ALE and process engineering. (G) Transporter
  engineering for the export and import of metabolites. (H) Engineering storage capacities
  for metabolites and energy. (I) Increasing membrane area by morphology engineering.
  (J) Antibiotics-free systems. The abbreviations are as follows: AI, artificial intelligence;
  ALE, adaptive laboratory evolution; ARTP, atmospheric and room-temperature plasma;
  FAs, fatty acids; IMV, inner membrane vesicles; OMV, outer membrane vesicles; PHB,
  polyhydroxybutyrate; RBS, ribosome binding site; TAGs, triacylglycerols; β-OX, β-oxidation
  pathway.'
