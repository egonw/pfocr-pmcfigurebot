caption: Alterations of transcriptomic gene expression in the stroke-induced hippocampus.
  (A) A total of 714 DEGs was upregulated and 218 downregulated after induction of
  transient ischemia (TI) using RNA sequencing (Log 2 FC); (B) In comparison, 245
  DEGs were downregulated while 521 were upregulated in the TI-induced stroke + OLNZ
  treatment group; (C) DEGs separated (MA plot) in 1-fold change (FC) compared with
  the sham-TI induced group; (D) TI induced stroke + OLNZ treatment group; and (E,F)
  A volcano plot of DEGs.
