figure_title: Change in pathway activity over time in response to ONC201/TIC10
caption: Scatter plots displaying the enrichment scores (Y-axis) of (A) REACTOME cell
  cycle signature, (B) REACTOME ATF4 activated genes in response to endoplasmic reticulum
  stress signature, (C) REACTOME unfolded protein response UPR signature, (D) BIOCARTA
  ERK pathway signature, and (E) BIOCARTA AKT pathway signature over time (X-axis).
  The solid lines and shaded area indicate linear fit and 95% confidence intervals,
  respectively, with p-value of the fit indicated above each plot. The analysis includes
  data from six replicates at time 0 hr, and three replicates each at time 3, 6, 12,
  and 24 hr for a total n = 18.
