caption: Visualization of joint pathway enrichment analyses. Graph that resulted from
  the joint pathway enrichment analysis using MetaboAnalyst of the proteins and metabolites
  that altered significantly (p value < 0.05) in resistant Hep3B cells vs. parental
  Hep3Bcells. Nodes are colored according to p value. Significant pathways are colored
  red, while non-significant pathways are colored yellow to white. Nodes are sized
  according to the number of associated members proteins and/or metabolites.
