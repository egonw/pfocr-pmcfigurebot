caption: miR-98-5p expression is upregulated during HG-induced preosteoblastic differentiation.
  The expression levels of (A) miR-98-5p, and differentiation-regulated genes (B)
  OCN and (C) OPN in the differentiation process of MC3T3-E1 cells after HG induction.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ***P<0.001. Induced 7-day, incubation in a
  DM for 7 days; induced 14-day, incubation in a DM for 14 days; OCN, osteocalcin;
  OPN, osteopontin; DM, differentiation medium; HG, high glucose.
article_title: Inhibition of miR-98-5p promotes high glucose-induced suppression of
  preosteoblast proliferation and differentiation via the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β
  signaling pathway by targeting BMP2.
