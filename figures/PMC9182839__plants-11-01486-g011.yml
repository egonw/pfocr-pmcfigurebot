caption: 'Effect of Damiana leaves extract on protein expression Nrf2, DLD, HO-1,
  and NQO-1 signaling pathway on UVB-irradiated HaCaT (A,B) and HDF (C,D) cells. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. # and * indicate significant differences from the
  non-irradiated control and UVB-treated groups, respectively. # and ##p < 0.05 and
  0.01 vs. the non-treated group. *, ** and *** p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 vs. the
  UVB-treated control, respectively.'
