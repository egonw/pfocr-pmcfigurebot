caption: 9r inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis. (A,B) Pretreatment with 9r significantly
  reduced the apoptosis rate of H2O2-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Flow cytometry was used
  immediately for the treated cells. Data are shown as the mean standard deviation
  of three independent experiments compared to the described control group, *** p
  < 0.001. Compared to the H2O2âˆ’treated group, &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01.
