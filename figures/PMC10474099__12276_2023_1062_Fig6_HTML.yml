figure_title: The enhancing effect of SLC39A10 on the protein stability of CK2β and
  the holoenzyme activity of CK2
caption: a The effect of SLC39A10 knockdown on the holoenzyme activity of CK2 was
  evaluated by western blotting analysis (first two panels). In addition, SLC39A10-overexpressing
  AGS and MKN45 cells and control cells were treated with 3.5 μM TPEN, 5 μM silmitasertib
  (CX-4945, a selective CK2 inhibitor) or vehicle for 24 h, and the holoenzyme activity
  of CK2 was then quantified by western blotting analysis (the last four panels).
  β-Actin was used as a loading control. b SLC39A10-overexpressing AGS and MKN45 cells
  were treated with 5 μM CX-4945 for 24 h, and western blotting analysis was then
  performed to test the effect of CX-4945 treatment on MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway
  activity. β-Actin was used as a loading control. c An MTT assay was carried out
  to evaluate cell proliferation in SLC39A10-overexpressing AGS and MKN45 cells and
  control cells with the indicated treatments. d The effect of SLC39A10 knockdown
  or overexpression on the protein expression of CK2α and CK2β was evaluated by western
  blotting analysis. β-Actin was used as a loading control. e SLC39A10-knockdown AGS
  and MKN45 cells and control cells were treated with 10 µM CHX for the indicated
  times, and CK2β protein expression was then evaluated by western blotting analysis
  (left panels). The band intensity of CK2β was normalized to that of β-Actin, and
  this value was then normalized to the corresponding value in the control cells (right
  panel). f The indicated cells were treated with 25 μM MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor)
  for 3 h, and the protein expression of SLC39A10 and CK2β was evaluated by western
  blotting analysis. β-Actin was used as a loading control. Data are presented as
  the means ± SDs. ***P < 0.001.
