caption: 'Quantification of Nrf2 and two of its effectors, HO-1 and NQO1, in the C3–C6
  spinal cord following C2 hemi-section. (A) Representative blot and associated quantification
  of Nrf2 expression in the C3–C6 spinal cord, 1 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d post-injury
  (P.I.). ** Compared to uninjured and 1 h, 1 d, and 7 d P.I. corresponding sides,
  p < 0.05. *** 3 d P.I. intact side compared to 3 d P.I. injured side, p < 0.001.
  † Uninjured compared to 1 h P.I. injured side, p < 0.05. # Compared to 1 h and 7
  d P.I. corresponding side, p < 0.05. (B) Representative blot and associated quantification
  of HO-1 expression in the C3–C6 spinal cord, 1 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d post-injury
  (P.I.). *** Compared to uninjured and 1 h, 1 d, and 7 d P.I. corresponding sides,
  p < 0.001. ## Compared to 1 h and 1 d P.I. corresponding side, p < 0.01. † Uninjured
  compared to 1 d P.I. injured side, p = 0.039. (C) Representative blot and associated
  quantification of NQO1 expression in the C3–C6 spinal cord, 1 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 7
  d post-injury (P.I.). *** Compared to uninjured and 1 h, 1 d, and 7 d P.I. corresponding
  sides, p < 0.001. ### 3 d P.I. intact side compared to 7 d P.I. intact side, p <
