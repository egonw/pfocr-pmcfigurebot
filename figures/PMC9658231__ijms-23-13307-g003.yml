caption: 'SIRT4 inhibited mitochondrial division and promoted its fusion induced by
  heat stress. (A–D) The mRNA levels of MFN1, MFN2, OPA1, and DRP1 in BMECs were determined
  by RT-qPCR after expression SIRT4 under heat stress treatment. (E–I) The protein
  levels of MFN1, MFN2, p-DRP1, DRP1, and FIS1 were examined in BMECs after expression
  of SIRT4 under heat stress treatment by Western blotting. NC: negative control;
  Mock: expression of control vector. These results are presented as the mean ± SEM
  from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
