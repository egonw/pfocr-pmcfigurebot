caption: . Western blot analysis of estrogen membrane receptor (GPER) signaling pathway
  proteins. (a, b) Western blot result of proteins related to GPER/EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway
  of SKOV3 cells treated with 5 and 10 μM SK for 24 h. (c, d) Western blot results
  for proteins related to the GPER/EGFR/PI3K/ AKT pathway in A2780 cells treated with
  0.5 and 1.0 μM SK for 24 h. The results are means of three independent replicates ± S.D.∗P
  < 0.05 or ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. control group were considered as statistically significantly.
