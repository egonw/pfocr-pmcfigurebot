caption: Energies and zero-point-corrected free energies (in parentheses) of possible
  steps on the [1]2–-catalyzed reduction pathway of H2C=O with HBpin. All calculations
  were performed at the wB97XD, def2-TZVP level. All energies are given in kcal/mol.
  The energies in each of the six triangles sum to the overall energy of CH2O + H–[B]
  → HCH2O–[B], and each therefore constitutes a viable catalytic cycle. Based on the
  experimental evidence supporting the presence of I2 and I4, we favor the cycle highlighted
  with bold arrows as the dominant one (see text for more detailed discussion).
