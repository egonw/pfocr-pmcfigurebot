figure_title: The endogenous sAC agonist bicarbonate induces YAP S397 phosphorylation
  in melanoma
caption: '(A) Left panel, representative western blots showing YAP S397 phosphorylation
  in mouse melanoma lines in response to 10 μM IBMX with or without bicarbonate ion
  (HCO3−), an agonist of sAC, for 30 min. Right panel, quantification of P-397 band
  volumes normalized to total YAP band intensity expressed as the fold change of bicarbonate
  + IBMX (+,+) relative to IBMX alone (−,+). n ≥ 3 biological replicates. Student’s
  t test.(B) Microscopy images of endogenous sAC localization in human melanoma cell
  lines. Scale bar: 10 μm.(C) Left panel, representative western blots showing YAP
  S397 phosphorylation in human melanoma lines incubated in control media or in the
  presence of 50 μM IBMX with or without bicarbonate ion (HCO3−), an agonist of endogenous
  sAC, for 30 min. Right panel, quantification of P-397 band volumes normalized to
  total YAP band intensity expressed as the fold change of bicarbonate + IBMX (+,+)
  relative to IBMX alone (−,+). n ≥ 3 biological replicates. Student’s t test.(D)
