caption: 'The effect of three inhibitors on PD-induced the human washed platelets
  aggregation. (a) The aggregation rate of PD alone or combined with VP, TG, or ST
  on human platelets. (b) VP inhibited the aggregation rate of platelets treated with
  the different concentrations of PD (140 μM). (c) The different concentrations of
  VP inhibited the aggregation rate of platelets treated with PD. (d) VP at different
  preincubation times inhibited the aggregation rate of platelets treated with PD
  (140 μM). (e) VP inhibited the ATP release of platelets treated with PD (140 μM).
  (f) VP inhibited the CD62P expression rate of platelets treated with PD (140 μM).
  (g) VP inhibited the PAC-1 binding rate of platelets treated with PD (140 μM). (h)
  VP inhibited the [Ca2+]i of platelets treated with PD. (i) PD promoted the PAR1
  expression of the human platelet. Vorapaxar: VP; ticagrelor: TG; seratrodast: ST.
  The data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared
  to the PD group; ###p < 0.001 compared to the thrombin group; &&p < 0.01 and &&&p
  < 0.001 compared to the vehicle group. VP: vorapaxar; TG: ticagrelor; ST: seratrodast.'
