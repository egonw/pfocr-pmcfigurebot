caption: From whole chromosome mis-segregation to segmental alterations. (A) Lagging
  chromosomes may be incorporate into micronuclei, encountering chromothripsis (a
  phenomenon of massive chromatin fragmentation) during the following cell replication
  cycle. These severe rearranged chromosomes can be subsequently included back in
  the main nucleus. (B) Missegregated chromosomes can be frequently damaged during
  cytokinesis activating DNA double-strand break response leading to new segmental
  alterations. (C) Chromatin bridges can cause chromatin breakage triggering breakage-fusion-bridge
  cycle, a well described origin of segmental alterations.
