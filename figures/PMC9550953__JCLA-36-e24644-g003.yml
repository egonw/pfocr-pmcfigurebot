caption: CircPPP1R12A promoted the proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells by encoding
  a small peptide. (A) The pattern diagram of 1138‐nt circPPP1R12A and a 73‐aa (~10 kDa)
  protein (circPPP1R12A‐73aa) was shown. (B and C) A CMV‐induced expression vector
  contained the HA‐labeled circPPP1R12A sequence (Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A). Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A
  with start codon mutant (ATG/ACG) (Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐Mut). A CMV‐induced expression
  vector contained the HA‐labeled circPPP1R12A‐73aa sequence (Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐73aa).
  The pattern diagram of these vectors was shown. (D) CircPPP1R12A expression was
  confirmed in A549 and H1299 cells after Lv‐HA‐control, Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A, Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐Mut
  and Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐73aa transfection. (E) CCK‐8 assay was used to detect the
  cell viability of A549 and H1299 cells after Lv‐HA‐control, Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A,
  Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐Mut and Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐73aa transfection. (F) Western blotting
  was used to detect circPPP1R12A‐73aa peptide after Lv‐HA‐control, Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A,
  Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐Mut and Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐73aa transfection. (G and H) The quantitative
  analysis of HA protein expression in A549 and H1299 cells. (I) Transwell assay was
  used to determine A549 and H1299 cell invasion after Lv‐HA‐control, Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A,
  Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐Mut and Lv‐HA‐circPPP1R12A‐73aa transfection.
