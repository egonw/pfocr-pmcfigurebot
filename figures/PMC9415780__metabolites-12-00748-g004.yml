caption: Effects of COX4 isoform expression on fatty acid pathway metabolites in glioma
  cells. Boxplots depict the levels of key metabolites involved in fatty acid metabolism
  analyzed in COX4-1- and COX4-2-overexpressing cells. The horizontal line inside
  the box indicates the median value. Results of five independent measurements. *,
  p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ****, p < 0.0001; a.u., arbitrary units; ns, not significant;
  EFA, essential fatty acids; SFA, saturated fatty acids; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty
  acids. (Right) Schematic representation of fatty acid metabolism.
