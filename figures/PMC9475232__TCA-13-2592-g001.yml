caption: 'Fibulin‐4 promotes invasion and migration but inhibits apoptosis in esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. (a) Eca109 or KYSE30 cells that migrated or
  invaded across the membrane were fixed and stained. (b) Cells that passed through
  the membrane were counted in three random fields. (c) Eca109 and KYSE30 cells treated
  or left untreated were analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of PE‐ and/or
  7‐AAD‐positive cells is included in the panels. (d) The results are expressed as
  the percentages (mean standard deviation [SD] of three repeated experiments) of
  apoptotic/necrotic cells. The error bars indicate the means ± SD averaged from three
  independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. NC:
  Negative control of silencing lentiviral vector; vector: Negative control of overexpression
  lentiviral vector.'

  of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells to apatinib by activating the Akt‐mTOR
