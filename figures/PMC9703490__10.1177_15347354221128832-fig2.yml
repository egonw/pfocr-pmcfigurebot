caption: The activity of MMPs in A549, HeLa, and U2OS cells treated with EELDP for
  24 hours. (A, C, and E) represent the typical gel pictures of zymograms of A549,
  HeLa, and U2OS respectively. M-Marker, 0.0-control, 0.1-0.1 mg/ml, 0.3-0.3 mg/ml,
  0.6-0.6 mg/ml concentration of EELDP. (B, D, and F) are the bar diagram of the mean ± standard
  deviation of MMPs activity obtained from 3 sets of experiments at different concentrations
  of EELDP in A549, HeLa, and U2OS cells respectively. Here “**” defines 0.001 < P ≤ 0.01
  and “***” defines P ≤ 0.001.
