caption: 'Glucose uptake (left graph) and lactate production (right graph) by MDA-MB-231
  cells treated with Viscum album summer mother tinctures for 48 h (black bars) and
  72 h (grey bars) of the treatment with A-S (1.0% and 2.0% v/v) and Q-S (0.5% and
  1% v/v). Plotted values are relative to the control (ethanol vehicle) at the same
  concentration of the summer mother tinctures, *p < 0.05 calculated by nonparametric
  Mann-Whitney test. Legend symbols: V. album subsp. abietis growing on Abies alba
  in summer (A–S); V. album subsp. album growing on Quercus petraea in summer (Q–S).'
