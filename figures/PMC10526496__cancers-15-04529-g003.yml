caption: DPP-4 inhibition-induced autophagy is dependent on the mTOR/HIF-1α axis.
  (A). Western blot analysis of p-mTOR, HIF-1α, LC3, and p62 in MCF 10A, MCF7, and
  MDA-MB-231 cells treated with KR62436 (KR, 50 μM) and/or rapamycin (Rapa, 1 μM)
  for 48 h. Densitometric analysis of protein levels relative to β-actin or LC3I levels
  (n = 3 per group). (B). The levels of HIF-1α, LC3, and p62 were estimated by Western
  blot assays. MCF 10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with KR (50 μM), HIF-1α
  siRNA (100 nM), or KR and HIF-1α siRNA for 48 h. Densitometric analysis of protein
  levels relative to β-actin or LC3I levels (n = 3 per group). The data in the graph
  are presented as the mean ± SEM. NS, not significant.
