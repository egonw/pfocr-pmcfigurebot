caption: 'In vivo micro–computed tomography (CT) images and analysis of the subchondral
  bone resorption at the mandibular condyle induced by overloaded functional orthopedic
  force. A: Sagittal micro-CT image of condyle. B: micro-CT measurements for the indicated
  parameters in the subchondral bone. Bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness
  (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), and trabecular number (Tb.N) were calculated
  from subchondral cubes. The data were expressed as mean ± SD and ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
article_title: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in the progress of mandibular
  condylar cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss induced by overloaded
  functional orthopedic force (OFOF).
