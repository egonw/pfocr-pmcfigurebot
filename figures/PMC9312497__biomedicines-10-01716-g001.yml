caption: Activation of NF-κB in severe asthmatic fibroblasts. NHBF and DHBF were cultured
  in DMEM complete medium post serum-starvation. (A) Under basal conditions, mRNA
  expression of NF-κB pathway members, TLR4, BCL10, MALT1, CARMA3, IκBα, A20, RELA,
  IL-6 and IL-8, in NHBF and DHBF was analyzed by qRT-PCR and expressed as fold expression
  change relative to NHBF post normalization to housekeeping gene 18s rRNA. (B) Whole
  cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis of Bcl10 protein levels. β-actin
  was used as loading control. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from at least 3
  unique donors in each group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 determined by
  unpaired two-tailed Student t-test.
