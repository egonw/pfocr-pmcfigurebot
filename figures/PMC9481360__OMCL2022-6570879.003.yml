caption: 'IPO5 enrichment analysis diagram based on GSEA. GSEA presented both group''s
  expression was mainly enriched in (a) basic transcription factors, (b) cell cycle,
  (c) RNA degradation, (d) small cell lung cancer, (e) oxidative phosphorylation,
  (f) Parkinson''s disease, (g) phenylalanine metabolism, and (h) arachidonic acid
  metabolism, in 8 pathways. NES: normalized enrichment score; ES: concentration score;
  FDR: error detection rate.'
