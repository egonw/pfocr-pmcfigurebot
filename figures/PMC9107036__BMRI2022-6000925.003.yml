caption: KIF22 plays a vital role in the regulation of the pancreatic cancer cell
  cycle. (a) KIF22 is highly enriched in the cell cycle pathway in pancreatic cancer
  analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). (b, c) The level of KIF22 expression
  was found to be positively correlated with the positive ratio of Ki67 cells. (d)
  Silencing KIF22 causes the significant upregulation of G1 and S phase populations
  in PANC-1 and MIA-PaCa-2, as well as downregulation of G2 and M phase populations.
