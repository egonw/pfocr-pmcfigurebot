caption: The signaling pathway of miR29B-mediated apoptosis involves the degradation
  of EZH2 and the inhibition of BTK. Ibrutinib effectively inhibits and inactivates
  BTK, a critical component of the B-cell receptor signaling (BCR) pathway. On the
  other hand, MS1943 acts as a potent EZH2 degrader. Simultaneous induction of these
  reactions leads to the upregulation of miR29B, which in turn activates the downstream
  pathway involving TP53. The increased levels of TP53 promote the expression of PUMA,
  a pro-apoptotic protein, ultimately leading to cell death. The activation of PUMA
  induces mitochondrial dysfunction through a series of intricate processes. Subsequently,
  caspase-3 is activated and cleaved, triggering the cleavage of PARP within the cell
  nucleus. This cascade of events ultimately culminates in apoptosis. It is worth
  noting that XIAP, an anti-apoptotic protein, inhibits the activity of cleaved caspase-3.
