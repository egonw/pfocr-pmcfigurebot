caption: Representative LC-MS/MS chromatograms of sterol standards (A) and extracted
  sterols from Leishmaniadonovani LV82 promastigote parasites treated with the vehicle
  (B), posaconazole (C), or fluconazole (D). Corresponding MRM transitions and retention
  times can be found in . LV82 promastigotes were treated with 0.4% DMSO vehicle,
  20 μM PSZ, or 50 μM FLU. Arrows indicate the LC retention time of corresponding
  sterol standards.
article_title: Sterol profiling of Leishmania parasites using a new HPLC-tandem mass
  spectrometry-based method and antifungal azoles as chemical probes reveals a key
  intermediate sterol that supports a branched ergosterol biosynthetic pathway.
