caption: Comparison of the expression levels of P-gp, glycans, and mRNA for the glycosyltransferases
  between K562 and K562/ADR cells.A, the expression levels of P-gp were analyzed by
  immunoblotting with an anti-P-gp antibody; α-tubulin served as a loading control.
  B–F, equal amounts of the cell lysates of K562 and K562/ADR cells were stained with
  E4-PHA, ConA, SNA, DSA, and L4-PHA lectin, respectively. α-tubulin was used as a
  loading control. G, the expression levels of bisecting GlcNAc on the cell surface
  were analyzed by flow cytometry using E4-PHA. H, the mRNA levels of several N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases,
  which are involved in GlcNAc branched N-glycan synthesis, were detected via RT-PCR;
  GAPDH was used as an internal control. The data were obtained from three independent
  experiments. All values are reported as the mean ± S.E.M (n = 3). ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  n.s, no significance by two-way analysis of variance. ADR, adriamycin-resistant;
  P-gp, P-glycoprotein.
