caption: The free PM shows potent suppression activity on Ph +cell lines. (A) LAMA84 cells
  were cultured in presence of 20 nM free PM for indicated time, then cells were harvested
  for westren blotting analysis using Ac-TUBULIN,TUBULIN, Ac-H3, and H3 antibodies.
  GAPDH served total protein loading control. (B) LAMA84 and K562 cells were transfected
  with the mCherry-luciferase-puromycin virus to generate stable cell lines, and luciferase-tagged
  cells were cultured in presence of DMSO or the indicated concentration of free PM.
  Luminescence activity was measured every 12 h. Relative cell vitality was normalized
  with cells treated with DMSO. (C) BCR-ABL(T315I) or MIG transducted BaF3 cells were
  treated with indicated concentration of free PM. Cell apoptosis was measured with
  Annexin-V/PI staining and analyzed with FACS. (D) LAMA84 and K562 cells were cultured
  in presence of DMSO or free PM at the indicated concentrations for 24 h, the harvested
  cells were digested with RNAase and stained with PI for cell cycle analysis. (E)
  LAMA84 and K562 cells were cultured with DMSO or the free PM at the indicated concentrations
  for 36 h. Cell apoptosis was measured with Annexin-V/PI staining and analyzed with
  FACS. (F) LAMA84 cells were treated with 20 nM free PM for the indicated time, and
  western blotting analysis were performed to detect endogenous and exogenous apoptotic
  proteins including CASPASE9, CASPASE8, CASPASE3, PARP and their associate proteins
  P53, BCL-XL and BAD; (G) and proteins involved in cell proliferation pathway including
  c-RAF, p-c-RAF, MEK, p-MEK, ERK, p-ERK, AKT, p-AKT; and (H) BCR-ABL, c-MYC, ALOX5,
  ALOX15, β-CATENIN, EZH2, p-STAT5, STAT5, p-FAK, and FAK. GAPDH served as total protein
  loading control.
