caption: Differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis in TPX2high COAD.
  a Heat map clustering of 512 COAD transcripts stratified into high vs low according
  to median TPX2 expression. b GO enrichment tree in the TPX2high vs TPX2low COAD.
  Enrichment p value is indicated for each functional category. c Bubble chart illustrating
  activated (orange) and suppressed (blue) canonical pathways in TPX2high vs TPX2low
  COAD employing IPA analysis. Size of the bubble corresponds to the number of genes
  that overlap the pathway. X-axis represents the -log p-value
