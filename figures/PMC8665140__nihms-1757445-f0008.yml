figure_title: The relative expression of iron-regulated genes is altered in vps3Δ,
  vam6Δ and rim101Δ mutants
caption: (A-E) Analysis of transcript levels of target genes in Rim101 pathway (CIG1,
  PHO89 and SIT1) as well as the genes for high affinity transport (CFO1 and CFT1)
  in response to iron availability in the WT strain, and representative vps3Δ, vam6Δ
  and rim101Δ mutants by RT- qPCR. The data were from three biological replicates,
  the analyses were performed twice, and each gene was normalized to WT in 10 μM FeCl3.
  * indicates significance at P<0.05, and ** at P<0.01.
