caption: 'AVA-NP-695 significantly induces IFN response in various in vitro cell studies.
  (A) Effect of AVA-NP-695 on IFN-β mRNA level. THP1 DualTM cells were treated with
  different AVA-NP-695 concentrations and 25 µM of 2′3′-cGAMP for 24 h and RNA was
  isolated. IFN-β fold change was plotted; data were normalized using GAPDH. AVA-NP-695
  was added 2 h prior to 2′3′-cGAMP addition (n = 3). (B,C) Three million PBMCs were
  seeded in a 12-well plate. AVA-NP-695 was added to the respective wells at various
  concentrations. The plate was incubated for 2 h prior to addition of 2′3′-cGAMP
  (25 µM). The plate was further incubated for 24 h. RNA was isolated after the incubation,
  followed by RT-PCR for IFN-β (B) and CXCL-10 (C) mRNA quantification. GAPDH was
  used as endogenous control (n = 2). (D) Schematic representation of functional effect
  of ENPP1 inhibition on IFN induction in (E) A549 DualTM and (F) THP1 DualTM cells.
  After the in vitro enzymatic reaction, 10 µL of the reaction mixture was diluted
  by adding 120 µL of complete RPMI. This diluted mix was used to treat the cells
  for 24 h. IFN induction was estimated by a luciferase reporter assay under the control
  of IFN-stimulated response elements. For all the experiments, control groups were
  considered to be 1 and the p-values were calculated with respect to the control
  group using ordinary one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s test. For
  comparison between two internal groups, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed.
