caption: 'Time of thermal stimulation response(s). There was no difference in time
  of thermal stimulation response in three groups at 7 days. PMSC treatment significantly
  improved thermal stimulus response at 14 and 28 days compared with the control group.
  LGK974 inhibitor significantly decreased the therapeutic effect of PMSCs. âˆ—PMSC
  group vs. the control group, P < 0.05; #PMSC group vs. PMSC+LGK974 group, P < 0.05
  (a). No significant difference between control group and LGK974 group at 7, 14,
  and 28 days (b).'
