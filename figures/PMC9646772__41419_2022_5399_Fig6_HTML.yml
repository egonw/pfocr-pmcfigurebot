figure_title: SLC1A5_var inhibited LPS-induced astrocytic inflammatory cytokines and
  down-regulates TLR4 signal pathway
caption: 'Astrocytes were transfected with SLC1A5_var (OE) or with SLC1A5_var siRNA
  for 48 h and stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 h. The mRNA expression levels
  of Tnf-α (A), Il-6 (B), Il-1β (C), and Il-18 (D) stimulated with LPS were detected
  by qRT-qPCR(n = 3). Secretion of TNF-α (E), IL-6 (F), IL-1β (G) and IL-18 (H) in
  astrocytes stimulated with LPS was detected by ELISA (n = 3). The protein level
  of TLR4, p-p38, p-JNK and p-AKT was determined by western blot (C, F) while SLC1A5_var
  was overexpression (I) or knockdown (N) and quantified by densitometry (J–M and
  O–R) (n = 3). Data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs control,
  ns, P > 0.05, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001 vs LPS group, two-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.'
