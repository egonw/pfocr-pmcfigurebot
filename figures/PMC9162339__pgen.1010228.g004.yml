figure_title: Expressing dNGLY1 in dopamine and/or serotonin neurons rescues lethality
  in dNGLY1pl/pl flies
caption: The GAL4/UAS system was used to express dNGLY1 in a cell-type specific pattern
  in otherwise dNGLY1pl/pl flies. Expressing dNGLY1 in the endogenous expression pattern
  with dNGLY1ΔGAL4 completely rescued the lethality phenotype of dNGLY1ΔGAL4/pl flies.
  Expressing dNGLY1 only in dopamine and serotonin neurons with Ddc-GAL4 rescued to
  47.5%. Expressing dNGLY1 in only serotonin neurons with Trh-GAL4 rescued to 13.8%,
  and expression in only dopamine neurons with TH-GAL4 did not rescue lethality.
article_title: An in vivo drug repurposing screen and transcriptional analyses reveals
  the serotonin pathway and GSK3 as major therapeutic targets for NGLY1 deficiency.
