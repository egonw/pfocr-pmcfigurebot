caption: Top significantly affected canonical pathways in the retina. Chart depicts
  the significantly (p < 0.05) enriched canonical pathways implicated in the retina,
  which were determined by p-value overlap between the proteins identified in our
  datasets and the molecules in the respective pathways, according to (a) âˆ’log10 (p-value)
  and (b) activation z-score. Blue indicates negative and orange indicates positive
  regulation based on the activation z-scores for canonical pathway comparison between
  the different groups and treatment paradigms.
