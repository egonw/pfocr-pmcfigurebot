caption: Gene expression changes in the Drosophila gut in Sen, OKSM and combination
  treatment. (A) Heatmap of gene expression in ubiquitous expression experiments with
  armGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-TdTomato (WT), armGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-OKSM (OKSM),
  armGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-Sen (Sen) and armGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-Sen; UAS-OKSM
  (OKSM-Sen) dissected midguts showing seven clusters with differing expression patterns
  across the four conditions. (B) Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway Enrichment analysis
  of ubiquitous expression highlighting key signaling and metabolic pathways associated
  with the individual clusters (FDR < 10%). (C) Heatmap of gene expression changes
  in stem cell only expression experiments with esgGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-TdTomato
  (WT), esgGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-OKSM (OKSM), esgGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-Sen (Sen)
  and esgGal4; tubGal80ts > UAS-Sen; UAS-OKSM (OKSM-Sen) dissected midguts again showing
  seven clusters with differing expression patterns across the four conditions. (D)
  Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway Enrichment analysis of ISC only highlighting key
  signaling and metabolic pathways associated with the individual clusters (FDR <
  10%). (E) Venn diagram showing overlap in genes from ubiquitous and ISC-restricted
  expression. (F) Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway Enrichment analysis of the major
  pathways affected in both models.
