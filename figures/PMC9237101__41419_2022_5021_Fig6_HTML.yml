figure_title: The role of the IDO1-MDM2-p53 signaling pathway in DLBCL cells
caption: A GSEA showed DEGs enriched in the p53 pathway in IDO1 inhibition OCI-Ly10
  cells. B The molecular functional network of IDO1-MDM2-p53 was constructed using
  GeneMANIA (http://genemania.org/). C-D OCI-Ly3 and OCI-Ly10 cells were treated with
  5 mM 1-L-MT for 24 h. The expression levels of MDM2 and p53 were detected using
  WB. E, F OCI-Ly3 and OCI-Ly10 cells were treated with RG7388 for 24 h. The expression
  levels of IDO1, MDM2, and p53 were assessed using WB. G, H Proteins related to apoptosis,
  including the proapoptotic proteins BAX and PUMA and the antiapoptotic proteins
  BCL-2 and BCL-XL, were assessed by WB. I GSEA showed DEGs enriched in apoptosis
  in OCI-Ly10 cells treated with 1-L-MT. J, K The protein levels of cell cycle markers,
  including p21 and p53, were assessed by WB. The results showed increased expression
  of p21 coupled with elevated p53 levels in OCI-Ly3 (J) and OCI-Ly10 (K) cells. L
  Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the increased levels of p53 in OCI-Ly3 cells
  after 24 h of treatment with 1-L-MT. M–O The expression of BAX (M), PUMA (N), and
  P21 (O) was assessed by RT-qPCR in OCI-Ly3 and OCI-Ly10 after treatment with 1-L-MT
  for 24 h. Statistical analysis was analyzed with a two-sided student’s t-test. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
