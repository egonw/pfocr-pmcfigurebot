caption: ISP-I induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in H460 and A549. (A) NSCLC cells
  were exposed to increasing doses of ISP-I for 48h, and apoptosis was evaluated by
  flow cytometry analysis after Annexin V and PI double staining. (B) Bax, Bcl-2,
  Puma and cleaved Caspase 3/ 8/ 9 expression levels were evaluated when H460 and
  A549 were treated with ISP-I at 0, 5, 10 and 15 Î¼M for 48h. (C) Cell cycle analysis
  after treatment for 48 h with increasing dosages of ISP-I. (D) Protein levels of
  p21, phospho-cdc2, cdc2 and cyclin B1 were investigated after treatment with increasing
  doses of ISP-I for 48 h by western blotting. ns p > 0.05, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  and *** p < 0.001.
