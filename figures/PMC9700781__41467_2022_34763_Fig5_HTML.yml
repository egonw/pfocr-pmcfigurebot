figure_title: Mitochondrial capacity is reduced in Rptor-deficient lungs
caption: 'a Heatmap of gene expression of the glycolytic and related pathways from
  control and Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+ lungs at 11.5 days post coitus (dpc). The genes with
  significantly altered expression in the absence of Rptor were: Ldha (1), Aldoa (2),
  Pgk1 (3), Pfkl (Pfkm) (4), Tpi1 (5), Hk2 (6) and Pklr (7). The expression of these
  seven genes was decreased in Rptor-deficient lungs. b, c Gene Ontology (GO) pathway
  analysis of bulk RNA-Seq of control and Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+ lungs at 11.5 dpc. d
  Quantification of the relative ratio of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to nuclear DNA
  (nDNA) in purified lung epithelial cells derived from control and Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+
  mice at 13.5 dpc (n = 4 for each group). 16S rRNA and mtND1 represent the mitochondrial
  genes while Hk2 (hexokinase 2) represents the nuclear genes. e Quantification of
  the relative ratio of mtDNA to nDNA in purified lung epithelial cells derived from
  control and Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+ mice at 17.5 dpc (n = 4 for each group). f Measurement
  of relative ATP production in purified lung epithelial cells derived from control
  and Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+ mice at 13.5 (n = 4 for each group) and 17.5 (n = 4 for each
  group) dpc. g Immunostaining of lung sections collected from Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+
  mice and control littermates at 13.5 dpc. E-Cadherin (E-Cad) labeled all epithelial
  cells. The MTCO1 and MPC1 signals indicate the mitochondrial mass within individual
  epithelial cells. A reduction of MTCO1 and MPC1 signal in the lung epithelium of
  Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+ mice was detected. Scale bar = 5 μm. h Quantification of the
  relative MTCO1 and MPC1 signals in the lung epithelium (n = 3 for each group). Five
  views per lung (a total of 15 views) were used for counting. The signal density
  in control and mutant lungs was measured using ImageJ, and then divided by the corresponding
  number of cells. i Immunostaining of lung sections collected from Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+
  mice and control littermates at 17.5 dpc. MTCO1 signal was decreased in the lung
  epithelium of Rptorf/f; ShhCre/+ mice. Scale bar = 5 μm. j Quantification of the
  relative MTCO1 and MPC1 signals in the lung epithelium (n = 3 for each group). Five
  views per lung (a total of 15 views) were used for counting as in (h). All values
  are mean ± SEM. (*) p < 0.05; (**) p < 0.01; (***) p < 0.001; ns not significant
  (two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test). Source data are provided as a  file.'
