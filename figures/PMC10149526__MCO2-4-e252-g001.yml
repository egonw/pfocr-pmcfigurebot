caption: Proteomics and metabolomics showed significant changes in immune‚Äêrelated
  processes after sleep deprivation. Reactome analysis classified the signaling pathways
  and biological processes of the total differential proteins after sleep deprivation.
  (A) The Sankey diagram of signaling pathways. (B) Chord diagram of biological processes.
  The fold change of total differential proteins was the mean fold change related
  to baseline (day 1). (C) Metabolic pathway analysis for total differential metabolites
  in plasma after sleep deprivation; the top 10 pathways are shown. (D) The pathway
  map of arginine and proline metabolism and TCA cycle after sleep deprivation. The
  metabolite level is shown as blue to red, that is, from low level to high level.
  The protein expression is shown as green to orange, that is, from low expression
  to high expression. (E) Wukong Cloud platform for enrichment analysis of differential
  metabolites and proteins. Shown are the top three metabolic pathways, protein pathways
  and pathways of interaction between metabolism and protein.

  profiling changes caused by one night of sleep deprivation.
