caption: Role of zebrafish Wnt signaling pathway in Cd2+-induced microgliosis and
  neuroinflammation. (A–D) Morphological alterations of microglia in 6 dpf Tg(ApoE-EGFP)
  zebrafish larvae, and quantification of morphological parameters. (E,F) In vivo
  neuroimaging and microglia counting in the optic tectum region of 6 dpf zebrafish
  larvae. (G) Expression patterns of genes closely related with microgliosis and neuroinflammatory
  response. The numerical values are presented as either mean ± SEM in histograms,
  or median and mean, while whiskers show 90% confidence levels in boxplots. The results
  of either nonparametric test or ANOVA followed by multiple comparison test are listed
  in . “*” indicates significant differences (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
