caption: Profile of the running ES score and positions of gene set members on the
  rank ordered list. Area under the yellow plot indicates the significance level of
  pathway analysis. Each gene in the ECM-receptor pathway is shown in the plot by
  a bar line. Genes with higher expression change are located in the left side on
  the plot. The first gene (the most significant dysregulated gene) is the THBS2 that
  is located at the left side with higher score.

  Noncoding Diagnostic Biomarkers and Oncogenes of Gastric Cancer in the ECM-Receptor
  Interaction Signaling Pathway: Integrated System Biology and Experimental Investigation.'
