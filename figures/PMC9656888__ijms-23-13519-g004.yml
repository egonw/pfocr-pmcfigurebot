caption: Differently expressed genes (DEGs) viewed globally, which are involved in
  biotic attack responding pathways. DEGs were chosen for the metabolic pathway analysis
  using MapMan software. Different colors of boxes indicate the Log2 of the expression
  ratio of DEGs genes. Totals of 206, 98 and 81 DEGs were enriched in “signalling”,
  “secondary metabolism”, and “cell wall” pathways, most of these genes are upregulated.
