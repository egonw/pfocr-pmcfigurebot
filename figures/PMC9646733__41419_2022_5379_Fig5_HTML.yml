figure_title: RHBDL2 inhibits the degradation of N1ICD via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
caption: A N1ICD and RHBDL2 levels were confirmed by Western blot analysis in the
  indicated PC cells treated with 40 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX). The indicated PC
  cells were treated with chloroquine (B), NH4Cl (C), 3-MA (D), or MG132 (E), respectively.
  Then, the level of N1ICD was detected by Western blot analysis. F The PC cells were
  treated with 15 μM of MG132 for 6 h prior to harvest. Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated
  with Myc-tag antibody and immunoblotted as indicated.
article_title: RHBDL2 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic
  cancer by stabilizing the N1ICD via the OTUD7B and activating the Notch signaling
  pathway.
