caption: Integrin β3 promoted erlotinib resistance by upregulating AXL in NSCLC cells.
  (A,B) CCK-8 assay exploring the effect of ectopic expression of AXL (AXL cDNA) on
  cell viability in the absence (shβ3) of integrin β3 in HCC827 ER (A) and HCC4006
  ER (B) cells upon treatment with different concentrations of erlotinib. * represents
  shβ3 +Vector Ctrl vs. shCtrl +Vector Ctrl or shβ3 + AXL cDNA. (C,D) Western blot
  assays showing the efficiency of ectopic expression of AXL in integrin β3 knockdown
  (sh-β3) HCC827 ER (C) and HCC4006 ER (D) cells. (E,F) CCK-8 assay exploring the
  effect of depletion of AXL (si-AXL) on cell viability in the presence (+β3) of integrin
  β3 in HCC827 (E) and HCC4006 (F) cells upon treatment with different concentrations
  of erlotinib. (G,H) Western blot assays showing the efficiency of AXL depletion
  in integrin β3-overexpressing (+β3) HCC827 (G) and HCC4006 (H) cells. (C,D,G,H)
  β-actin was used as a loading control. (A,B,E,F) Data represent the means ± SEM,
  * p < 0.05. (A–H) n = 3 independent experiments.
