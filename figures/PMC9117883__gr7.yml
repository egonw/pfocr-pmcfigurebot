caption: 'The PGE2/PTGER1 signaling pathway mediates the cell protective effect of
  BL001(A) Expression levels of PTGERs were assessed in islets treated or not with
  1uM BL001. Expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene Gapdh. Results
  are expressed as means ± SEM.(B) Isolated mouse islets were treated or not with
  a cocktail of cytokines (CTK), BL001 and antagonists for either PTGER1 (ONO-8130)
  or PTGER4 (L-161,982). Cell death was assessed by ELISA quantification of mono-nucleosomes
  and oligo-nucleosomes released by apoptotic cells. Results are expressed as means ±
  SEM ∗∗p < 0.01, unpaired two-tailed t-test CTK versus BL001 and L-161,982 groups.(C)
  Representative immunofluorescence images of embedded islets treated or not with
  a cytokine cocktail, BL001 and/or the PTGER1 antagonist ONO-8130. Islet slices were
  stained for cleaved PARP (Cl.PARP, green) along with DAPI (blue) for nuclei staining.
  Scale bar: 25 μM. See also .'
