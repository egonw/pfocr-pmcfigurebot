caption: 'EDA alleviated the PM-induced inflammatory responses in vivo. Mice were
  intratracheally instilled with PM at 100 μg/day/mouse for 2 consecutive days. EDA
  (2, 10, or 20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected prior to PM exposure for 1 h.
  (a) Representative images of lung sections stained with H&E. (b) The inflammation
  score for images of lung sections stained with H&E. (c) The number of the total
  cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in BALF. Values are the mean ± SEM; ∗∗P < 0.01,
  compared with the control group; #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01, compared with the PM group;
  n = 5. EDA: edaravone; PM: particulate matter; BALF: bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.'
