caption: LUADSenLncSig-based GSEA of different risk groups. (A) Based on the GSEA
  results, the KEGG genes were differentially enriched for senescence-related lncRNA
  expression. Five KEGG items, the cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, oocyte meiosis,
  glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series, and adherens junction
  were enriched in the high-risk group. Asthma, intestinal immune network for IgA
  production, hematopoietic cell lineage, autoimmune thyroid disease, and T cell receptor
  signaling pathway were enriched in the low-risk group based on the NES, NOM p-value,
  and FDR q-value (B) Differential enrichment of genes in GO with senescence-related
  lncRNAs. Five GO items, spindle localization, establishment of spindle orientation,
  establishment of mitotic spindle localization, cadherin binding, and microtubule
  cytoskeleton organization involved in mitosis showed a significant differential
  enrichment in the high expression phenotype. The other five GO terms, negative regulation
  of adaptive immune response, mast cell activation involved in immune response, T
  cell activation involved in immune response, T cell differentiation involved in
  immune response, and negative regulation of B cell mediated immunity, were found
  significantly enriched in the low expression phenotype based on the NES, NOM p-value,
  and FDR q-value. The reference files from the (MSigDB) were c2. cp.kegg.v7.4. symbols.gmt
  and c5. go.v7.4 symbols. gmt (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp).
