caption: ceRNA analysis. miRNA-target gene interaction network (A). Red circles represent
  upregulated mRNAs, green circles represent downregulated mRNAs, orange hexagons
  represent upregulated miRNAs, blue hexagons represent downregulated miRNAs, arrows
  indicate the target genes regulated by the miRNAs and node size represents the degree
  of connectivity. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of miRNA target genes (B). The
  larger the nodes in the figure, the greater the ratio of the number of enriched
  genes to the total number of miRNA target genes, and colors ranging from blue to
  red indicate greater and greater P values. lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network (C).
  Red circles represent upregulated mRNAs, green circles represent downregulated mRNAs,
  light purple diamonds represent upregulated lncRNAs, dark purple diamonds represent
  downregulated lncRNAs and gray dotted lines represent co-expression relationships
  between mRNAs and lncRNAs. ceRNA network (D). Red circles represent upregulated
  mRNAs, light purple diamonds represent upregulated lncRNAs, blue hexagons represent
  downregulated miRNAs, green dotted lines represent the co-expression relationships
  between lncRNAs and mRNAs and gray arrows represent miRNA regulation. Blue T-shaped
  lines represent lncRNAs competing with miRNAs. Sankey diagram (E).
