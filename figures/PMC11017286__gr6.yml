caption: The landscape of signaling pathways associated with the differentially abundant
  proteins (DAPs) in ECC and CON.A, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed seven common
  significant signaling pathways in ECC and CON. B, a schematic representation displaying
  the mitochondrial matrix with the locations of complexes I and IV (upper panel).
  Heatmap showing the decreased DAPs in ECC (middle panel) and the increased DAPs
  in CON (lower panel) in complexes I and IV. Red represents higher abundance, and
  blue represents lower abundance. C, results of direct measurement of activities
  of complex I and Ⅳ in purified mitochondria from frozen muscle samples of ECC (n =
  5) and CON (n = 4). The activities of both complex I and Ⅳ were decreased in ECC-post
  in comparison to ECC-pre but increased in CON-post in comparison to CON-pre. D,
  heatmaps showing the increased DAPs in ECC and both increased and decreased DAPs
  in CON in extracellular receptor interaction. Red represents higher abundance, and
  blue represents lower abundance. E and F, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed five
  and eight specific signaling pathways in ECC and CON, respectively. G, location
  of the four DAPs in ECC in the pentose phosphate pathway. All four DAPs were increased
  (marked in red) with log2 FC greater than 0. H, boxplots of increased or decreased
  DAPs in CON involving posttranslational modifications and cytoskeleton. Values are
  expressed as mean ± SD (n = 4). ∗p value < 0.05, ∗∗p value < 0.01, ∗∗∗p value <
  0.001. COL1A1, collagen type I alpha 1 chain; CON, concentric; COL1A2, collagen
  type I alpha 2 chain; ECC, eccentric; ITGAV, integrin subunit alpha V; NDUFC1, NADH
  dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 subunit C1.
