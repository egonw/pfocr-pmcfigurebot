caption: Effects of SFN treatment on the expression of LC3 in epididymal fat of obese
  mice. Seven-week-old male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or control-fat diet
  (CFD) for 8 weeks. After fasting for 18 h, the mice were randomly divided into two
  groups and treated with DMSO (Control) or SFN for 3 h. (A, B) Western blotting of
  LC3 and p62 in epididymal fat. β-actin was used as an internal control. (C, D) LC3
  Ab and a secondary Ab conjugated to Alexa fluor 555 (red), and Perilipin Ab and
  a secondary Ab conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green). Nuclear staining with DAPI
  is shown in blue. Images were taken with a fluorescence microscope. Percentage colocalization
  of LC3 with perilipin. Scale bar=100 μm. Values are the mean±S.E.M. (n=4). *P<.05
  (two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test).
