caption: Interfering with DLGAP4 inhibits the PPARβ/δ signalling pathway and the expression
  of proliferation- and metastasis-related proteins. Western blotting was performed
  to measure the protein expression of DLGAP4, PPARβ/δ, CyclinD1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin
  in shNC or shDLGAP4 HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. The data were obtained from the average
  of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.
article_title: DLGAP4 acts as an effective prognostic predictor for hepatocellular
  carcinoma and is closely related to tumour progression.
