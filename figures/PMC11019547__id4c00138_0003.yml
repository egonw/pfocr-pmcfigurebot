caption: 2-TreNH2 treatment mimics the metabolic impact of treS deletion in Mtb. (A,
  B) Mtb H37Rv wild type was cultured under (A) planktonic or (B) biofilm growth conditions
  in the presence of 200 μM of the indicated trehalose analogue and growth was monitored
  over time. Mtb ΔtreS was included as a control. (C–J) Biofilm metabolomics analysis.
  Metabolomes from 28-day-old Mtb biofilm persisters after treatment with 0, 2, 20,
  and 200 μM 2- or 6-TreNH2 were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS). ΔtreS and treatment with the same amount of 6-TreAz were used
  as positive controls. (C, D) Biofilm metabolomics pattern analysis by clustered
  heatmap analysis (C) and PCA (D) plots. See Figure S18 for the chemical impact on
  Mtb metabolome in a concentration-dependent manner by PCA analysis. (E–J) Intracellular
  pool sizes of Mtb intermediates of trehalose metabolism (E, F), glycolysis (G, H),
  and pentose phosphate pathway (I, J) in Mtb wild type and ΔtreS biofilm persisters.
  All values are the average of independent biological triplicates ± standard error
  of the mean. **, P < 0.05; ns, not significant by Student t test.
