caption: Protective effect of exogenous proline during kanamycin stress and intracellular
  ROS levels. Exponentially growing cultures in SMM were treated with increasing kanamycin
  concentrations together with (B, D, F) or without (A, C, E) 40 mM of proline in
  SMM medium and incubated for 10 h at 37°C. (A) and (B) show the growth inhibition
  curves for cells without and with proline supplementation. (C) and (D). represent
  the relative fluorescent signal from dichlorofluorescein measured from the corresponding
  cultures. (E) and (F) show the activity of the PproHJ promoter, in this case, we
  used PproHJ‐tagRFP reporter strain to follow simultaneously the ROS formation and
  PproHJ activity. The black curve represents the outgrowth of control samples without
  antibiotic treatment. All measurements were performed in biological triplicates,
  and the mean values were plotted on the graphs. The relative fluorescent signal
  was estimated by dividing the fluorescent signal by the cell density. The value
  is represented in arbitrary units.
