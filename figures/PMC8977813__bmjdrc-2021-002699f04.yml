caption: 'Trimetazidine (TMZ) prevents muscle cells insulin resistance via the nuclear
  factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which regulates oxidative stress.
  PA, skeletal muscle cells treated with palmitate; siNC, treated with negative control
  small interfering RNA; siNrf2, treated with Nrf2 small interfering RNA; TMZ, skeletal
  muscle cells treated with TMZ. (A) Glucose uptake with insulin or with non-insulin;
  (B, C) IRS1, p-IRS1, AKT, and p-AKT protein expression were determined by western
  blot. *,**Represented p<0.05, p<0.01 in comparison with siNC group, respectively;
  #, ##represented p<0.05, p<0.01 in comparison with PA+siNC group, respectively;
  @,@@represented p<0.05, p<0.01 in comparison with PA+TMZ+ siNC group, respectively.
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PA, palmitate; p-AKT, phosphorylated
  protein kinase B (AKT); p-IRS1, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1).'

  muscle insulin resistance of mice through Nrf2 signaling.
