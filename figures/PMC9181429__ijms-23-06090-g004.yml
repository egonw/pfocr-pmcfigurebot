caption: 'Sialidase-3 overexpression in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. (A) Expression of sialidase
  Neu3 measured by Real Time PCR; (B) enzymatic activity of sialidase-3 measured on
  the synthetic substrate 4-Mu-NeuAc; (C) analysis of ganglioside GM3 by labeling
  with [3-3H]-sphingosine. Left panel (C): radiochromatographic image of HPTLC separation
  of gangliosides contained in the aqueous phase. Right panel (C): GM3 quantification
  expressed as dpm/mg protein. Each square in the graphs represent an experimental
  replicate. Statistical significance was determined by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
  test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.'
