caption: Canonical NF-κB signalling specifically activates global methylation of H3K27
  in glioblastoma. a NF-κB activation status in glioblastoma samples. Results showed
  by western blotting. b Protein expression of p65 and p-p65 in five general glioblastoma
  cell lines. Results showed by western blotting. c The LN229 and U251 cells were
  cultured in 5 µM bay11-7082 or 3 µM CAPE. Levels of histone lysine methylation were
  detected by western blotting. d LN229 and U251 cells were transfected with si NC
  oligos or si p65 oligos. Levels of histone lysine methylation were detected by western
  blotting. e Rescue experiment performed in LN229 and U251 cells. Results showed
  by western blotting. f, g The expression levels of H3K27me1/2/3 upon knockdown p65
  or NF-κB inhibitors in LN229 and U251 cells. Results showed by western blotting.
  Values are expressed as the means±SD from three experiments
