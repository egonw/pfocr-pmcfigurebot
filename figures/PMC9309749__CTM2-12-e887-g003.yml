caption: 'Ccr2‐KO mice exhibit increased accumulation of F‐actin through the enhancement
  of the MST1/mTORC1/DOCK8/WASP pathway. (A) Representative CFm images of pWASP, F‐actin
  and BCR (60× objective, scale bar = 2.5 μm). (B) Colocalisation between F‐actin
  and BCR. (C) Colocalisation between pWASP and BCR. (D) Filopodia dilatation visualised
  using electron microscopy (scale bar = 5 μm). (E) Quantitative analysis of number
  and length of the filopodia. (F) Representative total internal reflection fluorescence
  microscopy (TIRFm) images of F‐actin and pWASP at 3 and 5 min of activation (100× objective,
  scale bar = 2.5 μm). (G) The MFI of F‐actin. (H) The MFI of pWASP. (I) Representative
  TIRFm images of pCD19 at 3 and 5 min of activation (100× objective, scale bar = 2.5
  μm). (J) Quantitative analysis of B‐cell area in the contact zone (under interference
  reflection microscopy). (K) Quantitative analysis of pCD19 MFI. (L) Western blotting
  of DOCK8, pMST1, MST1, pWASP and pEZRIN levels. (M) Western blotting of DOCK8, pMST1,
  pSHIP‐1, pBTK, pCD19, pmTOR, pAKT, pPI3k, pFOXO1 and pS6 protein expression levels
  in WT, Ccr2‐KO B cells and Ccr2‐KO B cells treated with XMU‐MP‐1. (N) Western blotting
  of DOCK8, pMST1 and pWASP levels in WT, Ccr2‐KO B cells and Ccr2‐KO B cells treated
  with rapamycin. All images were representative images from three independent experiments.
  Error bars were shown as mean (± SD). *p < .05, **p < .01, ****p < .0001, ****p < .0001,
  ns: no statistical significance'
