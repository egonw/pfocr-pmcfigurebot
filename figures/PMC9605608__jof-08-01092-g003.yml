caption: Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs that identified
  between E+ and E− host roots at 0 and 200 mM NaCl concentrations. The GO terms of
  up-regulated (A) and down-regulated (B) DEGs between 0RE+ and 0RE−, The GO terms
  of up-regulated (C) and down-regulated (D) DEGs between 200RE+ and 200RE−. “Rich
  factor” represents the ratio of the enriched DEGs to the total genes annotated in
  the corresponding pathway. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated (E)
  and down-regulated (F) DEGs identified between roots of E+ and E− plants under 0
  and 200 mM NaCl concentrations. Color panels show the p-value of KEGG pathway enrichment
  among the comparisons.
