caption: 'Overview of the OSM signaling pathways. OSM–receptor hetero-dimerization
  drives JAKs’ recruitment. The C-terminal region of receptor types I and II contains
  tyrosine residues, which, phosphorylated by JAK1/2, act as a docking site for STAT1
  and STAT3. OSM can also activate other downstream proteins such as ERK1/2, p38,
  JNK, the PI3K/Akt pathway, and PKCδ. OSM: oncostatin M; JAKs: Janus kinases; Erk1/2:
  extracellular-regulated kinase ½; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; STAT: signal
  transducer and activator of transcription; JNK: Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC: protein
  kinase C.'
