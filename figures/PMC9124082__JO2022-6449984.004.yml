caption: Sea cucumber saponins induced DNA damage and apoptosis of triple-negative
  breast cancer (TNBC) cells. (a) Western blot was used to detect the phosphorylation
  of H2AX in both cells. (c) MDA-MB-231 and 4 T1 cells were treated with 0.5 and 1 μM
  stichloroside C2 (STC2) for 24 h. The cells were digested and collected. The Annexin
  V-FITC apoptosis kit was used to treat the cells. The average fluorescence intensity
  of Annexin V/PI was determined by flow cytometry. (e) Bax and cleaved PARP protein
  expression levels were detected by western blot. (b, d, and f) Prism 8.0 was used
  for the statistical analysis of experimental data, which were expressed as the mean
  ± SEM of three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared
  to the control group.
