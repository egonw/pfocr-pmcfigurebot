caption: Astragaloside IV-PESV could affect the composition of the gut microbiota
  of PCa mice. A. PCa nude mice and tumor plots. B. Body weight. C. The data of four-week
  tumor volume. D. Tumor mass. E. HE staining plots of tumor tissues. F. IHC was used
  to analyze the Ki67 positive rate of tumor tissues. G. The mRNA level of RAGE in
  tumor tissues. H.The protein level of RAGE in tumor tissues. I. The protein level
  of NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-6 in tumor tissues. Western blot was used to detect the protein
  expression levels of NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-6 in tumor tissues. *, P < 0.05 compared
  with the Control group
