caption: Expression of mTOR in keloid tissues. (A) Phosphorylation of mTOR is increased
  in active keloid scars compared to normal tissue specimens. The scale bar indicates
  500 Î¼m. (B) Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the p-mTOR signaling was increased
  by 21.3-fold in keloid tissue compared to normal tissue (** p < 0.01). (C) mTOR
  phosphorylation is increased in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts in keloid tissue.
