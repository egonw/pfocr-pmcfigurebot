caption: circ_0006427 targeted miR-346 and modulated multiplication, migration, invasion
  and EMT of NSCLC cells. A. miR-346 expression in A549 and H292 cells transfected
  with circ_0006427 overexpression plasmid or co-transfected with miR-346 mimics was
  detected by qRT-PCR. B. CCK-8 assay was utilized to detect the multiplication of
  NSCLC cells after the transfection. C, D. Transwell experiments were exploited to
  detect migration and invasion of NSCLC cells after the transfection. E and F. Western
  blot was applied to determine E-cadherin and Vimentin protein expressions in NSCLC
  cells. Original blots are shown in  (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org),
  Figure 4E. All experiments were repeated thrice with triplicate samples in each
  experiment. *; P<0.05, EMT; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NSCLC; Non-small
