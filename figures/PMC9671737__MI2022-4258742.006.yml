caption: ST3GAL3 promoted the proliferation and migration of MH7A cells by activating
  the TLR9/MyD88 pathway. (a) The sequences of CpG-ODNs (CpG 2216 and CpG 2006). (b)
  MTT assay results showed that transfection of MH7A cells with si-TLR9 reversed the
  effects of ST3GAL3 on cell proliferation. (c) MTT assay results showed that adding
  with CpG-ODNs reversed the effects of si-ST3GAL3 on MH7A cell proliferation. (d)
  Representative images of cell migration from transwell assay. (e) Transwell assay
  results showed that transfection of MH7A cells with si-TLR9 reversed the effects
  of ST3GAL3 on cell migration. (f) Transwell assay results showed that adding with
  CpG-ODNs reversed the effects of si-ST3GAL3 on MH7A cell migration. n = 3. ∗∗p <
  0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared with the indicated group.
