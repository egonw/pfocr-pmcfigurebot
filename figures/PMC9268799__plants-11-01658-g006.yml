caption: The cytotoxic effects of extracts of Centipeda minima (CMX) and brevilin
  A on AGS human gastric cancer cells. (A) The dose-dependent effect of CMX on the
  viability of AGS cells. (B) The chemical structures of brevilin A. The dose-dependent
  effect of (C) brevilin A and (D) cisplatin on the viability of AGS cells. (E) Hoechst
  33342 staining of AGS cells treated with CMX and brevilin A. Brightly stained condensed
  nuclei (white arrow). Scale bar, 40 Âµm. The experiments were performed in triplicate.
  The error bars represent the standard deviation of samples (n = 3). * p < 0.05 compared
  with that of the control.
