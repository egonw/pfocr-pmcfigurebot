caption: KEGG pathway, coexpression network, and drug‚Äêgene interaction analysis of
  the hub genes. (a) The most significant pathway and related genes. The results show
  that these hub genes are mainly involved in the P53 signaling pathway, TP53 regulates
  transcription of cell cycle genes and TP53 regulates transcription of genes involved
  in G2 cell cycle arrest. (b) Hub genes and their coexpression genes were analyzed
  using GeneMANIA. (c) Drug-gene interaction diagram, the yellow circle indicates
  the differentially expressed gene and the blank square indicates the drug.
