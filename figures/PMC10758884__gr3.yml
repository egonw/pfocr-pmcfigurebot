caption: CAP activation downregulated LPS/D-GalN-Induced intrahepatic cell adhesion
  molecules expression. (A) KEGG enrichment analysis of most significantly enriched
  signaling pathways from the control and LPS/D-GalN-induced ALF mice according to
  the RNA sequencing assay of liver (n = 3). (B) Heatmap of the DEGs of liver related
  to lymphocyte migration in the control and LPS/D-GalN-induced ALF mice (n = 3).
  (C) Volcano plot showing DEGs in the livers of LPS/D-GalN and the PNU+ LPS/D-GalN
  mice (n = 3). (D) KEGG enrichment analysis of most significantly enriched signaling
  pathways in the livers of LPS/D-GalN- and the PNU+ LPS/D-GalN mice (n = 3). (E)
  Heatmap for the DEGs in the livers of LPS/D-GalN- and PNU+LPS/D-GalN mice (n = 3).
