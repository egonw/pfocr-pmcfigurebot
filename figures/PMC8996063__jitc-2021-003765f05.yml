caption: Oncogenic pathway, tumor immune microenvironment score and prognosis in lung
  cancers. (A) The impact of oncogenic signaling pathways on T-scores, I-scores and
  S-scores in lung cancers are examined. The fraction of samples with at least one
  alteration detected in five signaling pathways are shown in low or high T-scores,
  I-scores and S-scores. (B) and C), T-scores, I-scores and S-scores (B) and overall
  survival (C) are compared between the cases with and without signaling pathway alterations.
  *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; ns, not significant.
