caption: 'Overexpression of OsABT enhances the salt tolerance of rice seedlings. (A–C)
  Phenotypes of two-week-old OsABT–OE lines (OE–3 and OE–4) and wild-type (WT) plants
  under 200 mM NaCl for 0, 12 and 24 h. Scale Bar: 5 cm. (D–I) Relative leaf water
  content; root activity; relative root and leaf conductivity; root and leaf malondialdehyde
  (MDA) content of OsABT–OE lines and WT under 200 mM NaCl for 0, 12, and 24 h. Data
  are means ± SD of three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate significant
  differences compared to WT plants at * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test).'
