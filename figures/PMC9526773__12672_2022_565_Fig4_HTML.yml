caption: Inverse relationship between PLA2G4F and KMT2A expression in metastatic prostate
  cancer. A Expression of KMT2A across the LuCaP PDX models in our study displayed
  as a heatmap, indicating which models are classified as KMT2A high or low. B Heatmap
  of anti-AR and anti-HOXB13 ChIP-seq [] peak signals (aggregated across samples as
  indicated) around TSS regions (± 3 kb) in LuCaP PDX's with differential KMT2A expression.
  Each row is a peak ranked by KMT2A low to high. The location of PLA2G4F on heatmap
  is marked by a black bar. C Functional enrichment from Ingenuity Upstream Pathway
  Analysis of anti-AR and anti-HOXB13 ChIP-seq differential peaks overlapping genes
  for pathways with P < 0.1. Red indicates that PLA2G4F is present in the pathway
  gene set. D Integrative genome viewer tracks of the PLA2G4F gene locus from anti-AR
  and anti-HOXB13 ChIP-seq. LNCaP DNase-hypersensitivity regions shown in blue. E–H
  Spearman correlation of the log2 CPM expression level of PLA2G4F with log2 CPM expression
  level of KMT2A (E, G) or the 54-gene ssGSEA MYC activity score (F, H) in the LuCaP
  (E, F) or the West Coast Dream Team-Prostate Cancer Foundation metastatic CRPC cohort
  (G, H). Samples with log2 CPM PLA2G4F < 0 were excluded. The error bars represent
  the 95% confidence bands for linear regression
