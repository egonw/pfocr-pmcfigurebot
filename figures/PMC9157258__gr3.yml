caption: 'Redox modulation of HSPC proteins forms an additional layer of regulation
  in fetal cells.a-b PANTHER protein classes (a) and GO enrichment of biological processes
  (b) of redox regulated proteins (with significantly differentially oxidized cysteine(s)
  between fetal and adult HSPCs, and/or oxidation on the specific cysteine site(s)
  only in fetus or adult cells). c Functionally grouped annotation network (analyzed
  by ClueGO) [] of two protein clusters: protein level differences (purple) and protein
  oxidation differences (green; if more peptides of one protein were identified the
  peptide with the highest oxidation is included) between fetal and adult HSPCs. The
  size of the node reflects the statistical significance of the term for both clusters.
  The relative proportion of the respective color in the pie chart is equal to the
  relative proportion of genes from each cluster associated with the enriched GO term.
  The degree of connectivity between terms (edges) is calculated using kappa statistics.
  The group leading term is the most significant term of the group. The label color
  of the group leading term represents the cluster (protein level or protein oxidation)
  with majority of genes that are enriched for the terms belonging to the group. Common
  background was used as a reference set. d GO enrichment for proteins with cysteines
  significantly higher oxidized in fetal HSPCs for overrepresentation of biological
  processes. Redundant GO terms were filtered out. e Heatmap represents oxidation
  level (%) of peptides with significantly changed cysteine oxidation (adjusted p-value
  < 0.05) between fetal and adult HSPCs and peptides with cysteines found to be oxidized
  only in fetus (3: 0 fetal: adult valid values; marked with red frames) that are
  involved in metabolic processes in three biological replicates. TCA: Tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; PPP: Pentoso-phosphate pathway; m.: metabolism. f GO enrichment for
  proteins with cysteines significantly higher oxidized in fetal HSPCs for overrepresentation
  of molecular function. Redundant GO terms were filtered out. g Schematic picture
  of cysteine oxidation of nuclear pore complex proteins, which affects macromolecular
  transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version
  of this article.)'
