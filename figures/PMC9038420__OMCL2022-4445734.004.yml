caption: Exercise exerts endogenous antioxidant regulation through the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway to fight brain oxidative stress injury caused by METH. Exercise has great
  potential to play an endogenous antioxidant regulatory role through the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway to decrease harms caused by methamphetamine-induced oxidative stress. However,
  more experimental evidence is needed to support this idea. Further exploration of
  the different effects of various parameters of an exercise intervention on Nrf2
  signaling pathway intervention (such as exercise mode, time, and intensity) is needed.
  Whether there is a synergistic effect between exercise and phytonutrient Nrf2 activators
  is worth further investigation. Created with http://BioRender.com.
