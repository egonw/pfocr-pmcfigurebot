figure_title: CHD4 knockdown results in aberrant gene expression unrelated to breast
  cancer program
caption: (a) Volcano plot showing differential gene expression upon CHD4 depletion.
  FDR < 0.05 and |fold change|> 1.5 were applied to define differentially expressed
  genes. (b) Gene expression of ATAC-seq differential peak associated genes. Box plots
  show log2 fold changes from each peak group. Increased, decreased, and randomly
  selected unchanged peaks are assigned to closest genes. (c) Pathway enrichment analysis.
  Most significantly altered genes (fold change +/âˆ’ 2) were used for Go term Cellular
  Component (CC) analysis by DAVID. Top 10 pathways are indicated. (d) Functional
  annotation of up-regulated genes in CHD4 KD cells. DAVID tissue expression annotation
  was performed using up-regulated genes. (e) Gene expression of AP1 family proteins.
  ATAC-seq differential peak associated genes. Heatmap shows log2 fold changes in
  CHD4 KD cells compared to control shRNA condition.
