caption: 'KCNN4 enhances metabolic fitness in LCSCs by upregulating glucose metabolism:
  (A–D) OCR and ECAR were measured in non-CSCs and CSCs, respectively. Mito-stress
  test was shown as (A,C), and glycolysis stress test as (B,D). Relative expression
  of rate-limiting enzyme genes of metabolic pathways in CSCs and non-CSCs of two
  cell lines, in HepG2 (E) and in Huh7 (F,G). mRNA expression of glycolysis pathway
  key enzymes, including LADH, GLUT1, HK2, PFK1, and PKM, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
  (PDHC), and mitochondrial biosynthesis key enzymes, including TFAM, PGC1a, and NRF1,
  were detected as (E–G). These data represent the mean ± SD from at least three independent
  experiments. Two-way Student’s t-test. mRNA expression levels were normalized by
  β-actin endogenous control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.'
