caption: 'Proliferative IH tissues present some features of neuroendocrine tumors.
  (A) Immunostaining for Chromogranin A (CgA) counterstained with hemalun. CgA-positive
  cells appear in brown. Scale bar size is 100µm. While high expression levels of
  CgA are detected in untreated proliferative IHs, low levels are detected in involutive
  IHs and other vascular tumors, including rapidly involutive congenital hemangiomas
  (RICH) and pyogenic granulomas. The adrenal gland used as a positive control. (B,C)
  Model outlining IH responses to propranolol. (B) Electron microscopy of IH vessel
  showing endothelial cells surrounded by pericytes and telopodes of telocytes in
  perivascular space. Scale bar size is 5 µm. (C) IH-EC, -PER and -TC express the
  first three enzymes involved in catecholamine biosynthesis pathway, enabling them
  to release NA locally. Our previous data [,] demonstrated that beta-adrenergic receptors
  are present on IH-EC, -PER, -TC and mast cells. It is likely that NA-mediated activation
  of ADRB in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner results in activation of proangiogenic
  signaling pathways in different cell types, leading to dramatic growth and development
  of blood vessels. Propranolol antagonizes a proangiogenic NA effect through binding
  to ADRB receptors. NA: noradrenaline, IH: infantile hemangioma.'
