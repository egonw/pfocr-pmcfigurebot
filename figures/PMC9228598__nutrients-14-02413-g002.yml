caption: Determination of resveratrol (RSV) concentration threshold for inducing lethal
  autophagy in A549 and BEAS-2B cells. A549 cells (A) and BEAS-2B cells (B) were treated
  with RSV (0–150 μM) in the presence or absence of 5 mM 3-MA for 48 h. Cell viability
  was determined by the MTT assay. The data are presented as mean ± SD from three
  independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group.
