caption: BASP1 enhances EGFR signaling in HUVECs. (a) The effect of high glucose on
  EGFR expression was detected by western blot. (b) The effect of BASP1 silencing
  on EGFR expression was detected by western blot. (c) Cells were treated with 100 μM
  cycloheximide (CHX) for 0–24 h to detect the degradation of EGFR protein. (d) A
  schematic diagram of action of BASP1 in the regulation of EGFR signaling. (e) The
  effect of BASP1 silencing on Wnt/β‐catenin and Dll4/Notch1 signaling pathway was
  detected by western blot. *P‐value <0.05 and **<0.01 compared with the Scramble
  group.
