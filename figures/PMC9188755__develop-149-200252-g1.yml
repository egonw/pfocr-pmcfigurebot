caption: 'FGFR inhibition does not induce apoptosis. TUNEL assay (red) and DAPI (blue)
  staining in control, SU5402- and DNase I-treated embryos fixed at G6 (A-F), N1 (G-L),
  N2 (M-R), N4 (S-X), N5 (Y-D′) and T0 (E′-J′) stages. Dorsal views, except for T0
  stage embryo pictures (lateral views). Anterior towards the left and dorsal towards
  the top in T0 stage embryo pictures. The inset shows that the TUNEL labelling does
  not coincide with the nuclei labelling. At least 10 embryos per stage were analysed
  and they all showed the same pattern. Scale bars: 50 µm.'
article_title: Functions of the FGF signalling pathway in cephalochordates provide
  insight into the evolution of the prechordal plate.
