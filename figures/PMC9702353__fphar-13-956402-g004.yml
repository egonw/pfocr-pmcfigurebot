caption: 'FLaAN/C alleviated MOG-induced oxidative stress in the spinal cord of EAE
  mice. (A) Abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in spinal cord detected by
  DHE staining (scale bars: 100 μm). (B–C) Representative immunofluorescent images
  of 3-NT (B) and 4HNE (C) in the spinal cord of all experimental mice (scale bars:50 μm).
  (D–F) The activity levels of MDA (D), SOD (E) and CAT (F) in the serum of each group
  of mice. Paraffin sections of spinal cord tissue used for immunofluorescence staining.
  Data are shown as means ± SD (n = 6 per group). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001;
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001. * vs. Control group; # vs. MOG group.'
