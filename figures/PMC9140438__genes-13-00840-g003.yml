caption: The scatter plots of the KEGG pathway and the GO enrichment. (A) The top
  20 KEGG pathways are shown in a scatter plot. (B) The scatter plot of the top 10
  separate GO terms. The Rich factor is the proportion of DEGs numbers among all gene
  numbers (in the database), indicated in the pathway term that is linked to it. KEGG,
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GO, gene ontology; DEGs, differentially
  expressed genes; BP, biological process; MF, molecular function; and CC, cellular
  component.
