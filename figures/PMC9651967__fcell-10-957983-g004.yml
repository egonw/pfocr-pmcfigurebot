caption: Pathways and kinases enriched in NACT resistant TSCC patients. (A) Top ten
  pathways significantly enriched in proteomic and phosphoproteomic data. Reactome
  pathway analysis of dysregulated proteins and differentially phosphorylated proteins
  revealed dysregulation of many pathways. Formation of cornified envelope is the
  most enriched in proteomic data. In phosphoproteomic data Rho GTPase cycle, Signalling
  by Rho GTPases, Signaling by Rho GTPases, Miro GTPases and RHOBTB3 were top three
  enriched pathways. (B) Kinases identified in the dataset. The kinome map was generated
  using KinMap tool.
