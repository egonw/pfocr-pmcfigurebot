figure_title: Representative macrolide biosynthetic pathways
caption: a The late pikromycin/(neo)methymycin biosynthetic pathway in which the glycosyltransferase-mediated
  sugar attachment precedes the P450-catalyzed hydroxylation. b The partial avermectin
  biosynthetic pathway with an order of oxidation-glycosylation. c The post-PKS pathway
  of mycinamicin biosynthesis with staggered monooxygenation and glycosylation steps.
  The functional groups introduced by P450 are highlighted in red, and the functional
  groups introduced by glycosyltransferase are highlighted in blue.
