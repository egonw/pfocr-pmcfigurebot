caption: Dopamine signaling pathways crosstalk with Wnt/β‐catenin/GSK‐3β cascade.
  Simplified representation of the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway and its intersection
  with DRD2 signaling. Wnt signal activation is tightly controlled by a dynamic signaling
  complex comprised of core receptors from the Frizzled (Fzds) family of G protein‐coupled
  receptors (GPCRs), the low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor‐related protein (LRP)
  5/6 co‐receptors, and the disheveled (Dvl) and Axin adapters. Binding of Wnt1‐like
  endogenous/exogenous agonists to Fzd triggers a molecular cascade leading to the
  cytoplasmic accumulation of β‐catenin, which enters the nucleus, and associates
  with T‐cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors,
  in turn promoting the transcription of Wnt target genes. β‐Catenin is tightly regulated
  via phosphorylation by the ‘destruction complex’, consisting of glycogen synthase
  kinase‐3β (GSK‐3β), casein kinase 1α (CK1α), the scaffold protein Axin, and the
  tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). DRD2 downstream intracellular
  G protein‐independent, arrestin‐dependent pathways can target Wnt/β‐catenin signaling,
  intersecting GSK‐3β, through the contribution serine/threonine kinase (AKT)‐mediated
  phosphorylation. Crosstalk between DRD2 and Wnt signaling can relieve β‐catenin
  from active GSK‐3 phosphorylation, thus permitting β‐catenin translocation in the
  nucleus activating transcription of Wnt‐dependent genes involved in proliferation,
  differentiation, neuroprotection and immunomodulation (detailed in the text)
