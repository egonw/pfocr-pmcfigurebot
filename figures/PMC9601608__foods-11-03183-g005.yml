caption: 'Phycocyanin promotes the activity of the AKT and AMPK pathway in diabetic
  mice. (A) Western blot analysis of the AKT signaling pathway in the NC, T2DM, THPC,
  and T groups. (B) Western blot analysis of the expressions of the AMPKα and IRS
  proteins in the NC, T2DM, THPC, and T groups. Data are expressed as means ± SD for
  random three mice. * (p < 0.05) and ** (p < 0.01) represent groups with significant
  differences compared with the NC group. # (p < 0.05) and ## (p < 0.01) represent
  groups with significant differences compared with the T2DM group. The dots in the
  histogram represent the three different grey values of the Western blot samples.'
