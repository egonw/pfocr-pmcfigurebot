caption: Vascular permeability induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by endothelial
  integrin αVβ3. (A) Pharmacological inhibitors of Src (SU6656, 1 µM), FAK (PF562271,
  1 µM), and integrin αVβ3 (Cilengitide, 0.0005 µM) incubated with SARS-CoV-2 infected
  endothelial cells. **** p < 0.0001, One-way ANOVA. Values are mean ± S.E.M., n =
  3. (B) Schematic depiction of the proposed pathway of integrin engagement with spike
  protein and subsequent signaling cascade leading to the disease phenotype of hyperpermeability.
  Top panel portrays a healthy endothelial cell, where VE-Cadherin and Rac1 regulate
  and maintain low RhoA levels through FAK and Src signaling. Rac1 and RhoA signaling
  is tightly controlled via integrin engagement with an extracellular ligand. Bottom
  panel portrays an infected endothelial cell, where persistent integrin activation
  leads to overactive FAK and Src activity, resulting in faulty cycling between RhoA
  and Rac1. RhoA levels rise, leading to Cadherin phosphorylation via Src and FAK.
  Catenins, which confine VE-Cadherin at the endothelial junctions, cannot recognize
  phosphorylated VE-Cadherin which results in its internalization. This causes endothelial
  cells to pull apart and hyperpermeability to occur, promoting vascular leakage.
