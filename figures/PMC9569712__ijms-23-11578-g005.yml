caption: Effects of (+)-α-pinene exposure on H2O2 generation and the activities of
  antioxidant enzyme in D. armandi. The surviving adults were collected at 24, 48,
  and 72 h post exposure to LC50 (+)-α-pinene. The H2O2 content (A,E) and the activities
  of SOD (B,F), CAT (C,G), and POD (D,H) in the midgut of adults were determined spectrophotometrically.
  The asterisk indicates a significant difference between different treatment groups
  (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, independent Student’s t-test). All values are the mean
  ± SE, n = 3.
