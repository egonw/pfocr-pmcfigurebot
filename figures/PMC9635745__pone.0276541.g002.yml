figure_title: ATRA regulates RAR genes, TOP2 genes, and downstream ACT response genes
  in human cardiomyocytes
caption: (a) Fold-change in gene expression of RARG, RARB, RARA, TOP2A and TOP2B during
  control (vehicle) or doxorubicin (1 μM) or ATRA (500 nM) treatment. Data are presented
  as mean ± standard deviation (two independent experiments were performed, the extracted
  RNA was combined, and gene expression assay was performed as three technical replicates,
  N = 3). Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple
  comparisons correction (comparisons between the control vs. doxorubicin and control
  vs. ATRA are shown, *, and **** denote P = 0.012, P < 0.0001, respectively). (b)
  Fold-change in gene expression of the genes involved in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis
  (FAS, APAF1, TP53INP1, and BAX) and doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction
  (PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, and ATP5F1A) during control (vehicle) or doxorubicin (1 μM)
  or ATRA (500 nM) treatment. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (two
  independent experiments were performed, the extracted RNA was combined, and gene
  expression assay was performed as three technical replicates, N = 3). Statistical
  analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction
  (comparisons between the control vs. doxorubicin and control vs. ATRA are shown,
  **, *** and **** denote, P = 0.0059, P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001, respectively).
