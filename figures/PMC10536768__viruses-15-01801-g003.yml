caption: An overview of the innate response to AAV vectors. (A) Upon AAV infection,
  AAV’s genome DNA can act as PAMP, leading to the activation of TLR2 and TLR9. Then,
  TLRs activate NF-κB and IRF7 via MyD88 signaling pathway, this activation ultimately
  regulates the production of IFN-I and ISGs [,,]. (B) The ITR structure of the AAV
  genome may activate cytoplasmic DNA to induce cGAS and antiviral genes and activate
  the cGAS-STING signaling pathway []. (C) Due to the promoter activity of the ITR
  of AAV, AAV may form dsRNA in target cells and trigger the RIG-I/MDA5-mediated RLR-MAVS
  innate immune signaling pathway [,]. The “(?)” in the figure implies that dsRNA
  could be theoretically formed during this process, but has not been demonstrated
  so far.
