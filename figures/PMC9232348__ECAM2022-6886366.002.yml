caption: 'Curcumin increases the DDP sensitivity of resistant NSCLC cells. (a, b)
  The combined effect of different concentrations of DDP and curcumin (2.5 μg/mL)
  on cell viability of A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells. (c, d) After the cells were cotreated
  by DDP and curcumin (2.5 μg/mL), cell viability and cell apoptosis were detected
  by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. (e, f) The expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved
  PARP were detected by western blotting. Experiment data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation (SD), each experiment was conducted 3 times. ∗P < 0.05, when compared
  with the DDP group; #P < 0.05, when compared with the control group; &P < 0.05,
  when compared with the DDP or curcumin group. DDP, cisplatin; NSCLC, non-small-cell
  lung cancer.'
