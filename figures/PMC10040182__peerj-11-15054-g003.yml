figure_title: The bubble plot of the enriched functional pathways of the differentially
  expressed mRNAs between the normal group and ARC group (based on p-value < 0.05)
caption: (A) The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis shows that the differentially expressed
  genes are mainly enriched in the biological pathways of extracellular matrix organization
  and extracellular structure organization; (B) the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes are mostly
  enriched in human papillomavirus infection, breast cancer, and the Wnt signaling
  pathway.
