caption: Anti-inflammatory effect of LEV. Seizures induces the activation of microglia,
  which in turn releases proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, etc.
  These cytokines promote the brain blood– brain barrier (BBB) damage and sustained
  neuronal inflammation leading to seizures and neurodegeneration, which activates
  further inflammation, establishing a vicious circle. The anti-inflammatory mechanism
  of LEV may be related to the voltage-activated Ca2+ channel inhibition present in
  the microglia (purple cell). This results in glia non-activation and thus the attenuation
  of inflammation. LEV also inhibits the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. LEV can act
  as an HDAC inhibitor promoting the transcription of antioxidant and cytoprotective
  genes, restoring the oxidation–reduction balance.
