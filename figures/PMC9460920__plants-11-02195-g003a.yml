caption: Anti-cancer effects of the SSE extract. (A) Effects of extract on WNT/Beta-catenin
  and TGF-beta signaling pathways. A549 cells were incubated with the extract for
  6 h and levels of β-catenin and TGF-beta were assessed by immunoblotting with the
  corresponding antibodies. (A) Levels of β-catenin and level of SMAD2. (B) Real-Time
  PCR measurement of cancer-related pathways’ genes. On the left, Spliceosome genes
  (SRSF11 and PNN), and on the right genes belong to the Cell cycle pathway described
  (CCP110 and CEP152). Results are representative of three biological replicates (n
  = 3). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005; ****, p < 0.001 (treated vs. control).
  (C) Cell cycle analysis. Flow Cytometry analysis of non-treated (on the left) and
  extract-treated (for 24 h) (on the right) A549 lung cancer cells. The Bar graph
  below shows the quantitative analysis of the flow cytometry experiments described
  above (n = 3). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. *, p < 0.05.
