figure_title: Differential fibroblast gene expression and secreted protein analysis
caption: (A) Hierarchical clustering of 1948 differentially expressed gene probes
  in MRC5, CAF7 and CAF12 (A; see Methods for scoring procedure). (B and C) IGF1R
  pathway components that were significantly (P<0.05 by two-tailed, two-sample unequal
  variance t tests) differentially expressed in either CAF7 or CAF12 compared to MRC5
  (each n=3 biological replicates; B), and in PC9GR compared to PC9 cells (n=3; C).
  (D) Comparison of 2,330 proteins identified by secretome analysis based on the average
  abundance (ave riBAQ) of each protein in CAF7 and CAF12 (n=6) and the ratio of each
  protein identified in CAF7 and CAF12 compared to MRC5 (n=3). Dashed lines indicate
  the top 2.5% most-abundant secreted proteins and a ratio of 1.5-fold increased or
  decreased. (E) Log2 ratio of each secreted protein identified in CAF7 and CAF12
  compared to MRC5 and significance of these differences. Dashed lines indicate a
  log2 ratio of ± 0.58 (1.5-fold increased or decreased) and −log(p-value) greater
  than 1.3 (P<0.05 by a two-tailed, two-sample equal variance t test), comparing the
  riBAQ values for CAF7 and CAF12 to the riBAQ values for MRC5 from (D). (F) Western
  blot analysis of total protein levels of IGFBP5, IGFBP6 and IGFBP7 in the indicated
  cell lines. Actin, loading control (LI-COR scans in ). Dashed line indicates removed
  lanes. Blot shown is representative of two biological replicates.
