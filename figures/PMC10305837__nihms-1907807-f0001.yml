figure_title: Brequinar-resistant PDAC cell lines maintain pyrimidine pools and continue
  proliferation under DHODH inhibition
caption: A) Schematic of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, with DHODH step
  blocked by BQ. B) BQ dose-response cell viability experiments were performed on
  a panel of human and murine PDAC cell lines. Cells were treated with indicated doses
  of BQ for 72 hours and viability was determined by CellTiter Glo assay. Data represent
  mean +/− SEM of at least 3 biological replicates. C) CFPAC-1 (left) or S2–013 (right)
  cells were cultured with indicated BQ concentrations for four passages. Cells were
  counted by image cytometry at each passage. D) Brightfield images of BQ-sensitive
  CFPAC-1 cells (top) or BQ-resistant S2–013 cells (bottom) after 72 hour exposure
  to the indicated dose of BQ, captured by image cytometry. E-I) CFPAC-1 or S2–013
  cells were treated with indicated concentrations of BQ or vehicle for 8 hours and
  subjected to LC-MS/MS metabolomics analysis of polar metabolites. E) Principal component
  analysis (PCA) plot for CFPAC-1 (left) or S2–013 (right) cells. Each data point
  represents an individual biological replicate. F) Heatmap for top 50 differentially
  altered metabolites in BQ-treated vs control groups. Pyrimidine pathway metabolites
  are highlighted in violet. G) Pathway enrichment analysis for KEGG pathways significantly
  altered upon BQ-treatment. H) Quantification of relative abundance of indicated
  metabolites, normalized to respective vehicle-treated control. Data represent mean
  +/− SEM of 4 biological replicates. * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA
  with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test.
