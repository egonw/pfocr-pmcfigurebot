caption: A possible mechanism underlying the effect of ZSCAN18 on glioblastoma cells.
  ZSCAN18 might directly suppress the GLI1 gene expression. Because GLI1 supports
  glioblastoma cell proliferation and chemoresistance, ZSCAN18 inhibits the proliferation
  and increases the drug sensitivity of glioblastoma cells. In addition, through an
  unidentified pathway, ZSCAN18 inhibits the self-renewal of glioblastoma cells.
article_title: Zinc finger and SCAN domain-containing 18 suppresses the proliferation,
  self-renewal, and drug resistance of glioblastoma cells.
