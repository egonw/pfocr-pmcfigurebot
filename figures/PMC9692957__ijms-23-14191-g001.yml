caption: The main components of the hedgehog pathway. Membrane proteins are either
  blue or red, inactive proteins are green and active proteins are colored pink. The
  red crosses indicate target proteins for hedgehog inhibitors (HHis). In canonical
  hedgehog (HH) signaling, HH ligands are modified by hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT)
  and released from HH-secreting cells. HH ligands then bind to the cell membrane
  protein patched (PTCH), which leads to release of smoothened (SMO). SMO moves to
  the primary cilium where it prevents breakdown of GLI family zinc finger proteins
  (GLI) allowing them to translocate to the nucleus and promote expression of HH-signaling
  target genes. In basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), inactivating PTCH1 mutations are
  most common (70–90%) followed by activating SMO mutations (10–20%). Created with
