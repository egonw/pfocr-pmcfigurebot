caption: Inflammation in the ischemic brain. (1) Antigen (Ag) released by damaged
  neurons is ingested and processed by dendritic cells (DCs), then stimulates T cell
  activation (take CD4+ T cells as an example, CD4 T cells are activated by MHC II–peptide–TCR
  and CD28-B7). Activated T cells secrete pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines
  to participate in the inflammatory response. (2) Neurons are exposed to new epitopes
  after necrosis, which can be recognized by natural immunoglobulin IgM in brain tissue,
  thereby activating the classical pathway of the complement system and forming a
  membrane attack complex (MAC) eventually. Then cellular contents are released extracellularly
  by MAC, which exacerbates the inflammatory response. (3) Injured neurons release
  DAMPs to activate microglia and participate in the inflammatory response. (4) Chemokines
  secreted by microglia and other inflammatory cells promote peripheral phagocytes,
  neutrophils, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, and γδT cells to migrate toward CNS.
