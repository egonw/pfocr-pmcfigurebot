figure_title: The Ask1 MAPK pathway functions downstream of dSarm1 to regulate NMJ
  growth, but not axonal injury
caption: 'A, Overexpression of dSarm1CE (isoform E-3kb) results in robust overgrowth
  at the NMJ. Overgrowth is suppressed by expression of either of two non-overlapping
  Ask1 RNAi transgenes or FosD/N. Expression of Ask1 RNAi or FosD/N do not lead to
  phenotypes on their own. Representative confocal images of muscle 4 synapses from
  third instar larva costained for presynaptic DVGLUT (green) and neuronal HRP (Red).
  Genotypes of the progeny are listed: UAS-Ask1RNAi #1 = KK110228, UAS-Ask1RNAi #2
  = 35331, UAS-WndRNAi = 103410, UAS-LexARNAi = 67947, UAS-dSarm1RNAi = KK105369.
  Quantification of the bouton number from motoneuron MN4b on muscle 4 of male progeny
  (17.6, 22.9, 60.8, 19.8, 16.6, 16.4, 65.6, 19.2, 16.5, 17.1, respectively). For
  Fig 3A-C, values are presented as mean +/- SEM. Statistics were obtained by performing
  a one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparisons for genotypes. (****p<0.0001).
  (n = 23, 27, 22, 30, 25, 34, 28, 36, 30, 31). B, The Jnk phosphatase puckered (puc)
  is a transcriptional readout of the Jnk signaling pathway. Neuronal expression (BG380-gal4)
  of dSarm1CE (isoform E-3kb) in neurons results in a 3.5-fold increase in puc-lacZ
  expression in neurons along the dorsal midline of the ventral nerve cord compared
  with WT controls. There is no increase in puc-LacZ levels in the double mutant,
  dSarm1CE+ED demonstrating a requirement for the NADase activiy of dSarm1. Furthermore,
  knockdown of Ask1 leads to full suppression of the increase in puc-lacZ expression.
  Quantification of puc-lacZ levels normalized from male progeny (1.00, 3.53, 1.01,
  0.97, 1.20, respectively). (****p<0.0001). (n = 7, 5,5,7,7) C., The segmental nerves
  of third instar larva are stained by HRP (red) and single axons are labeled by the
  expression of UAS-mCD8:GFP by the M12-Gal4 driver. In wild-type larva, axons distal
  to the crush site are extensively fragmented by 18 h after injury as seen by fragmentation
  of the GFP-labeled axon. Knockdown of dSarm1 results in pronounced axonal protection
  (****p<0.0001) in distal axons after injury. Conversely, knockdown of Ask1 shows
  no axonal protection. Axons from female progeny were scored by researcher blind
  to genotype using a scale ranging from completely continuous (0%), to continuous
  with varicosities (25%), to partially discontinuous (50%), to mostly fragmented
  with a few segments of continuity (75%), to completely fragmented (100%) []. (n
  = 9, 18, 18,11).'
