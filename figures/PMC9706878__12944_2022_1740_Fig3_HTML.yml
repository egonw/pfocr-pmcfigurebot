caption: 'In vivo overexpression of circLDLR alleviates the NAFLD development through
  the autophagy signaling pathway activation. HFD-induced mice were treated with circLDLR
  overexpression plasmid and then injected with or without 3-MA, A the circLDLR expression
  in liver tissues of NAFLD mice was quantified via qRT-PCR. *P < 0.05 vs. Vector
  group; #P < 0.05 vs. circLDLR OE group. B and C An enzymatic method was performed
  to measure the contents of TG and TC from liver tissues. *P < 0.05 vs. Vector group,
  #P < 0.05 vs. circLDLR OE group. D The effects of in vivo overexpression of circLDLR
  were investigated through ORO staining and TEM analysis on the liver histology of
  NAFLD mice. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. Vector group. E LC3 and p62 expressions in
  the livers of NAFLD mice were examined using western blot and relative quantification.
  ***P < 0.001 vs. Vector group; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 vs. circLDLR OE group'
