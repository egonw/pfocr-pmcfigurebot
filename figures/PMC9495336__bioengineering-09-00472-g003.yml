caption: Hepatoprotective action of fucoidan. Fucoidan increases the levels of glutathione
  peroxidase-4, glutathione and hepcidin; ameliorates alcohol-induced ferroptosis
  damage in the liver by up-regulation of p62/Keap1/Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway; activates
  SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway in non-alcoholic liver disease. (Green arrows
  indicate increase in synthesis or up-regulation of gene expression). Glutathione
  peroxidase and glutathione scavenge free radicals. Hepcidin reduces iron absorption
  through ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of divalent metal transporter-1
  (DMT1); p62 recruits ubiquitinated Keap1 proteins to autophagosomes and promotes
  expression of Nrf2; Nrf2 promotes downstream gene transcription of SLC7A11; SLC7A11
  is a transmembrane protein responsible for the cystine/glutamate antiporter to import
  cystine for glutathione biosynthesis and antioxidant defense. Fucoidan activates
  SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway which reduces lipotoxicity-related oxidative
  stress and inflammation. Fucoidan reduces ROS in hepatocytes; reduces the levels
  of malondialdehyde, divalent metal transporter-1 and ferroportin-1 to prevent iron
  overload. (Red arrows indicate decrease in synthesis or activity).
