caption: StnCBP exhibits strong and weak interactions with HC-ProO and HC-ProN, respectively,
  in the split luciferase complementation assays in N. benthamiana. a Luminescence
  image of the interaction between StnCBP and HC-ProO. b Luminescence image of the
  interaction between StnCBP and HC-ProN. c, d, and e StnCBP exhibited strong and
  weak interactions with HC-ProO and HC-ProN, respectively, under the same protein
  abundance. In a, b, and c, the luminescence images were captured using a CCD imaging
  system, and the pseudocolor bar shows the range of luminescence intensity. The reported
  interacting proteins StPHYF and StPHYB were used as the positive controls []. In
  d, the quantification of relative luciferase activity in leaves is equivalent to
  luminescence intensity/50 mm2 leaf area, which was calculated using IndiGO imaging
  software. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of three replicates (n = 3). Asterisks
  indicate statistically significant differences according to Student’s t test (**P < 0.01).
  In e, Western blotting showed the protein abundance of NLuc and CLuc fusions.
