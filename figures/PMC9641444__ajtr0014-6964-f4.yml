caption: 'Restoration of DNMT3b inhibits migration and invasion of LUSC cells. A:
  The expression of SPAG6 following the transfection of overexpression vectors containing
  SPAG6 in LUSC cells by RT-qPCR. B: Effect of overexpression of SPAG6 on cell proliferation
  by CCK8 assays. C: Effect of overexpression of SPAG6 on cellular DNA synthesis by
  EdU staining. D: Effect of overexpression of SPAG6 on the ability of cells to migrate
  by Transwell assay. E: Effect of overexpression of SPAG6 on the ability of cells
  to invade by Transwell assay. Data represent mean Â± SD from three independent experiments
  and were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (A-E) (*P < 0.05). SPAG6, Sperm Associated
  Antigen 6; LUSC, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.'
