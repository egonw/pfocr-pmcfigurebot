caption: (A) Pathway activation strength for pathways related to growth factor signaling.
  Pathways were clustered using Ward’s clustering method. (B) Relative mRNA levels
  for growth factor receptor genes measured by real-time PCR six days after lentiviral
  shRNA transduction of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells. Each gene expression for each sample
  was normalized to GAPDH expression. (C) Number of viable cells measured for 15 days
  after SH-SY5Y transduction with KIT-specific shRNAs in the presence of recombinant
  growth factors. Recombinant growth factors (100 ng/mL) were added on day 3 after
  lentiviral transduction, then on day 6, growth medium was changed and growth factors
  were added in the same concentrations, and this process was repeated on days 9 and
  12. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a control mock treatment, as it was used
  for protein stabilization. (D) Percentage of apoptotic cells measured six days after
  transduction. EPO and NGF (100 ng/mL) were added on the third day after transduction.
  Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using annexin-V and SYTOX-blue staining.
  (E) Number of viable cells and percentage of apoptotic cells six days after SH-SY5Y
  transduction with shKIT lenviral vector in the presence of EPO and NGF and ERK1/2
  inhibitor FR180204 (ERKi). EPO and NGF (100 ng/mL) and FR180204 (5 μM) were added
  on the third day after transduction. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 as determined by two-tailed
  t-test for PCR experiments, and by Mann–Whitney test for other experiments.
