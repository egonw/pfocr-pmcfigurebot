caption: Interplay of mTOR signaling through protein translation. (A) The mTOR signal
  either goes through the 4eBP bound to eIF4e or through the S6K. mTOR phosphorylation
  of 4E-BP triggers the release of eIF4e and activates translation initiation. Upregulation
  of eIF4e triggers direct or Ras-induced VEGF translation. Activation of S6K leads
  to phosphorylation of eIF4b, which increases the binding affinity to eIF3a and thus
  promotes the translation of IRES dependent proteins such as myc. Myc in turn promotes
  the expression of eIF4e at the transcriptional level. S6K can affect the change
  of elongation. eEF2K is a negative regulator of eEF2, giving mTORC1 the ability
  to promote translation elongation through S6K. (B) Akt is a downstream molecule
  of eEF2, which regulates its activity. On the one hand, Akt activates the mTOR signaling
  pathway by inactivating the upstream regulator of mTOR, TSC2. On the other hand,
  Akt mediated eEF2 promotes G2/M progression through CDC2 activation.
