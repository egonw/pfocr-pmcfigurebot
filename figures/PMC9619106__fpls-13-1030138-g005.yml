caption: Correlation maps related to the proline contents, the expression levels of
  the structural DEGs and the TF-hub genes. (A) The correlations between the proline
  contents and the expression levels of the 13 structural DEGs in the proline metabolic
  pathway and the expression levels of the 13 TF-hub genes. (B) The correlations among
  the expression levels of the 12 structural DEGs in the proline metabolic pathway
  and between the expression levels of the 7 TF-hub genes and the 12 structural DEGs
  in the proline metabolic pathway. The lines correspond to the expression correlations
  between the 7 TF-hub genes and the 12 structural DEGs. The colors of the lines represent
  the Mantel’s p, and the thicknesses of the lines represent the percentage of the
  Mantel’s r. The intensity of the blue color and the size of the box indicate the
  degree of the expression correlation among the 12 structural DEGs.
