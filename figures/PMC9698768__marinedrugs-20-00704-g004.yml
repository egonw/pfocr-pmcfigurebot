caption: 'Effects of LJP-1 on the expression of proteins involved in the MAPK and
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in tumor cells (H22 cells). After LJP-1 treatments,
  H22 cells were lysed and quantitated, and equal protein concentrations were subjected
  to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. β-actin was used as a protein loading
  control. (A) Western blot of H22 cells treated with LJP-1 expressing proteins in
  the PI3K/AKT pathway: p-Akt, PI3K, and ASK1 and β-actin. (B) Western blot of the
  expression of p-p38, p38, p-JNK, JNK, and β-actin. The blots were quantified using
  ImageJ software. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group.'
