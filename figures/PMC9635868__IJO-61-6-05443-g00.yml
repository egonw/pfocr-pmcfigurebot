caption: PPP1R14D is overexpressed in LUAD and is associated with poor prognosis.
  (A) GEPIA dataset analysis revealed that the expression of PPP1R14D in LUAD was
  significantly higher than that in normal lung tissue. Student's t-test, *P<0.05.
  (B) H&E staining to verify (a) LUAD tissue and paired (b) normal lung tissue (scale
  bar, 100 µm). (C) PPP1R14D expression in LUAD and normal lung tissue, as detected
  by immunohistochemical staining (scale bar, 100 µm); a, Positive PPP1R14D staining
  in LUAD tissue; b, Negative PPP1R14D staining in LUAD tissue; c, Positive PPP1R14D
  staining in normal lung tissue and d, Negative PPP1R14D staining in normal lung
  tissue. (D) Kaplan-Meier plotter database predicted the survival rates of LUAD patients
  with high and low PPP1R14D expression; a, overall survival; b, progression-free
  survival. PPP1R14D, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14D; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma;
  HR, hazard ratio.

  adenocarcinoma via the PKCα/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
