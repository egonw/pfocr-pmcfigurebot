caption: Proposed scheme for transcriptional regulation engineering and etoposide-related
  heterologous products. (A) Proposed transcriptional regulation engineering to divert
  native metabolism for high-value heterologous product biosynthesis. The red arrow
  represents activation, black arrows represent the native metabolic pathway, and
  blue arrows represent the heterologous pathway. (B–D) Chemical structures of desired
  heterologous products and other N. benthamiana endogenous metabolites and metabolic
  products. O-Glycosylation on C7 is a synthetic modification of EA to produce etoposide,
  while undesired 4′-O-glycosylation (shown in panel C) results from native metabolism
  in N. benthamiana.
