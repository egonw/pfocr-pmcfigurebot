caption: Identification of therapeutic targets and related chemicals of the formulas.
  (a) GO pathway enrichment analysis based on reported targets of chemicals derived
  from QLY and XYQLY; (b) the interactions among chemicals and LPS response-related
  genes; and (c) LPS signaling-related compounds within the formulas detected by LC-MS
  analysis. The 4 subfigures represent compounds closely related to the regulation
  of the LPS signaling pathway, namely, formononetin, benzoylpaeoniflorin, paeoniflorin,
  and paeoniflorin. Red arrows indicate compounds closely related to the regulation
  of LPS.
