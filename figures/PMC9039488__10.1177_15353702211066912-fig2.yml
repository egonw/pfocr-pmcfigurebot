caption: Antioxidant enzyme activity response to CDDO treatment. (a) Glutathione (GSH)
  levels and (b) NQO1 activity in macrophage cells differentiated from ML-1 monocytes
  in response to 24-h CDDO-IM treatment. CDDO-IM concentrations ranged from 100 to
  800 nM (data represent mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05 vs control). The differences between
  treatments were measured by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s
  post hoc test.
