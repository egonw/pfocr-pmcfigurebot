caption: Biochemical model of Imd pathway activation in D. melanogaster cells as a
  response to Gram-negative (G-) infection. The observed gene expression change corresponding
  to the experiment conditions and mutants is shown in blue (upregulation) or red
  (downregulation). With orange-filled or orange-bordered squares we indicate that
  the pinpointed gene significantly varies its expression in infected and, respectively,
  uninfected γCOP14a/γCOP14a males. With green-filled or green-bordered triangles
  we indicate the genes that significantly vary their expression in infected and,
  respectively, uninfected γCOPS057302/TM6B males. Unmarked components of the pathway
  did not show any statistically significant expression change. Created with BioRender.com
