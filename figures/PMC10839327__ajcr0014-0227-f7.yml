caption: Anti-cancerous and pro-cancerous immune cell correlation with EIF4EBP1 expression
  in breast cancer tumors, and cytolytic (CYT) scores. Box plots are based on the
  xCell algorithm for the TCGA, METABRIC, and SCAN-B cohorts. EIF4EBP1 expression
  is dichotomized into low and high groups by the median. The bolded center bar within
  the boxplots represents the median, the lower and upper box bounds represent the
  25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the lower and upper tails represent
  the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
article_title: High EIF4EBP1 expression reflects mTOR pathway activity and cancer
  cell proliferation and is a biomarker for poor breast cancer prognosis.
