figure_title: UHMK1 was involved in the regulation of JAK/STAT3 pathway
caption: 'A Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed in HCT116/shUHMK1 and RKO/shUHMK1
  cells with seven typical signaling pathway reporter systems as indicated. B Dual-luciferase
  reporter assay for JAK/STAT3 pathway in HCT116/shUHMK1 and RKO/shUHMK1 cells after
  IL-6 treatment. C Dual-luciferase reporter assay for JAK/STAT3 pathway in DLD-1/UHMK1-1
  and DLD-1/UHMK1-2 cells after IL-6 treatment. D Relative mRNA expression of c-MYC,
  Cyclin D1, BCL2, and MCL1 in DLD-1/UHMK1 and SW620/UHMK1 cells by RT-qPCR. E Western
  blot results of UHMK1, Cyclin D1, and c-MYC expression in DLD-1/UHMK1 and SW620/UHMK1
  cells. F GSEA analysis comparing the gene sets of JAK/STAT pathway with UHMK1 expression.
  Data were obtained from TCGA database. G Co-IP assays were performed in DLD-1/UHMK1-2
  cells transiently transfected with HA-STAT3 plasmid. Exogenous UHMK1 was immunoprecipitated
  with the anti-HA antibody. H Endogenous STAT3 was pulled down with anti-FLAG antibody
  in DLD-1/UHMK1-2 cells via Co-IP analysis. I Endogenous UHMK1 was coimmunoprecipitated
  with anti-STAT3 antibody in DLD-1 cells. J Co-localization of both UHMK1 (red) and
  STAT3 (green) in DLD-1/UHMK1-2 cells was shown. Scale bar: 30 μm. K Results of ChIP
  assay conducted using chromatins isolated from RKO cells with UHMK1 knockdown and
  control cells. The immunoprecipitated DNA by anti-STAT3 antibody was analyzed by
  agarose gel electrophoresis. Normal IgG was used as a negative control. *p < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01.'
