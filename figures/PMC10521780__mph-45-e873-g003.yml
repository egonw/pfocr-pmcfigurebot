caption: The altered signaling pathway in CD34+ cells of normal and MDS patients in
  PU.1/Spi1 (A), HSF1 (B), and (C) CSN5 mRNA levels was detected by real-time PCR.
  And GAPDH was used as the loading control. (D) The protein expression of PU.1/Spi1,
  HSF1 and CSN5 and STAT3 phosphorylation levels in whole cell lysates of CD34+ cells
  of normal and MDS patients. E–G, β-actin was used as the loading control for the
  whole cell lysate. Densitometry represents the expression of the proteins relative
  to β-actin. H, the level of phosphorylated STAT3 was significantly decreased in
  MDS patients. I, ChIP assay shows HSF1 binding to PU.1/Spi1 promoter. The ChIP ratio
  of PU.1/Spi1 relative to input. J, The binding of STAT3 to CSN5 promoters was measured
  with dual luciferase report gene assay. K, The results obtained by coimmunoprecipitation,
  and HSF1 ubiquitination levels were measured with western blot assay. Densitometry
  represents the expression of the proteins relative to input. All data are shown
  as mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.
