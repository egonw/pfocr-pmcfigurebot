caption: Immune infiltration and tumor microenvironment correlated with tRDFs(A) Bar
  plot shows the correlation between tRDFs and TIME cell infiltration evaluated by
  Pearson correlation. The length of column indicates the correlation; immune cells
  were selected from the mutual correlation with 5ʹ-tRDFs and 3ʹ-tRDFs. (B) Kaplan-Meier
  curves show overall survival of plasma cells that correlated with prognostic tRDFs.
  Red color indicates the high abundance of plasma cells, and blue color indicates
  the low abundance of plasma cells. (C) Network shows the tRDF-targeted immune-related
  signaling pathways in TCGA-LUAD cohort, including primary immunodeficiency, viral
  protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor, cytokine-cytokine receptor
  interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, T cell receptor signaling pathway, and
  the other signaling pathway. IgA, immunoglobulin A. (D) The correlation between
  tRDF with immune checkpoint CD274 (PD-L1), CTLA4, CD80, and CD86.
