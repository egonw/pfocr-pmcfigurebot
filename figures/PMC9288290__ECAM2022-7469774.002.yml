caption: 'ASP upregulated miR-373-3p and inhibited the TGF-β/Smad4 pathway. (a) The
  expression of miR-373-3p was detected by RT-qPCR; (b) the protein expressions of
  TGF-β and Smad4 were detected by western blotting. U251 cells were treated with
  different concentrations of ASP (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL) for 48 h; ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control; #P < 0.05, ###P < 0.001 vs. 0.1 mg/mL ASP; &&&P < 0.001
  vs. 0.2 mg/mL ASP. miR-373-3p knockdown weakens the antitumor activities of ASP
  in glioma cells.'
