caption: Cyanidin‐3‐galactoside (C3G) inhibits transforming growth factor‐β1 (TGF‐β1)/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling via the nuclear factor erythroid‐2‐related
  factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1) pathway. Western blot analysis was used
  to determine protein expression in different groups. (A, B) Protein expression of
  NRF2. (C, D) Protein expression of HO‐1. Protein expression was normalized to that
  of β‐actin. Results are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Different lowercase
  letters indicate statistical differences (p < .05)
article_title: Cyanidin‐3‐galactoside from Aronia melanocarpa ameliorates silica‐induced
  pulmonary fibrosis by modulating the TGF‐β/mTOR and NRF2/HO‐1 pathways.
