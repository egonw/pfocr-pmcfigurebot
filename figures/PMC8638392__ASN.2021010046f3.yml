caption: Hypoxia activates the HIF signaling pathway and decreases sodium transport
  via ENaC subunits downregulation in cultured mouse CCD principal cells. (A) Western
  blot analysis showing that increased HIF1α protein abundance induced by hypoxia
  correlates with decreased α-, β-, and γENaC abundance. The Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit
  abundance was not significantly changed. β-actin was used as a loading control.
  A representative experiment from three is shown. (B and C) Western blots were quantified
  using ImageJ software. Results are expressed as a percentage of control values (dots)
  and are means±SEM (lines) from three experiments in each group. (D) Monitoring of
  the transepithelial current in mpkCCDcl4 cells exposed or not to hypoxia (1% O2)
  for 3, 6, and 12 hours. Results shown are means±SEM from four independent experiments.
  (E) Real-time PCR analysis under the same conditions revealed that hypoxia induced
  a downregulation of mRNA levels of ENaC subunits and Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. (F)
  HIF pathway activation was confirmed by increased mRNA levels of the HIF target
  genes PDK1 and PGK1, assessed by real-time PCR. Results are expressed as fold of
  control (dots) and are means±SEM (lines) from three independent experiments in (C)
  and (D). Unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare data from (C) and (D). One-way
  ANOVA was used to compare data from (B), (E), and (F). *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001;
  ****P<0.0001, versus control.
