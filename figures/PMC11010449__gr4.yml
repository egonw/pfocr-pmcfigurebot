caption: 'Deoxynyboquinone (DNQ) activated the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1
  (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response
  elements (ARE) signal pathway in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 cells. (A) DNQ increased the stabilization and nucleus translocation
  of Nrf2. RAW264.7 cells were treated with DNQ with or without of LPS for 6 h, then
  the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining (blue, DAPI; red, Nrf2).
  (B) DNQ induced the high expression of ARE reporter in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells
  were transfected with ARE reporter, then incubated with DNQ for 24 h, following
  by dual luciferase assay with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (n = 3). (C)
  DNQ induced genes expression in Nrf2 downstream. RAW264.7 cells were treated with
  DNQ for 6 h in the presence or absence of LPS, then the mRNA expression of genes
  (Hmox1, Nqo1, Gclm, and Pdg) in cells were detected by quantitative polymerase chain
  reaction (qPCR) (n = 5). (D,E) DNQ induced the decrease of Keap1 and increase of
  Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and GCLM in RAW264.7 cells in a time- (D) and dose-dependent
  (E) manner. $P < 0.05, $$P < 0.01 and $$$P < 0.001 vs. Ctrl group. Ctrl: control;
  DAPI: 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.'
