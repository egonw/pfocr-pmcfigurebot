caption: Potential pathways by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) can infect the olfactory bulbs and generate inflammation. (A) Paracellular
  migration; molecules or virions can be transported across the cribriform plate through
  intercellular gaps between the olfactory ensheathing cells or within empty nerve
  fascicles. (B) Sterile neuroinflammation; immunological response marked by proinflammatory
  mediators (i.e., cytokines and chemokines) that are activated by the virus, which
  has an initiating but secondary role. (C) The transcellular (trans‐synaptic) transport
  pathway; virions could be transferred across the cribriform plate through anterograde
  synaptic transport. Reproduced from Xydakis et al., with permission.
