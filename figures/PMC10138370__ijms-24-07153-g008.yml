caption: Dietary N reduction leads to depletion of EAA (1), which results in activation
  of the GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway (2) and the induction of FGF21 (3). Increased expression
  of ATF4-related genes leads to an increase in NEAA (4). Dietary P reduction leads
  to reduced protein synthesis via reduced availability of ATP (5). EAA are not reduced
  with simultaneous N reduction (6) and prevent the signaling pathway from being initiated
  (7).
