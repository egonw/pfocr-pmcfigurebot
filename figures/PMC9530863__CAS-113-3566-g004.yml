caption: LRFN2 inhibits ESCC proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro. (A)
  Infection of ESCC TE1 and KYSE30 cells with lentiviral vector pLVX‐IRES‐Puro‐3xHA‐LRFN2
  (pLVX‐LRFN2). The efficiency of LRFN2 overexpression in TE1 and KYSE30 cells was
  determined via western blot. (B) LRFN2 inhibited the proliferation of ESCC TE1 and
  KYSE30 cells. (C, D) The number of colonies formed by TE1 and KYSE30 overexpressing
  LRFN2 was reduced compared with the control group. (E, F) Effects of stable overexpression
  of LRFN2 on invasion and migration of TE1 and KYSE30 cells. The invasion and migration
  ability of ESCC cells was inhibited. (G) Knockdown of LRFN2 expression in KYSE30
  using siRNA. The efficiency of LRFN2 low expression in KYSE150 cells was determined
  via western blot. (H) After downregulation of the expression of LRFN2, the growth
  rate of KYSE150 was faster than that of the control group. (I) The number of colonies
  formed by KYSE150 knockdown LRFN2 was reduced compared with the control group. (J)
  Knockdown of LRFN2 in KYSE150 cells produced an enhanced invasion and migration
  ability compared with the control group. (K) Western blotting was used to detect
  EMT‐related protein levels. In TE1, KYSE30, and KYSE150 cells, overexpression of
  LRFN2 resulted in upregulation of E‐cadherin expression, but downregulation of vimentin
  and N‐cadherin expression. After knocking down LRFN2 expression, the opposite result
  was obtained. *p < 0.05.
