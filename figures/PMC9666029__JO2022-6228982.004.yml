caption: Knockdown of LINC01279 inhibited the invasion and migration of gastric cancer
  cells. (a) Transwell assay detected the LINC01279 knockdown effect on the invasion
  and migration of gastric cancer SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells; (b, c) Fluorescence
  quantitative PCR was used to detected the expression of key proteins in the process
  of cell invasion and migration. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
