figure_title: The expression of circ-Pank1 significantly increased in PD model mice
  treated with rotenone and downregulation of circ-Pank1 in the MN9D cell model alleviates
  the damage to dopaminergic neurons
caption: A qRT–PCR was used to detect the expression of mmu_circ_32463, mmu_circ_34132,
  mmu_circ_34106, and mmu_circ_015216 in the SN of PD model mice treated with rotenone
  (n = 4). B Schematic diagram of ring formation of circ-Pank1. C Sublocalization
  of circ-Pank1 in MN9D cell. Taking U6 in the nucleus and 18S in the cytoplasm as
  the controls, most circ-Pank1 in MN9D cells was located in the cytoplasm; scale
  bars, 50 μm. D–G After si-circ-Pank1 and the corresponding control were transferred
  into the MN9D cell model treated with rotenone (n = 3). D qRT–PCR was used to detect
  the expression of circ-Pank1. E CCK-8 was used to detect the cell viability. F,
  G Western blot analysis of the TH protein levels. Data are presented as mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
