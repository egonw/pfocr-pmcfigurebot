caption: DNA damage repair blockade stimulates innate antitumor immunity via the cGAS-STING
  pathway. Upon DNA damage, DNA repair proteins are recruited to DNA damage sites
  for DNA repair. Inhibition of components of the repair pathway leads to cell-cycle
  checkpoint abrogation and inappropriate mitotic entry, and ultimately, induces mitotic
  catastrophe. In addition to being cytotoxic, DDR inhibitors exhibit antitumor immunity.
  PARPi, ATRi, or CHK1i-induced DSBs generate cytosolic dsDNA fragments, which activate
  the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway to initiate the IFN-γ response. This innate
  immune response upregulates chemokines, such like CCL5 or CXCL10, to enhance T cell
  recruitment. Moreover, PD-L1 expression is upregulated by IFN-γ that may lead to
  T cell exhaustion, an effect that can be abrogated using PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies.
