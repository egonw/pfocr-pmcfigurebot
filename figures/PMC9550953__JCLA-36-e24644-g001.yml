caption: CircPPP1R12A knockdown reduced the proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells.
  (A) RT‐PCR was used to detect the expression of circPPP1R12A in A549 and H1299 cells
  transfected with si‐control or si‐circPPP1P12A. (B) CCK‐8 assay was used to confirm
  A549 and H1299 cell viability after si‐control or si‐circPPP1R12A transfection.
  (C) The apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells was determined by TUNEL assay. (D) Transwell
  assay was used to confirm A549 and H1299 cell invasion after si‐control or si‐circPPP1R12A
  transfection. (E) Wound healing assay was used to determine the migration of A549
  and H1299 cells after si‐control or si‐circPPP1R12A transfection.
article_title: A peptide translated from circPPP1R12A promotes the malignancy of non‐small
  cell lung cancer cells through AKT signaling pathway.
