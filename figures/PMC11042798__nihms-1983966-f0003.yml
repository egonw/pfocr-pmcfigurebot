figure_title: Molecular responses to WNT5A-ROR signaling
caption: Several downstream targets of WNT5A-ROR signaling have recently been identified,
  enabling molecular examination of the WNT5A-ROR signaling pathway. (A) Western blot
  analysis of Wnt5a knockout MEFs stimulated with recombinant WNT5A. WNT5A induces
  the phosphorylation of DVL2, ROR1 and ROR2 (P-DVL2, P-ROR1, P-ROR2), as well as
  the degradation of Kif26b and Pdzrn3 (; ; ). (B) Combined genetic deletion of Ror1
  and Ror2 results in reduction of DVL2 phosphorylation, as well as stabilization
  of Kif26b and Pdzrn3 (; ; ). Genenetic deletion of Ror1 and Ror2 was achieved by
  treating MEFs carrying Ror1 and Ror2 conditional (f/f) alleles as well as a transgene
  encoding the tamoxifen-inducible CRE-ER, with the tamoxifen analog 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen
  (4-OHT). (C) WNT5A-ROR signaling can also be quantitatively assayed by monitoring
  the fluorescence of a GFP-Pdzrn3 degradation reporter via flow cytometry (). Histograms
  of a representative flow cytometry experiment showing the fluorescence decrease
  in MEFs expressing the GFP-Pdzrn3 reporter following WNT5A stimulation. (D) Dose-response
  curve showing GFP-Pdzrn3 degradation as a function of WNT5A concentration ().
