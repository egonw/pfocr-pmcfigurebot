caption: Photoreceptor-directed temporal response characteristics in mesopic and photopic
  lighting(A) Amplitude sensitivity (mean ± SEM, n = 3 observers) as a function of
  temporal frequency (symbols) is described by best-fitting difference of Gaussians
  models (curved lines) at mesopic (200 Td, filled symbols, solid lines) and photopic
  illumination (2000 Td, unfilled symbols, dashed lines). Temporal sensitivity is
  low pass for melanopsin-directed (green triangles) and band-pass for both rod-directed
  (black squares) and LMS-cone-directed stimuli (gray circles). Arrows denote the
  instrument gamut for each condition.(B) Melanopsin-mediated visual function (green
  line from (A)) is enhanced with subthreshold, supplemental rod contrast (magenta
  symbols and lines; + 0.5% Michelson rod contrast, circles; + 2%, squares; + 3%,
  triangles).(C) Rod-mediated visual function shifts toward the cone sensitivity function
  with supplemental cone contrast (blue symbols and lines; + 0.5% Michelson LMS cone
  contrast, circles; + 1%, squares; + 2%, triangles; + 3%, inverted triangles; + 4%,
  diamonds).(D and F) Application of temporal white noise desensitizes the cone intrusions
  at higher frequencies in melanopsin-directed stimuli. The change (Δ log CS) in melanopsin-directed
  or rod-directed contrast sensitivity indicates that (E) supplemental rod-contrast
  or (F) cone-contrast in the stimuli can facilitate temporal sensitivity at frequencies
  >1 Hz.(G) The threshold versus intensity (TVI) response function for rod-directed
  stimuli (1 Hz, squares) is more sensitive than, and deviates from the classic  model
  at illuminations >498 Sc Td (200 Ph Td) (solid black line; −0.12 vertical adjustment
  to account for differences in spatiotemporal summation). In photopic illuminations,
  the rod-pathway has lower contrast sensitivity than the cone pathway (LMS; gray
  circles) but higher sensitivity than the melanopsin-pathway (i; green triangles).(H)
  The rod-directed critical flicker frequency (CFF) (black squares) is attenuated
  by illuminations >7470 Sc Td (3000 Ph Td). The cone CFF increases with light level
  according to the Ferry-Porter law (gray circles). Rod-cone interactions (Rod +3%
  supplemental LMS-cone contrast; blue diamonds) suppress the LMS-cone CFF to a level
  between the rod-directed and cone-directed maximum temporal resolution. The melanopsin
  CFF is invariant with changes in retinal illumination (green triangles).(I) The
  CFF of the three photoreceptor-directed (PRD) conditions increase with intrusion
  from supplemental photoreceptor contrast at two light levels (200 Td, darker lines
  and symbols; 2000 Td, lighter lines and symbols).
