caption: Enteric P.e. infection leads to upregulation of gut- and fat body-expressed
  lipid transport, TAG lipases, and beta-oxidation genes. a) KEGG pathway analysis
  of genes showing >1.5-fold increase following enteric infections. b) GO analysis
  (biological process categories) of genes showing >1.5-fold increase following enteric
  infections. c) Heatmap depicting the change in expression (Log2-fold change vs mock-infected
  flies) of lipid transport, TAG lipases, and beta-oxidation genes following enteric
  infection. Grey symbols show genes with strong enrichment in either the intestinal
  tissues or fat body, based on expression levels from FlyAtlas2. d, e) qPCR analysis
  of lipid transport, TAG lipases, and beta-oxidation genes from (d) isolated abdominal
  tissues or (e) intestines. Bars represent mean±SEM. Symbols represent individual
  data points, n = 6–10 per condition. *P < 0.05, Student’s t-test.
