caption: Parvimonas micra promotes colorectal cancer in APCMin/+ mice. A APCMin/+
  mice were administrated with P. micra or PBS for 12 weeks, and fecal collection
  was performed at the end of gavage. Blood was collected at the midpoint and endpoint
  of gavage. B Representative images of APCMin/+ mice colon. C Changes in tumor size,
  tumor number, and colon length in APCMin/+ mice. D Representative images of colon
  pathology. E Serum biochemical assay of APCMin/+ mice. F Serum cytokine detection
  in mice at midpoint (6 weeks). G Serum cytokine detection in mice at endpoint (12 weeks).
  H Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis of the gut microbiota with 16S
  rDNA sequencing. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 11
article_title: Parvimonas micra activates the Ras/ERK/c-Fos pathway by upregulating
  miR-218-5p to promote colorectal cancer progression.
