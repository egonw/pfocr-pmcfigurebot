caption: Atomoxetine therapy exerts normalizing effect on CSF Alzheimer’s disease
  biomarkers associated with synaptic, metabolic, and inflammatory pathophysiology.
  Longitudinal CSF samples collected from each of the 36 subjects at baseline, 6 months,
  and 12 months were analysed by tandem mass tagging-mass spectrometry and Alzheimer’s
  disease biomarker pathway panels were quantified. For each subject, abundance ratios
  before and after treatment with either placebo or atomoxetine therapy were calculated
  for each arm of the trial. The placebo effect measurements were derived from only
  the placebo/active arm of the trial due to concern that post-placebo responses in
  the active/placebo arm may be confounded by carryover effects from earlier atomoxetine
  (ATX) therapy. (A) Box plots demonstrating the log2-transformed ratio of pre- and
  post-treatment panel abundance levels (Z-score) following 6 months of either placebo
  or ATX therapy. A t-test analysis was used to identify panels with significantly
  different (P < 0.05) post-treatment responses to placebo and ATX. (B) Volcano plot
  displaying the log2-transformed difference in abundance ratio (x-axis) against the
  −log10 statistical P-value (y-axis) for all proteins demonstrating differential
  responses following 6 months of ATX therapy compared to placebo. Proteins belonging
  to biomarker pathway panels are represented by coloured data-points.
