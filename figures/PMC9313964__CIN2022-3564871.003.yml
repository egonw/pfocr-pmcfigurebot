caption: The expression levels of autophagy and KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathway-related
  proteins in PFC cells. (a) The expression level of LC3 was detected by RT-qPCR.
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. PFC + BLM group. (b) The expression level of Beclin 1 was detected
  by RT-qPCR. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. PFC + BLM group. (c) The expression level of p62 was
  detected by RT-qPCR. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. PFC + BLM group. (d) The expression levels of
  autophagy related proteins of LC3, Beclin 1, and p62 by Western blotting assay.
  ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. PFC + BLM group. (e) The expression level of KEAP1
  was detected by RT-qPCR. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. PFC + BLM group. (f) The expression level
  of Nrf2 was detected by RT-qPCR. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. PFC + BLM. The expression levels
  of KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathway-related proteins of KEAP1 and Nrf2 by Western blotting
  assay. ∗∗P < 0.01vs. PFC + BLM group.
