caption: The PDGFRβ pathway in pulmonary smooth muscle cells. Binding of PDGF to PDGFRβ
  and its subsequent autophosphorylation have been shown to trigger multiple signals
  in pulmonary smooth muscle cells. It activates the ras/Erk pathway promoting Cyclin
  D1 transcription, a major regulator of the cell cycle. The Akt/mTOR pathway was
  also demonstrated to induce STIM1 and Orai1 expression. The complex Orai1/STIM1
  is responsible for store-operated calcium entry into PASMC leading to contraction
  and proliferation. The PDGF pathway stimulates JAK and the STAT transcription factors
  leading to enhanced expression of NFATc2 and CaSR which are both pro-proliferative.
  CaSR also activates TRPC channels calcium entry which provokes contraction and proliferation.
  PDGF stimulation increases Foxo4 ubiquitination and degradation. Foxo4 is a transcription
  factor that downregulates Cyclin D1 expression, a process alleviated upon PDGF activation.
  PDGFRβ activity is enhanced by direct interaction with the serotonin transporter
  5-HTT which is increased during PAH. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; STIM1, stromal interaction
