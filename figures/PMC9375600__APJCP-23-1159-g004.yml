caption: Effect of miR-625 Overexpression on Cell Cycle in KG-1 Cells 48 hours Post
  Transfection. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle phase in (A) KG-1 cells were
  used as a control. (B) KG-1 cells transfected with pLentiIII-backbone-GFP construct.
  (C) KG-1cells transfected with pLentiIII-pre mir625-GFP. (D) Overexpression of miR-625
  in KG-1 cells demonstrated no significant change compared to backbone (Mean Â±SD,
  P > 0.05)
