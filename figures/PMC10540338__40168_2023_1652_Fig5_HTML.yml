caption: 'Difference in functional capacities of the rumen microbiome between HADG
  and LADG goats (n = 8 each group). A Differences in level 3 KEGG microbial pathways
  between HADG and LADG goats (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05). B Reconstruction
  of the metabolic pathway associated with VFA biosynthesis and methanogenesis. C
  Spearman’s rank correlations between the ADG-associated ASVs and the VFA-related
  KEGG pathways (p < 0.05). D Differential CAZyme functions between HADG and LADG
  goats based on family-level enzymes (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05) HADG: young
  goats with high average daily gain, LADG: young goats with low average daily gain'
article_title: Multi-omics revealed the long-term effect of ruminal keystone bacteria
  and the microbial metabolome on lactation performance in adult dairy goats.
