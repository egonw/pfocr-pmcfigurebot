caption: 'Effect of pinostrobin and H89 (PKA inhibitor) on PKA signaling pathway in
  B16F10 cells. Cells were pre−treated with H89 for 30 min prior to exposure to pinostrobin
  (100 μM) for 72 h to evaluate (a) the intracellular melanin contents, and (b) tyrosinase
  activity. (c–f) Cells were treated with H89 (10 μM) for 30 min, followed by treatment
  with pinostrobin (100 μM) for 24 h. Subsequently, tyrosinase, TRP 1, and MITF were
  analyzed by Western blotting. (g–j) Western blotting result of p-CREB, p-GSK-3β,
  and p-β-catenin expression with co-treatment of H89 and pinostrobin. Blots were
  quantified using ImageJ software. Protein levels were normalized to the corresponding
  loading controls. The untreated cells were regarded as 100%. Values are expressed
  represent as the mean±SD of three independent experiments. *** p < 0.001, ** p <
  0.01, and * p < 0.05 compared with control group; ### p < 0.001 and # p < 0.05 compared
  with pinostrobin group without H89.'
