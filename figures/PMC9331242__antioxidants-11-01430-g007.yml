caption: 'Butein activates the Nrf2-related signaling pathway in oxidative-stress-induced
  H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. (a) Western blot analysis for Nrf2 and lamin B1 (loading control)
  proteins using the nuclear fraction of cells treated with butein and/or H2O2. (b)
  The band density of Nrf2 protein was calculated with HD imaging software. The results
  are shown as the mean ± SEM in triplicate. (c) Immunofluorescence images of Nrf2
  protein (red fluorescence). The nucleus (blue fluorescence) was stained with DAPI.
  (d) The mRNA expression of Nrf2 target genes including NQO1, HMOX1, and GCLC was
  performed by qRT-PCR analysis in triplicate. ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 vs. control
  group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. H2O2-only group. Cont; control,
  Bu; butein. Scale bar, 100 μm.'
