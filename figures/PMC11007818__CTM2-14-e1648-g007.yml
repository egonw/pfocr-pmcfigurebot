caption: AD‐04 modulates HIF‐1α signaling pathway in hypoxia activated fibroblasts.
  (A) TP53 CRISPR/Cas9 knock‐out HDF cells were cultured under hypoxia and secreted
  VEGF levels were measured by ELISA in supernatants. TP53 knock‐out efficiency was
  confirmed by immuno‐blot. (B) HDF cells were treated under hypoxia for 6 h with
  either 1 µm AD‐04 or 1 µm Nutlin‐3a. (C) Schematic representation of genes differentially
  modulated by AD‐04 in activated HDFs but not in p53‐wild‐type cancer cells. Of these
  2212 genes, known USP7 interactors were identified. (D) HDF cells were treated with
  either 1 µm AD‐04, ent‐AD‐04 or Nutlin‐3a for 6 h and immunoblotted for UHRF1. A
  band correlating with 8 kDa increase in UHRF1 protein size correlated with ubiquitinylation
  was present in AD‐04‐treated HDFs but not in MDM2 antagonist (Nutlin)‐treated cells.
  (E) Co‐immunoprecipitation of UHRF1 and immunoblotting with UHRF1, USP7 and Ubiquitin
  in HDF cells. HDFs were treated with under hypoxia for 3 h followed by 1 µm, AD‐04,
  10 µm MG‐132 or DMSO. (F) Co‐immunoprecipitation of UHRF1 and immunoblotting with
  UHRF1 in HDF cells transfected with siRNA towards USP2 or USP21. HDF cells were
  treated with either DMSO or 1 µm AD‐04 for 4 h. (G) UHRF1 knock‐out HDF cells cultured
  under hypoxia and secreted VEGF levels were measured by ELISA in supernatants. UHRF1
  knock‐out efficiency was confirmed by immuno‐blot. (H) Network pathway ranking for
  genes differentially regulated by AD‐04 in HDFs under normoxia versus hypoxia; AD‐04
  modulates the HIF‐1α mRNA expression network (KEGG definition) in hypoxia‐activated
  fibroblasts. (I) HDF cells were treated with 300 nm AD‐04 under hypoxia for 6 and
  24 h, VEGF mRNA expression levels were measured by RT‐qPCR.
