caption: Effect of azilsartan on the in vivo tumor metastatic activity of MDA-MB-231/Luc
  cancer cells. (A) Bioluminescent images for lungs of animals injected with cancer
  cells untreated or pre-treated with azilsartan. (B) The bioluminescent intensities.
  Bars represent mean Â± SD, n = 6. Significant difference was analyzed by student
  t test, where *** p < 0.001, compared to intensities of the animals injected with
  untreated cells.
