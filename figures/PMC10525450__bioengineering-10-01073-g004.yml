caption: Evaluation of exogenous GGPP addition for total ketocarotenoid optimization
  in transfected HEK293T cells with Î²-carotene and astaxanthin biosynthetic genes.
  (A) Expression of EGFP and mCherry in HEK293T cells transfected with pPYLG + pWZG-P2A
  constructs and supplied with GGPP. (B) HPLC analysis of cells transfected with above-mentioned
  plasmids and supplied with GGPP. Can, canthaxanthin; Ast, astaxanthin; E, trans
  geometric isomer; and Z, cis geometric isomer. (C) Total ketocarotenoid concentration
  graph compared with the ratio of astaxanthin and canthaxanthin content. DW, dry
  weight. (D) Astaxanthin and canthaxanthin concentration graphs from cell extracts
  transfected with pPYLG + pWZG-P2A and supplied with exogenous GGPP. (E) The HEK293T
  cell pellets with a red hue reflect ketocarotenoid accumulation. (F) Pie charts
  outline total ketocarotenoids with different percentages of astaxanthin and canthaxanthin
  content.
