caption: Enrichment analysis of NOL7-related genes. (a) The top 100 genes related
  to NOL7 expression were obtained from the TCGA project, and the correlations between
  NOL7 expression and selected target genes, including MCUR1, EEF1E1, SSB, DHX9, WRNIP1,
  and ABT1, were analyzed using GEPIA2. (b) A PPI network of 50 experimentally verified
  NOL7-interacting proteins. The corresponding heatmap data for the detailed cancer
  types are shown below. (c) An intersection analysis of the NOL7-interacting and
  NOL7-correlated genes was conducted, and four genes were obtained, including NIFK,
  MPHOSPH10, NOL10, and WDR12. (d) KEGG pathway analysis of NOL7-interacting genes
  and NOL7-correlated genes. (e) GO analysis of NOL7-interacting genes and NOL7-correlated
  genes. Enrichment results for biological processes (left), cellular component (middle),
  and molecular functions (right) are displayed.
