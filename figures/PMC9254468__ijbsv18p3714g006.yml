caption: PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inactivation was ROS-dependent. (A) Circle plots
  from RNA-seq data revealed the relationship between enriched BP terms, including
  ROS related terms, and several essential genes involved in PI3K/AKT pathway. (B)
  The protein expression levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT and p-AKT in H460 and A549 after
  ISP-I (10μM, 48h) treatment with or without NAC (2 mM) by western blotting.
