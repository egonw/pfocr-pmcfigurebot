caption: GA inhibited the tumor growth and triggered pyroptosis of CRC cells in vivo.
  CT26 cells were inoculated into BALB/c mice to establish the murine xenograft model.
  (A) Change curves of mice weight after GA treatments (n = 6). (B) Tumor volume,
  (C) tumor weight, (D) photographs of isolated tumor after GA treatment. (E) Western
  blotting analyses of GSDME-FL and GSDME-N expression in treated tumor tissues. The
  whole western blots were shown in . (F) H&E staining and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry
  analysis of tumor tissues after GA treatments. (G) Quantitation of Ki-67 staining
  from immunohistochemical analysis. NS, not significant, * p < 0.05 vs. control,
  ** p < 0.01 vs. control.
