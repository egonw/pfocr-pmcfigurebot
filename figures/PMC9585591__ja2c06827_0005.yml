figure_title: Oxidative Metabolism of DHA (1) and Synthetic Strategy of Photoaffinity
  Probes 4 and 5
caption: (A) Metabolic pathway of DHA to 17-oxo-DHA, resolvins, and protectins. (B)
  Structures of photoaffinity-click (pac-)probes based on DHA (1) and 17-HDHA (2).
  The synthetic strategy included the use of soybean lipoxygenase (sLOX) to introduce
  the hydroxyl and the use of Wittig reactions to join building blocks 6, 8, and 9.
  COX, cyclooxygenase; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase;
  HDHA, hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid; LOX, lipoxygenase; P450, cytochrome P450; sHE,
  soluble epoxide hydrolase.
