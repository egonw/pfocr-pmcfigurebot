caption: '(A) Sections of cerebral cortex were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
  in the three groups (CON-G, DM-G and DMEX-G). Images of the brain section were magnified
  ×400. (B) The apoptotic cells of cerebral cortex in the three groups as stained
  with DAPI (top, blue spots) and TUNEL (bottom, green spots). (C) Percentage of TUNEL(+)
  cells relative to total cells are presented in bars. Data are expressed as mean
  ± SD (n = 3). ** p < 0.01 compared to CON-G, ## p < 0.01 compared to DM-G. CON-G,
  control group; DM-G, streptozotocin-induced diabetic group; DMEX-G, streptozotocin-induced
  diabetes with swimming exercise group.'
