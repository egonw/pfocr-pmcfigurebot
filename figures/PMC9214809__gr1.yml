caption: Effect of seladelpar on gene expression in vivo. Male WT C57BL/6 mice were
  gavaged with seladelpar (10 mg/kg body weight) and harvested after 6 h. A, serum
  C4. B–J, gene expression in the liver. K–N, gene expression in the ileum. O, Fgf15
  in mouse serum. Results of gene expression were obtained from two technical replicates.
  Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M., ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 denotes the significant
  difference between PBS and seladelpar.
