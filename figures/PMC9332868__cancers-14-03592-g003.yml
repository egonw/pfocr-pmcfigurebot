caption: 'Tegaserod maleate inhibits the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway in GC. (A)
  MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity was assessed by in vitro kinase assay using active
  MEK1, MEK2 and inactive ERK2 proteins. The effect of tegaserod maleate was determined
  using Western blotting. (B) The levels of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-RSK2 and T-RSK2 in
  HGC27 and AGS cells with different concentrations of tegaserod maleate (0, 0.25,
  0.5, 1 and 2 Î¼M) treatment for 24 h was determined by Western blotting. (C) The
  levels of p-ERK1/2 T202/Y204 were affected by MEK1 and MEK2 in HGC27 (C) and AGS
  (D) when treated with tegaserod maleate. ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated by MEK1/2
  and ERK1/2 was detected using p-ERK1/2 T202/Y204 (E) Immunofluorescence staining
  of HGC27 and AGS: cells were treated for 24 h, and then stained for p-ERK1/2 T202/Y204
  (100 magnifications). The asterisks (**) (***) indicate a significant (p < 0.01
  and 0.001).'
