figure_title: EREG acts as a potential factor for vaginal epithelial cell proliferation
  and differentiation
caption: 'A Heatmap of the expression levels of ErbB signaling pathway signature genes
  in the vagina of control and Rptor cKO mice in the presence or absence of E2 administration.
  B qPCR was performed to verify the genes in the frame in A. n = 7 (OVX control mice),
  n = 5 (OVX Rptor cKO mice), n = 6 (OVX control mice treated with E2), n = 5 (OVX
  Rptor cKO mice treated with E2). Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. C Representative
  images of the immunofluorescence staining of EREG in the vagina in OVX control and
  Rptor cKO mice administrated with or without E2. Nuclei were stained with DAPI.
  Microscopy with magnification ×20. Scale bars: 75 μm. D OVX control and Rptor cKO
  mice were administrated with E2 and/or EREG. The vaginas were harvested for PAS
  staining, Ki67 immunofluorescence staining, and TUNEL staining. In PAS staining,
  nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Scale bars: 50 μm. In Ki67 immunofluorescence
  staining and TUNEL staining, nuclei were stained with DAPI. Microscopy with magnification
  ×20. Scale bars: 75 μm. E Expression levels of Krt6a, Krt6b, Krt10, Krt13, Krt16
  in the vagina of the mice were quantified using qPCR. n = 6 (OVX control mice treated
  with E2), n = 5 (OVX Rptor cKO mice treated with E2), n = 4 (OVX Rptor cKO mice
  treated with E2 and EREG). Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. F The vaginas
  as indicated in D were harvested for immunofluorescence staining of YAP1, nuclei
  were stained with DAPI. n = 6 (OVX control mice treated with E2), n = 5 (OVX Rptor
  cKO mice treated with E2), n = 4 (OVX Rptor cKO mice treated with E2 and EREG).
  The experiments were repeated three times. Microscopy with magnification ×20. Scale
  bars: 75 μm.'
