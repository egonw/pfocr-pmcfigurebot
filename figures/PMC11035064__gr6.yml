caption: 'The integrated analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles following
  wedelolactone (WEL) and demethylwedelolactone (DWEL) treatment. (A) Single-sample
  gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of the key metabolic pathway across each sample.
  (B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of steroid biosynthesis and fatty acid elongation
  in WEL and DWEL treatment group vs. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) group.
  (C) The biological processes of steroid synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and glutathione
  metabolism, and the crucial genes involved. (D) The relative mRNA levels of genes
  in essential metabolic pathways determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
  Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) (n = 10). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P < 0.001,
  ns: no significance. NES: normalized enrichment score; FDR: false discovery rate;
  TAA: thioacetamide; farnesyl-PP: farnesyl pyrophosphate.'
