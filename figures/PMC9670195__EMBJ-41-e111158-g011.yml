  exocytic site in Toxoplasma gondii
caption: Immunofluorescence images of intracellular (upper panel) and extracellular
  (lower panel) tachyzoites co‐expressing TgCRMPa‐HA3 and TgNd6‐TY2. Extracellular
  parasites were incubated with host cell monolayers for 2 min prior to fixation.
  Parasites were stained with anti‐HA and anti‐TY Abs to label CRMPa and Nd6, respectively.
  Nd6, but not CRMPa, accumulates at the tachyzoite apex in intracellular parasites
  (arrowheads), while both proteins localize at the tip of the extruded conoid in
  extracellular parasites (arrows). DNA is labeled by Hoechst. Single focal planes
  are shown. DIC, differential interference contrast.Ultrastructure expansion microscopy
  of extracellular tachyzoites, either untagged or co‐expressing TgCRMPa‐HA3/TgCRMPa‐TY2
  and TgCRMPb‐HA3 together or in pairwise combination with TgNd6‐TY2. Parasites were
  treated with A23187 prior to fixation and preparation for U‐ExM, and stained with
  anti‐HA, anti‐TY, and anti‐α/β tubulin Abs to label CRMPs, Nd6/CRMPa, and microtubules,
  respectively. Shown are maximum‐intensity projections of z‐stack confocal images.
  CRMPs overlap with Nd6 at the tip of the extruded conoid (yellow selection). A magnified
  image of the apical tip of each parasite is shown on the right.The extent of co‐localization
  between TgCRMPa‐TY2 and TgCRMPb‐HA3, and TgCRMPs‐HA3 with TgNd6‐TY2 in the apical
  dot shown in B. Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured using the Fiji‐JACoP
  plugin. Values are expressed as mean ± SD. Three to five parasites per line were
  analyzed.Quantification of the dot pattern for TgCRMPa‐HA3 and TgCRMPb‐HA3 in TgNd9_iKD
  lines. CRMPs accumulation at the apical tip of extracellular parasites was measured
  as in Fig . TgCRMPs were still found in the apical dot in the absence of TgNd9 (+ATc).
  Numbers are expressed as the percentage of parasites showing (dot) or lacking (no
  dot) the tip accumulation of TgCRMPa and TgCRMPb. The number of parasites (n) analyzed
  for each line is reported at the top of the column.Immunofluorescence and DIC images
  of an extracellular parasite and parasites in early, middle, and late stages of
  host cell invasion. Parasites co‐expressing TgCRMPa‐HA3 and TgNd6‐TY2 were incubated
  with host cell monolayers and fixed after 2, 3, and 5 min. Parasites were immunostained
  with anti‐HA, anti‐TY, and anti‐RON5 Abs to label CRMPs, Nd6, and the moving junction,
  respectively. DNA is labeled by Hoechst. In contrast with TgNd6 (arrow), the apical
  accumulation of TgCRMPa observed in extracellular parasites (arrow) disappears upon
  entering the host, a step marked by the formation of the moving junction (arrowhead),
  and for the entire process. Non‐specific anti‐TY labeling of mitochondria was detected
  for both untagged and tagged lines (Fig ). Single focal planes are shown.Model depicting
  the proposed role for the TgCRMP complex in rhoptry exocytosis. Upon contacting
  the host cell via a host ligand, CRMPs participate in the activation of the signaling
  pathway targeting the AV‐RSA system and leading to the fusion events required for
  the timely discharge of rhoptry contents. Rh, rhoptry; AV, apical vesicle; RSA,
  rhoptry secretory apparatus.
