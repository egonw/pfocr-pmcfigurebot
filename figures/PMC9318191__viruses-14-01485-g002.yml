caption: PRRSV infection induces miR-150 expression via the PKC/JNK/c-Jun pathway.
  (A) PAMs were pretreated for 1 h with inhibitors of the PKC inhibitor (GF), JNK
  inhibitor (SP), TAK-1 inhibitor (5Z-7), NF-kB inhibitor (BAY), p38MAPK inhibitor
  (SB), PI3K inhibitor (LY), histone deacetylase inhibitor (TSA), DNA methyltransferase
  inhibitor (5-AZA), or DMSO control, and then inoculated with HP-PRRSV (HV isolate)
  (MOI = 1). At 36 hpi, miR-150 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. (B–D) PAMs were
  pretreated for 1 h with the PKC inhibitor (GF), JNK inhibitor (SP), and c-Jun inhibitor
  (SR11302, SR) at different doses, and then infected with HP-PRRSV (HV isolate) (MOI
  = 1). At 36 hpi, total RNAs were extracted for analyzing miR-150 and pri-miR-150
  expression by qRT-PCR. (E) PAMs were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor (GF) for
  1 h, followed by infection with HV-PRRSV (HV isolate) (MOI = 1), and cells were
  harvested at 24 hpi. Western blot was used to examine the expression levels of p-JNK,
  total-JNK, p-c-Jun, total-c-Jun, and β-actin. The data are representative of three
  independent experiments (means ± SEM). p values were analyzed using a t-test. *,
  p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.
