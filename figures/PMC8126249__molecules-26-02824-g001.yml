caption: JAK–STAT signaling pathway activated in response to cytokines. Binding of
  cytokines to their cognate receptors triggers the phosphorylation of JAK and its
  receptors. After that, recruited STAT is phosphorylated and translocated as homo-
  or heterodimers to the nucleus, where they upregulate the transcription of cytokine-responsive
  genes.
