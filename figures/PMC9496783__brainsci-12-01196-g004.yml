caption: Extraction and verification of the black module, based on the WGNCA results.
  (a) Dendrogram clustered based on a dissimilarity measure (1-TOM). The black module
  was identified as an AD microglial-related module. (b) Module-trait relationships
  of bulkRNA-seq data. Each row corresponds to a module eigengene, and each column
  to a trait. Each cell contains the corresponding correlation and p-value. Blue to
  red indicates a negative to positive correlation; the range is from −1 to 1. (c)
  Results of DO enrichment analysis of the black module, with the number of genes
  in the pathway on the horizontal axis and the list of pathways on the vertical axis,
  with the q-value (adjusted p-value) indicated in blue to red.
