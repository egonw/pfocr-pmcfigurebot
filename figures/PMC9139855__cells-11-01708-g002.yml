caption: 'Therapeutic target modulation of the AhR for inflammatory GI conditions
  by chemical modality. (A) Small molecule approaches for systemic or GI-selective
  targeting of the AhR. The labile AhR exists within a multiprotein complex (protein
  23 (p23), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and HBV X-associated protein-2 (XAP-2))
  in the cytosol and upon ligand binding within the ligand binding domain (LBD), the
  AhR complex translocates into the nucleus. AhR activation occurs when the receptor
  dissociates from its chaperone proteins, heterodimerizes with ARNT, and selectively
  binds to DNA at the dioxin response element (DRE) site. This process is followed
  by recruitment of co-activators, co-repressors, and/or enhancers to the AhR:ARNT:DRE
  complex upstream of a promoter and induction of AhR-dependent gene transcription
  (e.g., CYP1A1). (B) Microbial therapeutic approaches for AhR modulation. Microbial
  AhR ligands include: (B1) gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids, (B2) plant
  diet- and microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g., Trp), and (B3) LBP microbiota-derived
  metabolites. Microbial AhR ligands can activate the AhR similar to small molecules
  and mediate AhR-dependent inflammatory gene transcription (e.g., IL-22). (C) AhR
  modulation by PROTACs. Apart from activating the canonical DRE-driven pathway, an
  AhR agonist can potentially also serve as a PROTAC by forming an E3 ligase:AhR:substrate
  ternary complex to promote proteasomal degradation of target protein of interest
  (substrate). (D) Oligonucleotide-based approaches for AhR target modulation. (D1)
  Exosome-like nanoparticles (ELN) harbor miRNA that stimulate production of gut microbiota-derived
  AhR ligands to activate the AhR and mediate intestinal homeostasis. (D2) Specific
  miRNA (e.g., miR-124) can promote intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the AhR;
  however, targeted inhibition or degradation of pro-inflammatory miRs can potentiate
  AhR-dependent gut resiliency.'
