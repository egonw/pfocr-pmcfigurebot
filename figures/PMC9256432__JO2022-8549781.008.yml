caption: TNFRSF9 overexpression inhibited breast cancer cell-induced tumor formation.
  (a) The representative appearances of extirpated xenograft tumors with implantation
  of pLV-TNFRSF9 transfected MCF-7 cells. (b) The size of tumors with implantation
  of pLV-TNFRSF9 transfected MCF-7 cells. (c) Pathological H&E stained image of tumors
  with implantation of pLV-TNFRSF9 transfected MCF-7 cells. (d) Expression of Bcl-2
  (upper panel) and TNFRSF9 lower panel) in tumors with implantation of pLV-TNFRSF9
  transfected MCF-7 cells were detected by immunohistochemistry. (e) qRT-PCR assays
  for TNFRSF9 mRNA expression (upper panel) and PAX6 mRNA expression (lower panel)
  in tumors with implantation of pLV-TNFRSF9 transfected MCF-7 cells. (f) Western
  blot assays for TNFRSF9, p-P38, P38, and PAX6 protein expression in tumors with
  implantation of pLV-TNFRSF9 transfected MCF-7 cells. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
