caption: Becn1+/- mice display robust changes in signaling pathway and transcriptomes
  related to cellular function. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis of genes modified
  by SCI in Becn1+/- vs. WT mice. (B-D) Depending on the percentage of genes within
  each pathway that has been modified, the top three pathways are Inflammatory response
  (B), Cytokine signaling (C), and Innate immune response (D). The DE genes contained
  in each pathway are normalized into z-scores and the group average was used for
  the heatmaps.
