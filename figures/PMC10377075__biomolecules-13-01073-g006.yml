caption: After PAM treatment, green fluorescence represents the level of ROS in H460
  cells and PC-9 cells. (A) Fluorescence image of ROS level in H460 cells after PAM
  treatment. (B) H460 cells’ intracellular fluorescence level quantification. (C)
  Fluorescence image of ROS level in PC-9 cells after PAM treatment. (D) PC-9 cells’
  intracellular fluorescence level quantification. In (B,D), brown bars, red bars,
  yellow-green bars, green bars, blue bars and yellow bars represent the control group,
  10 s PAM treatment group, 15 s PAM treatment group, 20 s PAM treatment group, 25
  s PAM treatment group and 30 s PAM treatment group. Data represent the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. “ns” means no statistical difference. ** p < 0.01,***
  p < 0.001 with ANOVA compared with the control.
