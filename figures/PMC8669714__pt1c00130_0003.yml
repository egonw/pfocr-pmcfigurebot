caption: Components of the apoptosis pathway modulate the autophagy pathway. (a) Bcl-2
  proteins module the Vps34–-beclin1 complex. Beclin1 has a BH3 domain allowing it
  to bind to Bcl-2 proteins. Prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1)
  can form a complex with beclin1, preventing the formation of the Vps34–beclin1 complex
  and downregulating autophagy. BH3-only proteins (BIK, BID, BIM, and PUMA) indirectly
  positively regulate autophagy. The proapoptotic protein, BAX, negatively regulates
  autophagy by enhancing caspase-mediated cleavage of beclin1 and preventing it from
  interacting with Vps34. (b) p53 can both positively and negatively modulate the
  autophagy pathway depending on its cellular localization. Cytoplasmic p53 negatively
  regulates autophagy by binding to FIP200, resulting in the destabilization of the
  ULK1/2 complex. Nuclear p53 positively regulates autophagy by inducing the transcription
  of AMPK, mTOR, and DRAM. (c) IAP proteins interact with various components of the
  autophagy machinery. Survivin downregulates autophagy by inhibiting the Atg12–Atg5–Atg16
  complex and Atg7. Apollon positively regulates autophagy initiation through the
  upstream kinases AMPK and ULK1. Apollon also inhibits the fusion between autophagosomes
  and lysosomes. Similarly, XIAP can positively or negatively modulate the autophagy
  pathway via beclin1 and LC3 expression, respectively. (d) The death domain of FADD
  has been shown to upregulate autophagy under certain cellular circumstances, while
  under different cellular conditions, elevated autophagy has been shown to degrade
  DR4 and DR5.
