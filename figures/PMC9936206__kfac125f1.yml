caption: 'Viability of human neuronal cells SH-SY5Y in response to 30-min ethyl-parathion
  exposures as determined by MTT assay. The % viability data were calculated relative
  to control cells (0 μg/ml ethyl-parathion) where points represent means and error
  bars represent standard error. Significance values are represented as follows: “*”
  for p = .05.'
article_title: Cellular and molecular responses to ethyl-parathion in undifferentiated
  SH-SY5Y cells provide neurotoxicity pathway indicators for organophosphorus impacts.
