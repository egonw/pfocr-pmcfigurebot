caption: DEGs analysis and its functions annotation after lncFAM200B overexpression.
  (A) Clustering map of DEGs. (B) Volcanic map of DEGs. The up-regulation genes of
  the Notch signaling pathway members and down-regulation of cell cycle related genes
  are mapped. The top 20 enriched pathways of up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs
  are presented in (C,D), respectively. (E) GO enrichment analysis of DEGs. The GO
  terms of up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs was differentiated by red and green
  color, respectively.
