caption: Schematic representation of PEDF-activated LRP6 signaling. PEDF binds to
  the Fzd-LRP5/6 complex and activates the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The key
  protein Dvl is recruited and phosphorylated, subsequently forming a destruction
  complex that also includes Axin, CKIa, GSK3β, and APC tumor suppressors and inhibiting
  the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which is bound. This
  process leads to changes in target gene transcription and expression, which reduce
  the occurrence of relevant pathological consequences, such as oxidative stress,
  inflammation, and NV. Dvl, dishevelled; CKIa, casein kinase Ia; GSK3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β.
