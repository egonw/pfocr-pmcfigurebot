caption: 'Gene set variation analysis to compare key molecular features between high-
  and low-risk groups. Significant differences in cellular and molecular features
  between the two groups are as follows: (a) DNA replication, (b) DNA repair, (c)
  hypoxia, (d) glycolysis, (e) mitotic spindle, (f) mTORC1 signaling pathway, (g)
  MYC targets v2, (h) reactive oxygen species pathway, and (i) the B cell receptor
  pathway. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.'
