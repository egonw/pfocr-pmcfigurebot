caption: Characterization of the metabolic flux of MVA pathway of industrial strains
  using squalene as the metabolic marker. (A) Increase in squalene content in yeast
  strains via engineering HMGR activity, NADPH regeneration and cytosolic acetyl‐CoA
  supply. (B) Verification of the transcription of EfHMGR, gapC and CDC19‐PDC1 in
  different strains. (C) Cell growth. (D) Squalene production. Yeast cells were cultivated
  in YPD at 30°C for 24 h. Data are presented as the means of three biological replicates.
  Error bars represent standard deviations (n = 3). Student’s t‐test was used for
  statistical analysis. The lower‐case letters a, b, c and d in (A) and (D) indicate
  significant differences among different strains (P < 0.05). NS indicates that there
  are no significant differences among the different strains.
