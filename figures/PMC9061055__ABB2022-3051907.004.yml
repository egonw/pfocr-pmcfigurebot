caption: (a) GO enrichment analysis of coexpressed genes. In BP, we can see those
  coexpressed genes were enriched in cell-substrate adhesion, extracellular matrix
  organisation, extracellular structure organisation, cell junction assembly, and
  ameboid-type cell migration. Then, in CC, the coexpressed genes were enriched in
  cell-substrate junction, focal adhesion, and collagen-containing extracellular matrix.
  At last, in MF, the coexpressed genes were enriched in cadherin-binding, actin-binding,
  actin filament binding, and so on. (b) KEGG enrichment analysis of coexpressed genes
  showed that coexpressed genes were mainly concentrated in focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt
  signalling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, proteoglycans in cancer, ECM-receptor
  interaction, MAPK signalling pathway, small cell lung cancer, and bacterial invasion
  of epithelial cells. (c) Protein-protein interaction network of coexpressed genes.
  From this network, we can see the interaction in the coexpression mode of CD73.
  The more lines that connect, the more interactions, which means the gene may be
  more important. Besides, by using the “CytoHubba” plug-in, we screened out 20 hub
  genes according to the MCC score.
