caption: Expression of the chlorophyll biosynthesis-related (A) and degradation-related
  (B) genes in the petioles of BcGRP23-overexpressing plants. *Significant difference
  at the p < 0.05 level; **significant difference at the p < 0.01 level; ns indicates
  that the difference between the two lines is not statistically significant (Student’s
  t-test).
