caption: MiR‐2355‐5p is a target of TMEM44‐AS1 in gastric cancer. A) RIP experiments
  were performed using the Ago2 antibody, and specific primers were used to detect
  the enrichment of TMEM44‐AS1. B) RT‐qPCR was used to detect the potential target
  miRNA of TMEM44‐AS1 after knocking down TMEM44‐AS1. C) Linear regression analysis
  was done to each individual TMEM44‐AS1 and miR‐2355‐5p expression, r = −0.3041,
  p = 0.0011. D) Dual‐luciferase gene reporter assays were employed to assess the
  binding sites of TMEM44‐AS1 and miR‐2355‐5p. The relative luciferase activities
  were restrained in the HEK‐293 T cells co‐transfected with TMEM44‐AS1‐wt and miR‐2355‐5p.
  E) RT‐qPCR was used to detect the transfection efficiency of pre‐miR‐2355‐5p and
  anti‐miR‐2355‐5p. F) 5‐FU (5 μg mL−1) was added to cell medium, the proliferative
  abilities of HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells subject to pre‐NC, pre‐miR‐2355‐5p, anti‐miR‐2355‐5p,
  or anti‐NC transfection were measured through CCK‐8 assay. Proliferation rates at
  diverse time periods were calculated relative to that at 0 h. G) Proliferative abilities
  of HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells subject to pre‐NC, pre‐miR‐2355‐5p, anti‐miR‐ 2355‐5p,
  or anti‐NC transfection were analyzed through EdU assay. Scale bar, 20 µm. H) The
  cell apoptosis rates were determined for the two 5‐FU‐resistant cells through flow
  cytometry. I) ABCC1, ABCG2, Survivin, Caspase3, cleaved caspase‐3, and GAPDH protein
  expression was measured in both 5‐ FU‐resistant lines by western blotting after
  transfection with pre‐NC, pre‐miR‐2355‐5p, anti‐miR‐2355‐5p, or anti‐NC. J) P53,
  AIFM2, Bcl‐ 2, Bax, and GAPDH protein levels in HGC‐27/R and MKN‐45/R cells treated
  with pre‐miR‐2355‐5p, pre‐NC, anti‐miR‐2355‐5p, or anti‐NC. 5 µg mL−1 5‐FU was used
  to treat cells for a 48‐h period before EdU assay, flow cytometric analysis, and
  protein extraction. Data are mean ± SD, n = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
