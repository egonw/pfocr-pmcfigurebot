caption: Distribution of DEGs from RNA-seq data. (A) Volcano graph of DEGs representing
  the downregulated genes with blue color and upregulated DEGs with red color after
  12 h of SA treatment. (B) Volcano graph of DEGs representing the downregulated genes
  with blue color and upregulated DEGs with red color after 24 h of SA treatment.
  (C) Volcano graph of DEGs representing the downregulated genes with blue color and
  upregulated DEGs with red color after 48 h of SA treatment. (D) Venn diagram analysis
  of DEGs identified from all time points. (E) Total number of DEGs that were significantly
  down- or upregulated in response to SA treatment. Log2 FC ≥ 1 or ≤−1 and p < 0.01
  FDR.
