caption: Nephropathy 1st inhibited TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast formation. (A) HE
  staining of rat kidneys. (B) Serum creatinine (CREN), urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine
  protein concentrations were measured in the blood of rats. (C) Sirius Red staining
  and (D) Masson staining of different kidney tissues. (E) IHC staining of TGF-β1,
  collagen III, and α-SMA in rat kidneys. Data were representative of three independent
  experiments. Data were shown as mean ± SD, *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.
