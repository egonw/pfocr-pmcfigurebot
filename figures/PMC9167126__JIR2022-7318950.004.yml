caption: miR-138-5p reduces tumour cell tube formation by targeting HIF-1α/VEGFA signalling.
  (a) The structure of miR-138-5p was predicted from miRTarBase (http://mirtarbase.
  http://cuhk.edu.cn/). (b) The predicted binding site of miR-138-5p in the 3′-UTR
  of HIF-1α and the mutated 3′-UTR of HIF-1α. (c) A luciferase reporter plasmid containing
  the wild-type HIF-1α 3′-UTR or the mutant HIF-1α 3′-UTR was transfected into 293
  T cells alone or cotransfected with the NC or miR-138-5p mimic, and luciferase activity
  was measured. (d) and (e) qRT–PCR detection of HIF-1α and VEGFA mRNA expression
  in HCC cells treated with the miR-138-5p mimic (d) or inhibitor (e). (f) Western
  blot detection of HIF-1α and VEGFA protein expression in HCC cells transfected with
  the miR-138-5p mimic or inhibitor or with the HIF-1α inhibitor CAY10585 under normal
  oxygen and hypoxic conditions. (g) The HIF-1α inhibitor CAY10585 reversed the effects
  of the miR-138-5p inhibitor on tube formation by HCC cells. Data are shown as the
  mean ± SD. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times. ∗Represents P < 0.05;
  ∗∗Represents P < 0.01; ∗∗∗Represents P < 0.001.
