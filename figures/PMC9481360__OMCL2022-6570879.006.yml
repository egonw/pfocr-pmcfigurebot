caption: '(a) QRT-PCR analysis presented that IPO5 expression in esophageal cancer
  cell lines was higher than that in normal HEEC esophageal cells, and the highest
  expression was found in OE33 and ECA109 cells. (b) Western blot assay showed that
  the expression of IPO5 was significantly downregulated after interference with IPO5
  lentivirus by esophageal carcinoma cells (note: ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01).'
