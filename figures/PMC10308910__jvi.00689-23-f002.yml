caption: PDCoV infection of newborn piglets causes the loss of goblet cells from intestinal
  villi, thereby resulting in decreased mucus secretion. (A) Jejunum tissues were
  stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) to quantitate goblet cells per villus (black
  arrows). Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) Jejunum tissues were stained for MUC-2 (black arrows).
  Scale bar = 50 μm. (C) MUC-2 mRNA levels in homogenized jejunum tissues. (D) The
  mucus granules (m) in goblet cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy
  (TEM). Scale bar = 2 μm. (E) UEA-1+ cells (green) and PDCoV (yellow) in jejunum.
  Scale bar = 200 μm. (F) MUC-2+ cells (green) and PDCoV (red) in jejunum. Scale bar
  = 100 μm. **, P < 0.01.
