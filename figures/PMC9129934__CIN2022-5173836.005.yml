caption: 'Zizhu ointment accelerates wound healing in diabetic ulcer mice by suppressing
  the expression of Notch4 and promoting M2 macrophage polarization. (a) Western blotting
  results of Notch4 in control and Notch4 knockout groups. (b) Representative images
  of wounds healing after different treatments. (c) Wound closure on days 3, 7, and
  14 by Image J (n = 10). (d) The count of F4/80+ cells in different groups. (e) The
  ratio of M1/M2 in different groups. (f) Relative expression of IL-6 MCP-1, iNOS,
  and TNF-α. (g) Relative expression of IL-4, CD206, ARG1, and IL-10. ∗p < 0.05 vs
  control group; ∗∗p < 0.01 vs control group; #p < 0.05 vs diabetic ulcer group; ##p
  < 0.01 vs diabetic ulcer group.'
