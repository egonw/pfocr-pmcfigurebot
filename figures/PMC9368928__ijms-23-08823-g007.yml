caption: BSA activates PI3K/AKT/SGK1 signaling pathway. FDLE cells were cultured in
  MEM and stimulated with BSA (1.0 g/L) for 45 min. Data are displayed as mean + SEM.
  BSA significantly increased (A) AKT and (B) NDRG1 phosphorylation (n = 11â€“13; *
  p < 0.05 by t-test). Western blots of pAKT and total AKT resulted in bands of 60
  kDa. Western Blot of pNDRG1 and total NDRG1 resulted in bands of 46 and 48 kDa.
  (C) Western blot of pNEDD4L and total NEDD4L resulted in bands of 110 and 135 kDa
  (ns = non-significant).
