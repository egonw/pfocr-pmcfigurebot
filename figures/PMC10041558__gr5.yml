caption: 'LPI-18:1 Induces Acute Signaling Events Associated with Insulin Action in
  Adipose Tissue of Mboat7ASKO mice. A: Volcano plot of phosphopeptides upregulated
  and downregulated in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) of Mboat7ASKO mice. Phosphopeptides
  determined to be |log2FoldChange| >0.5 different in the LPI and saline samples with
  a P-value <0.05 (two-tailed t test) were considered significantly differentially
  phosphorylated. (Average of n = 4/group; pink dots represent significantly upregulated
  phospho-peptides, green dots represent significantly downregulated phospho-peptides;
  and purple dots represent insulin resistance-associated phosphopeptides that are
  significantly different). B, C: KEGG pathway analysis of significantly differentially
  phosphorylated peptides. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LPI, lysophosphatidylinositol;
  Mboat7ASKO, Mboat7 adipocyte-specific knockout mice.'
article_title: MBOAT7-driven lysophosphatidylinositol acylation in adipocytes contributes
  to systemic glucose homeostasis.
