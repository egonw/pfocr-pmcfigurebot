caption: ITGA5 plasmid screening and lentiviral cell line construction for stable
  transfection. (a–d) Expression of the silenced ITGA5 was significantly reduced in
  AGS and MKN-28 cells compared to control by qRT-PCR and Western blot. (e–h) Successful
  overexpression of ITGA5, since it was significantly increased in AGS and MKN-28
  cells. (i–l) Stable transfection of sh-ITGA5 expression in two gastric cancer cell
  lines after transfection with ITGA5 and OE-ITGA5 plasmids (∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001
  by t-test). Screening the plasmid of ITGA5 gene and constructing a stable cell line.
