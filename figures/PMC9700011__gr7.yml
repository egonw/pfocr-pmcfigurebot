caption: Identification of genome-wide DNA binding sites and transcription targets
  for BMP4 by ChIP-seq. (A) Detection of the immunoprecipitation efficiency of BMP4
  overexpressed granular cells with SMAD4 antibody binding. (B) ChIP peaks over chromosomes
  by ChIP-seq using the primary antibody against BMP4 (the right represents the chromosome
  number, the left ordinate represents the peak value of each chromosome). (C) The
  distribution of reads on both sides of the transcription start site (TSS). (D) Pie
  diagram showed the ratios of BMP4 binding sites located relative to a transcription
  unit including intergenic, 1st intron, 1st exon, promotor, other intron and other
  exon. (E) GO enrichment of Peak related genes (top ten terms of each category).
  (F) KEGG enrichment map of metabolic pathways of Peak related genes (top 20 pathways).
  (G) Five common motifs with the most significant differences among peaks. (H) Interaction
  network diagram between TFs and genes based on sequencing results, purple represented
  the transcription factor or transcription factor family, red represented the target
  gene that TF may act through motifs. (I) Validation of the expression level of annotated
  genes BAMBI and CPEB2 in granular cells with BMP4 overexpression or knockdown plasmid.
