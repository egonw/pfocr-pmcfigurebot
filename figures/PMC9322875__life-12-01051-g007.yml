caption: The starch and sucrose metabolism pathway analysis in RNA-Seq. The grey columns
  with black squares represent drought stress while white columns with black circles
  represent CK treatment. The different lower-case letters above the columns show
  significant differences (Î± = 0.05, LSD). (A) The schematic diagram of starch and
  sucrose metabolism pathway; the red boxes represent upregulated modules while green
  boxes represented downregulated modules, the blue boxes represent upregulated and
  downregulated DEGs contain; (B) The expression profile of DEGs in modules enriched
  in pathways, the color from blue to red represent the expression from low to high;
  (C) The sucrose content analysis under CK and drought treatments; (D) The starch
  content analysis under CK and drought treatments; (E) The activities of alpha-amylase
  analysis under CK and drought treatments; (F) The activities of beta-amylase analysis
  under CK and drought treatments.
