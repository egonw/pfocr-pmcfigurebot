caption: Welded-Pipe illustration of Basic Pathway BP12sThe TCA cycle is symbolized
  by the diamond core. Substrates NAD and ADP enter the cycle, and products NADH and
  ATP exit, as shown. Each pipe section symbolizes a reaction in the model, with diameters
  and number of pipes related to the coefficients given by the W matrix. Molecular
  species are viewed as flowing through the pipe section under steady-state conditions.
