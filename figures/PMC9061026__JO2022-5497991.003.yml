caption: 'LA arrests the proliferation of VEGF-stimulated MKN-45 cells. (a) The expression
  of VEGFR-2 protein in SGC-7901, MKN-45, MGC-803, and GES-1 cells. (b) Relative VEGFR-2
  expression levels were quantified in SGC-7901, MKN-45, MGC-803, and GES-1 cells.
  GSE-1 is the reference. (c) The p-VEGFR-2 expression level of LA-treated VEGF-stimulated
  MKN-45 cell. (d) Relative p-VEGFR-2 protein expression levels were quantified by
  normalization to GAPDH values as the mean of three independent experiments. (e)
  The proliferation of VEGF-stimulated MKN-45 cells was measured by the CCK8 assay.
  (f) LA inhibited the colony formation of VEGF-stimulated MKN-45 cells. (g) 3D microsphere
  was observed at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. Bar = 200 μm. Values are
  given as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) experiments. n = 3. ∗p < 0.05
  vs. control and ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. control. #p < 0.05 vs. VEGF 20 ng/mL + LA 0 μM and
  ##p < 0.01 vs. VEGF 20 ng/mL + LA 0 μM.'
