caption: KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed metabolites. x-axis and
  the bubble size represented Impact of the pathways in the topological analysis,
  y-axis and the bubble color represented âˆ’ln p value of the pathways in the enrichment
  analysis. âˆ’ln p-value > 3.00 means p < 0.05. (A) Differential metabolic pathways
  between PB and PU. (B) Differential metabolic pathways between PB and PP. (C) Differential
  metabolic pathways between PU and PP. PB, PU, and PP represent P. bretschneideri,
  P. usssuriensis and P. pyrifolia, respectively.
