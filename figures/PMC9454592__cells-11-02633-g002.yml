caption: 'Recruitment of ARID1A to regulatory elements of TGF-β signaling pathway
  genes upon Bex+Carv treatment and associated change in target gene expression and
  phenotype in HME-hTert cells. (A) ChIP-Seq tracks of H3K27ac in control and Bex+Carv-treated
  HME-hTert cells across FoxQ1, KLF4, BMP6, and TGFBR2 genes showing the promoter
  and the studied regulatory regions, exported from the Integrative Genomics Viewer
  (IGV) application. (B) Quantitation of ARID1A and Brg1 enrichment and H3K27ac marks
  to the putative regulatory elements assigned to FoxQ1, KLF4, BMP6, and TGFBR2 genes
  after Veh or 100 nmole/L Bex + 1000 nmole/L Carv treatment for 6 h in HME-hTert
  cells. N = 3 representing 3 biological replicates. The dashed line represents the
  signal derived from the negative control sample. (C) RT-qPCR analysis of target
  gene transcript levels upon Vehicle or 100 nmole/L Bex + 1000 nmole/L Carv treatment
  for 6 h in case of KLF4 and BMP6 and 24 h in case of FoxQ1 and TGFBR2. N = 3 representing
  3 biological replicates. (D) RT-qPCR analysis of ARID1A, FoxQ1, BMP6, and KLF4 gene
  expression upon 20 nmole/L siRNA transfection for 48 h, and TGFBR2 gene expression
  upon 72 h of 20 nmole/L siRNA transfection. The gene expression results are presented
  as a percentage relative to the control sample (siNT). N = 3 representing 3 biological
  replicates. (E) RT-qPCR analysis for the transcript levels of Fibronectin 1 after
  24 h, N-cadherin after 6 h, and E-cadherin after 24 h of 100 nmole/L Bex+ 1000 nmole/L
  Carv combination treatment in HME-hTert cells. The results are expressed as mean
  ± SD * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 by two-tailed Student’s t-test. (F) Representative
  fluorescent images of HME-hTert cell morphology after 72 h of vehicle, Bex+Carv,
  or TGF-β treatment. Blue: DAPI nuclear stain, Red: CellMask cytoplasmic stain; images
  taken at 20× magnifications.'
