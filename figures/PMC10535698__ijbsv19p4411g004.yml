caption: RHOJ enhances the angiogenesis of GC. (A) Pathway enrichment analysis of
  the genes highly related to RHOJ expression, based on the GSE62254 dataset. (B)
  Pathway enrichment analysis of the genes highly related to RHOJ expression, based
  on the TCGA database. (C) Pearson correlation analysis evaluated the links between
  the expression levels of PECAM1 (CD31) with RHOJ in the GSE62254 dataset. (D) Pearson
  correlation analysis evaluated the links between the expression levels of PECAM1
  (CD31) with RHOJ in the TCGA database. (E) Representative images and statistical
  charts of the formed tubes in HUVEC angiogenesis assay, scale bar, 200 μm. (F) Protein
  levels of RHOJ and VEGFA were detected by western blotting in RHOJ knockdown cells
  (SGC7901, SNU-1). (G) IHC staining representative images of CD31 in mice lung metastatic
  foci, scale bar, 50 μm. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. Data were expressed
  as Mean±SD.
