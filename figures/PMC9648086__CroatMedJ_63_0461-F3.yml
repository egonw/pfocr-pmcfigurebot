caption: (A) Mice that were injected unsorted B16F10 cells and tumors resected from
  ornidazole-treated and control mice that received unsorted cell injection. (B) Mice
  that were injected CD133+ B16F10 cells. (C) Mice that were injected CD133- B16F10
  cells and tumors resected from ornidazole-treated and control mice that received
  CD133- cell injection. (D) After ornidazole treatment, average tumor volume measurements
  of the unsorted group (***P < 0.001), (E) CD133+ (4th day **P < 0.01, 9th-12th day
  ***P < 0.001), and (F) CD133- groups (2nd day *P < 0.5, 9th-12th day ***P < 0.001).
  All groups were compared with the control group (two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction
  for multiple comparisons).
