caption: General view of the phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathway highlighting the expression
  changes in response to ABA treatment that explains the increment of color in Fragaria
  chiloensis fruit. In the scheme, green arrows indicate the increment in expression
  promoted by ABA; light blue arrow indicates a transitory increment in the expression;
  blue arrows indicate no changes in the expression level; yellow arrows denote a
  transient reduction in the expression followed by the increment in expression; red
  arrows indicate a decrease in the expression level; dashed blue line indicate that
  transcripts for the gene were not detected in the fruit. The metabolic pathway has
  been modified from [].
