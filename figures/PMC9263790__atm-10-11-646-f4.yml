caption: Proposed schematic representation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and
  key mechanisms in hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  system activation occurs through the classical pathway of aldosterone secretion.
  Additional corticotrophin independent pathways include effects of cytokines and
  vasopressin, which trigger corticotrophin release, independent of hypothalamic control.
  Critical illness triggers release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus.
  Corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulates the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic
  hormone, which stimulates the release of cortisol and to a lesser extent, aldosterone
  from the adrenal cortex. In a subset of critically ill patients, the loss of regulatory
  negative feedback mechanisms results in the dissociation of renin and aldosterone
  (hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism) which is characterized by hyperreninemia in the
  face of inappropriately low aldosterone and is associated with a higher mortality.
  HPA, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; CRH, corticotropin-releasing
  hormone; RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; CIRCI, critical illness-related
  corticosteroid insufficiency; CIRMI, critical illnessrelated mineralocorticoid insufficiency.
