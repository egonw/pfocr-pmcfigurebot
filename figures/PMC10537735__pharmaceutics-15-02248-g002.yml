caption: Liposomal CRE-SD preparation process. The dried powders of Curcuma longa
  rhizomes were applied to derive a curcuminoid-rich extract (CRE) comprising curcumin,
  demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. To obtain CRE-SD with 7% w/w of curcuminoids,
  the resulting CRE was modified with polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP K30)—the synthetic
  polymer produced from the monomer termed N-vinyl pyrrolidone—using the solid dispersion
  technique. To obtain liposomal CRE-SD, the liposomal encapsulation method was subsequently
  used to interpose the CRE-SD in the lipid bilayer of the POPC liposomes.
