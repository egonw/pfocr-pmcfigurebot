caption: Increased expression of EFEMP2 attenuated BCa cells proliferation and migration
  in vitro. (A) qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses affirmed the interfering and upregulated
  efficiency of EFEMP2 in relevant BCa cells (T24, J82 and UM-UC-3). (B) The MTT assay
  assessed the ability of proliferation and viability in EFEMP2-silencing and EFEMP2-overexpression
  BCa cells. (C) Clonogenic survival assay estimated the capacity of colony formation
  in EFEMP2-silencing and EFEMP2-overexpression BCa cells and the clone number was
  statistically analyzed. (D) The transwell migration assay calculated the migration
  ability in EFEMP2-silencing and EFEMP2-overexpression BCa cells and the cell number
  was statistically analyzed. (E) Representative EFEMP2 (green) and Ki67 (green) staining
  in EFEMP2-silencing and EFEMP2-overexpression BCa cells. Nuclei are counterstained
  by DAPI (blue). *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.
