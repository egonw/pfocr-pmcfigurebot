caption: 'Kinase activity and pathway analysis of GS.1012 and GS.1025 2D cell cultures.
  (A) Human kinome tree representing the kinase groups detected with QuantaKinome™.
  Red dots represents the kinases detected in both GS.1012 and GS.1025 samples. Blue
  dots represent kinases detected only in GS.1025. Yellow dots represent kinases detected
  only in GS.1012. (ACG: Containing PKA, PKG, PKC families; CAMK: Calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase; CK1: Casein kinase 1; CMGC: Containing CDK, MAPK, GSK3, CLK families;
  STE: Homologs of yeast Sterile 7, Sterile 11, Sterile 20 kinases; TK: Tyrosine kinase;
  TKL: Tyrosine kinase-like). Illustration made with KinMap (www.kinhub.org/kinmap/).
  (B) Venn Diagram showing the number of common and specific kinases identified in
  GS.1012 and GS.1025. (C) Differential activity analysis in 2D cell cultures treated
  with temozolomide (TMZ), enzastaurin (ENZA), and imatinib (IMA) in GS.1012 and GS.1025.
  Heatmaps showing the log2 fold changes of kinase activity of the treatments compared
  to the untreated controls. Gray boxes represent kinase activities identified only
  in the treatment or in the control condition. n=3; *FDR adjusted-p < 0.05; ** FDR
  adjusted-p < 0.01. (D) Pathway analysis of 2D GS.1012 and GS.1025 cell cultures.
  Dotplot showing the top 10 pathways using the detected kinases in GS.1012 (top)
  and GS.1025 (bottom) untreated cells. The dot size represents the number of kinases
  detected, while the distribution on the x-axis indicate the q-value. The pathways
  source is WikiPathways. (E) ErbB signaling pathway representation according to WikiPathways
  of kinases detected in GS.1012 and GS.1025. The orange boxes represent the detected
  kinases with QuantaKinome™. The pathway has been acquired from WikiPathways (www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP673).
  The gray boxes represent kinases present in the QuantaKinome™ library but not detected
  in the study. On the right, the heatmaps showing the log2 fold changes of the kinases
  belonging to the Erbb signaling pathway in GS.1025 (top) and GS.1012 (bottom).'
