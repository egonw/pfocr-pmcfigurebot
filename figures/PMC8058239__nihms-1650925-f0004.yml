caption: Significantly mutated pathways in 92 GBC tumors (84 Chinese and 8 Chilean).
  (A) List of significantly mutated KEGG pathways in gallbladder. Only pathways with
  a corrected p-value of â‰¤0.05 are shown. (B) Interactions between individual mutated
  genes of three major pathways (p53 pathway, WNT signaling pathway and MAPK signaling
  pathway) related to cell cycle, apoptosis and genomic instability, and other three
  pathways (antigen-processing and presentation, host versus graft disease and intestinal
  immune network for IgA production) related to immune response. These pathways included
  genes, such as CDKN2A and NF1, known to have recurrent somatic copy number alternations.
  The number inside the box indicates the number of patient with mutation in this
  gene. The percentage of affected patients with mutations in each pathway compared
  to all patients analyzed are denoted on top ().
