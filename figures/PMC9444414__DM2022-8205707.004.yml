caption: Inhibition of Akt curbed the protective effect of α-cyperone against OGD-induced
  myocardial injury. After treatment of OGD-induced cardiomyocytes with α-cyperone
  (60 μM) for 24 hours, the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 was added. (a) The viability of
  cardiomyocytes was assessed with the CCK-8 assay. (b) Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was
  examined by flow cytometry. (c) The profiles of apoptosis-related proteins were
  assessed by qRT-PCR. (d) The expression of inflammatory factors was tested by qRT-PCR.
  (e) Expression of inflammatory response proteins was checked by WB. (f) Detection
  of the MDA content and SOD activity was implemented by the colorimetric assay. (g)
  The ROS production was evaluated by the ROS assay kit. All experiments were repeated
  three times, and the data were expressed as mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 (vs. OGD), ∗∗P
  < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001. &P < 0.05 (vs. OGD+α-cyperone (60 μM)), &&P < 0.01.
