figure_title: Schematic illustration of the pivotal role of CTRP9 in reendothelialization
  of EPCs and the protective mechanisms of AMPK‐mediated Akt/eNOS signaling involved
  in adipoR1 and N‐cadherin receptor
caption: Chronic exposure to HG impairs the reendothelialization capacity of EPCs.
  Treatment with gCTRP9 restores EPC functions and reendothelialization capacity under
  the HG environment through adipoR1 (not adipoR2) and N‐cadherin–mediated AMPK/Akt/eNOS
  pathway. adipoR1 indicates adiponectin receptor 1; adipoR2, adiponectin receptor
  2; Akt, protein kinase B; AMPK, AMP‐activated protein kinase; EC, endothelial cell;
  eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; EPC, endothelial progenitor cell; gCTRP9,
  globular C1q/tumor necrosis factor–related protein‐9; HG, high‐glucose; and VSMC,
  vascular smooth muscle cell.

  Cytokine That Restores High Glucose‐Suppressed Endothelial Progenitor Cell Functions
  by Activating the Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase.
