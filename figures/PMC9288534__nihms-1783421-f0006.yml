figure_title: Chemical-gene interactions for 90 genes in three key Gene Ontology (GO)
  terms for chemicals detected at higher levels in non-Hispanic Black women
caption: We identified 77 GO terms enriched in the preterm birth gene list. We selected
  three of these GO terms for downstream analysis due to their relevance to the etiology
  of preterm birth (“inflammatory response”, “aging” and “response to estradiol”)
  and plotted chemical-gene interactions for all preterm birth genes involved in on
  more of the prioritized biological pathway. Individual gene-chemical interactions
  are shown in (A) and the number of preterm birth genes in each biological pathway
  impacted by each chemical are shown in (B).
