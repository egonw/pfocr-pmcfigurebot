figure_title: OCAR platform possesses an intrinsic off-switch control, and ABA-regulated
  OCAR can be used to increase synNotch activity during cell-cell communication
caption: 'a Left: SEAP levels in the supernatants of HEK-293 cells transfected pPW116C29S,C102S,
  pPW86WT, and reporter plasmid pTS1017. Following the transfection, cells were treated
  with different concentrations of γ-secretase inhibitor LY411575 along with ABA (100 µM)
  or DMSO for 24 h. Right: alamarBlue cell viability assay of the previous samples.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples. b, c
  The same experiment as shown in (a) for OCARs regulated by RAPA (b) and GA (c).
  For analysis of the RAPA-regulated OCAR, the cells were transfected with pPW112C22S.
  For analysis of the GA-regulated OCAR pPW124C155S, C157S, C362S was transfected.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples. d SEAP
  levels in the supernatants of cells transfected with the indicated plasmids. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples. ***P < 0.0001
  was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. e SEAP levels in the
  supernatants of co-cultured cells. Receiver cells were transfected either with pMMH209,
  pMMH212, and pPW116C29S,C102S, combination or with anti-CD19-synNotch-TetR-VP64.
  The transfected receiver cells were co-cultured with sender cells that overexpress
  CD19 or sender cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+), in presence/absence
  ABA. Data are presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples.
  ***P < 0.0001 was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. f Immunoblotting
  against FLAG and β-actin of cells separately transfected with pMMH234 (PhPGK-SS-ABI-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-2xFLAG-pAbGH),
  pMMH233 (PhPGK-SS-ABIC29S,C102S-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-2xFLAG-pAbGH), pMMH230 (PhPGK-SS-FKBP-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-2xFLAG-pAbGH),
  pMMH231(PhPGK-SS-FKBPC22S-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-2xFLAG-pAbGH), pMMH232(PhPGK-SS-GID1-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-2xFLAG-pAbGH),
  and pMMH235 (PhPGK-SS-GID1C155S,C157S,C362S-Notch1core-TetR-VP64-2xFLAG-pAbGH) followed
  by cycloheximide chase (see Methods). g Immunoblotting against FLAG and β-actin
  of cells separately transfected with the same plasmids as above. For each sample,
  the cleared lysate was divided equally into two parts and sample buffer with or
  without DTT was added. h Immunoblotting against FLAG following AMS shift assay of
  cells transfected with the same plasmids as above (see Methods). Source data are
  provided as a  file.'
