caption: 'Expression of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes in WT and PANS-CmDFR-RNAi
  transgenic chrysanthemum ray florets (A) and leaves (B). Biosynthetic pathway genes
  evaluated: early biosynthetic genes chalcone synthase (CmCHS), chalcone isomerase
  (CmCHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (CmF3H), flavone synthase (CmFNS), flavonol synthase
  (CmFLS), and flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (CmF3′H), and the late biosynthetic genes
  dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (CmANS), and UDP-glucose:
  flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (CmUFGT). The chrysanthemum elongation factor
  1α (CmEF1α) gene was used as a reference gene to normalize target gene expression.
  All results represent mean values ± SD from three independent biological replicates.
  Different letters above the bars indicate significantly different values (p < 0.01,
  one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s multiple range test).'
