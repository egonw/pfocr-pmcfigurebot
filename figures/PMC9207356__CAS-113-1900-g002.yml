caption: 'Cell competition in MDCK cells and mouse liver cells. (A) Left: MDCK cells
  expressing active Yes‐associated protein (YAP) (red) maintain normal cell numbers
  in a monoculture. Right: MDCK cells expressing active YAP are forced to undergo
  elimination by apical extrusion in the presence of WT MDCK cells (green). (B) The
  normal mouse liver maintains its size and functionality through various mechanisms
  that control cell proliferation and remove senescent, damaged or abnormal cells.
  For example, if a hepatocyte sustains a change that causes it to constitutively
  express YAP (red cells), the cell proliferates. “Size control” mechanisms then act
  to remove the altered cells and restore normal liver size. If these mechanisms fail,
  the altered cells proliferate uncontrollably and liver cancer may develop. Similarly,
  if traumatic liver injury damages a hepatocyte, YAP can become activated and “quality
  control” mechanisms are triggered to return the liver to normalcy. The injured cell
  may be eliminated by apical extrusion or induction of apoptosis, followed by Kupffer
  cell‐mediated engulfment'
