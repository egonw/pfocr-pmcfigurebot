caption: 'The combination of 2′-O-methylperlatolic acid (2-O-M) and insulin activates
  the insulin signaling pathway and stimulates cellular sugar uptake. (a) Expression
  of key proteins of the insulin signaling pathway in different groups of 2-O-M and
  insulin in Hepa 1-6 cells. (b) The expression of key proteins in the insulin signaling
  pathway in different groups of 2-O-M and insulin in C2C12 cells. (c) The effect
  of 2-O-M combined with insulin on glucose uptake capacity in C2C12 cells. Data are
  shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 6/7 in each group). ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  versus control. #p < 0.05; ##p < 0.01; ###p < 0.001 versus insulin. †p < 0.05; ††p
  < 0.01, 2-O-M versus insulin+2-O-M.'
