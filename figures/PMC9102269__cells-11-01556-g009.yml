caption: Schematic illustration of synthesis, trafficking, recycling, and degradation
  of Pgp in a hepatocyte (based on Fu [] and LÃ¶scher and Gericke []). Additionally,
  major steps in the formation of endosomes and lysosomes are shown. Organelle markers
  are shown in yellow. In addition, passive drug diffusion into the cell and drug
  trapping of weak-base lipophilic agents (such as doxorubicin) by endolysosomes is
  illustrated. Please note that the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase also occurs
  in endosomes [,], which is not illustrated. At least in part, this enzyme is transported
  via a constitutive pathway from Golgi via the cell membrane to endosomes and endolysosomes
  [,], which is not illustrated either. A similar constitutive pathway also exists
  for LAMP-2 [,], so transport vesicles and endosomes may contain this membrane protein
  (not illustrated). The figure was created with BioRender.com (accessed on 7 April
  2022).
