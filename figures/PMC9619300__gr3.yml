  drugs in male pan-cancer(A) Heatmaps representing spearman correlation coefficients
  of mRNA expression levels and cytotoxicity to antifolate drugs in male (n = 325)
  and female (n = 276) pan-cancer cell lines. Colored squares reached FDR-adjusted

  biosynthesis of serine from glucose and the folate cycle demonstrating mRNA expression
  of 4,076 male and 2,782 female pan-cancer tumor samples with a male (blue) or female
