figure_title: Notch3 regulates the expression of Ang1 via the Akt1 signaling pathway
caption: a MASMCs were isolated from Akt1WT and Akt1∆SMC mice, and the activation
  of Notch3 was assessed by western blot analysis. b Retinas were stained with IB4
  (green), Notch3 (red), and DAPI (blue). Bar, 10 μm. c The fluorescence intensity
  of nuclear Notch3 (n = 4–5) was quantified with Student’s t test. *P < 0.05. Akt1
  or Akt2 was silenced in VSMCs, and the expression of Akt1/2 and activation of Notch1
  and Notch3 were verified by western blot analysis (d) and immunocytochemistry (e).
  Bar, 50 μm. f Quantification of nuclear Notch3 expression (n = 5). *P < 0.05, one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. g Akt1 was silenced in VSMCs,
  and the expression of Notch3 target genes was verified by qPCR (n = 3). *P < 0.05,
  Student’s t test. h–j Notch3 was silenced in VSMCs, and the expression of Ang1 was
  assessed by western blotting (h), qPCR (i), and immunocytochemistry (j) (n = 3).
  Bar, 50 μm. *P < 0.05, Student’s t test. k The fluorescence intensity of Ang1 (n = 5–8)
  was quantified with Student’s t test. *P < 0.05. NICD3 was ectopically expressed
  in VSMCs, and Ang1 expression was verified by western blotting (l), qPCR (m), and
  immunocytochemistry (n) (n = 3). Bar, 50 μm. *P < 0.05, Student’s t test. o The
  fluorescence intensity of NICD3 (n = 7) and Ang1 (n = 6) was quantified with Student’s
  t test. *P < 0.05. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
