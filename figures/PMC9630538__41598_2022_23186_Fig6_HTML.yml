caption: 'Antitumor effect of PG in the LN229 xenograft model. (a) The growth curves
  of LN229 xenograft tumors in PG and vehicle-treated nude mice: the size of tumors
  was measured by Vernier calipers every five days. Tumor volume calculation formula:
  Length × width × width/2. Data are expressed as the means ± SEM. p < 0.05. (b) Graphic
  representation of body weight. Data are expressed as the means ± SD. p < 0.05. (c)
  Bioluminescent signals in mice were detected immediately after injecting D-luciferin
  potassium salt (Day 25). (d) Immunohistochemistry staining of Ki67 in the tumor
  sections from control or PG group.(e) The protein levels of KIAA1524 and β-actin
  in LN229 xenograft tumors were measured by western blotting. (f) Graphic representation
  of relative levels of protein expression in tumors. Data are expressed as the means ± SD.
  p < 0.05.'
