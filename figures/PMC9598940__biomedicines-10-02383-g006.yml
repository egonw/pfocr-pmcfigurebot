caption: 'Influence of NAR and HSP, along with their combination, on THP-1 cell cycle
  progression after 48 h (A) and 72 h (B) of treatment. The plots are representative
  of three different experimental sessions of PI staining performed in triplicate
  (n = 9). Percentages of cells present in each phase of the cell cycle are reported
  in the histograms (sub-G0/G1: white; G0/G1: green; S: yellow; G2/M: cyan).'
