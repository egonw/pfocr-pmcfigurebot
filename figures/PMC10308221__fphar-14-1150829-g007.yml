caption: Effects of tetrandrine on the expression levels of MAPK/NF-κB in HRMCs. Cells
  were treated with 2 μM of tetrandrine in the presence or absence of deS/deGal IgA
  for 48 h. The cell lysates were examined by Western blot. More than three independent
  experiments were carried out and representative results were shown in the figures.
  β-actin was used as internal control and re-used to compare the expression levels
  of MAPK/NF-κB and their phosphorylation protein conveniently. Statistical analyses
  were performed using Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests, **p < 0.01, ***p <
  0.001 and ****p < 0.0001 respectively. (n = 6).
article_title: Tetrandrine inhibits the proliferation of mesangial cells induced by
  enzymatically deglycosylated human IgA1 via IgA receptor/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.
