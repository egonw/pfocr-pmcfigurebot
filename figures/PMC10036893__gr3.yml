caption: 'RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis: (A–D) Heatmaps of migration-related,
  angiogenesis-related, osteogenesis-related, and RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway gene
  expression after culturing BMSCs in all groups for 7 days (red: high expression;
  green: low expression). (E–J) qPCR analysis of four genes (DVL2, DAAM1, RhoA, ROCK2)
  related to RhoA/ROCK2, Lamin A, and YAP1 in BMSCs among scaffolds with various pore
  morphologies for 7 days. (K, L) Relative protein expression of phosphorylated RhoA
  and ROCK2 in each group of Western blot bands was calculated with normalization
  to GAPDH (n = 3, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).'
article_title: 3D printed pore morphology mediates bone marrow stem cell behaviors
  via RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway for accelerating bone regeneration.
