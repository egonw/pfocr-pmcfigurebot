figure_title: CAR activation induces pro-inflammatory gene programs in Tregs
caption: (A) Heatmap clustered by column (sample) and by row (gene) with top 100 most
  differentially expressed genes between No Act Tregs, TCR Tregs, CAR Tregs, No Act
  Teff, TCR Teff, and CAR Teff. (B) Venn diagram with genes upregulated in TCR Tregs,
  CAR Tregs, TCR Teff, and CAR Teff in relation to their respective No Act cell types.
  Number of genes and respective percentage of the total number of genes are indicated
  in each intersection. (C) Top 20 protein-coding genes most differentially expressed
  in CAR Tregs compared with TCR Tregs. FC, fold change; padj, adjusted p value. (D)
  KEGG pathway gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of CAR Tregs vs. TCR Tregs. FDR,
  false discovery rate.
