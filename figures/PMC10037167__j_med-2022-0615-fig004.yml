caption: 'Effects of siMTSN on the protein expressions related to apoptosis and Smad3/PKA/Nox4
  signaling pathway in Ang II-induced AB8/13 cells. AB8/13 cells were treated with
  Ang II (100 nmol/L) to induce MN cell model, followed by the transfection of siNC
  or siMSTN. (a–d) Expressions of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved
  Caspase-3) in the control, model, model + siNC, and model + siMSTN groups were examined
  by western blot. GAPDH acted as the internal reference. (e–h) Expressions of Smad3/PKA/Nox4
  signaling pathway-related proteins (p-Smad3, Smad3, p-PKA, PKA, and Nox4) were determined
  by western blot, with GAPDH serving as the internal reference. All experiments were
  repeated three times to obtain average values. The data are described as the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments; &&p < 0.01, &&&p < 0.001 vs Control; +p <
  0.05; ++p < 0.01; +++p < 0.001 vs Model + siNC. Abbreviation: MN, membranous nephropathy;
  MSTN, myostatin; Ang II, angiotensin II; p-PKA, phosphorylated-protein kinase A;
  Nox4, NADPH oxidase 4; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siMSTN,
  small interfering RNA targeting MSTN; siNC, siRNA negative control.'
