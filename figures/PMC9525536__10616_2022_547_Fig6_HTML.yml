caption: 'Confirmation of inhibition of differentiation by different kinase inhibitors
  by surface expression marker (CD11b) analysis. The cells treated with different
  kinase inhibitors prior to addition of P3 as mentioned in Fig. , were labelled with
  (PE-cy5 conjugated anti-CD11b) at 96 h post-treatment and fluorescent cell population
  was analyzed by FACS. A Dot plot showing fluorescent cell population treated with
  P3 in the presence of different inhibitors. B The bar diagram shows the percentage
  of CD11b positive cells in P3-treated HL-60 cells in the presence of different kinase
  inhibitors. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Ordinary
  One-way ANOVA (Dunnett’s multiple comparisons) was performed to calculate the statistical
  significant difference with respect to VC in the case of P3-treated cells, whereas
  the P3-treated cells in the presence of inhibitor were compared with the cells treated
  with P3 alone. ***p ≤ 0.001; #p ≤ 0.0001'
