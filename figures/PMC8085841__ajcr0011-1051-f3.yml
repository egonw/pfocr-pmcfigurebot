caption: The roles of tumor microenvironment in lncRNAs-mediated cancer stemness and
  therapy resistance. The components of tumor microenvironment such as CAFs, MSCs
  and TAMs can secret lncRNAs in exosomes or up-regulate lncRNAs expressions in cancer
  cells. This crosstalk of tumor microenvironment and cancer cells induced metabolic
  reprogramming, Î²-catenin pathway activation, MAPK pathway activation or epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition, which confers cancer cells stemness and increased drug
  resistance.
