caption: 'Overview of the complement system and therapeutic targets. The complement
  system is comprised of soluble, membrane bound, and regulatory proteins, and may
  be activated via three distinct pathways: classical, lectin, and alternative. These
  pathways converge on the common pathway with the formation of a C3 convertase which
  splits C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b complexes to the C3 convertases to form a C5 convertase,
  which splits C5 and triggers assembly of the MAC, making up the terminal pathway.
  Complement functions include cell lysis via MAC insertion into cell membranes and
  chemotaxis and inflammation regulated by split proteins C3a and C5a. Therapeutics
  targeting several complement components have been developed, including C1 INH which
  inactivates C1s, C1r and MASP-1 and -2, thus preventing spontaneous activation of
  the classical and lectin pathways. Sutimlimab is an anti-C1s mAb approved for cold
  agglutinin disease. sCR1, and versions of this molecule such as mirococept inhibit
  C3 and C5 convertases, among other functions. Multiple C3 targeting therapeutics
  have been developed, such as compstatin and C3 siRNA. C5 and C5aR have been targeted
  by drugs such as eculizumab (anti-C5 mAb), C5aR antagonist, and C5aR siRNA.'
