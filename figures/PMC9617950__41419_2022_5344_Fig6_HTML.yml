figure_title: HADH, ACSL1, and ACAA2 as fatty acid metabolism genes that regulated
  by BRD4
caption: A Pie chart of the distribution of BRD4-bound chromatin fragments. B Analysis
  of BRD4 binding region distribution in chromatin. C Gene enrichment pathways corresponding
  to BRD4-bound chromatin fragments. D Gene enrichment analysis results of the GSH
  synthesis, iron metabolism, and lipid metabolism pathways from KEGG, Reactome, and
  WikiPathway database, respectively. E Genes involved in fatty acid metabolism pathways
  reflected in all (KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathway) databases. F Maps of HADH, ACSL1,
  and ACAA2 from KEGG pathway database. In C and D, the scatterplot is a graphical
  grouping display method based on the results of the gene enrichment analysis. GeneRatio
  refers to the ratio between the number of genes enriched in the term and the number
  of annotated genes. P. adjust refers to the p-value of each term calculated using
  the Fisher test (the probability of hypothesis test). The smaller the p-value, the
  greater the significance and the lower the misjudgment rate. In F, red boxes represent
  the metabolic steps involved in HADH, ACSL1 and ACAA2.
