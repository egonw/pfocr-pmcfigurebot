caption: 'Analysis of the mutant strain transformed with pSOScuaR. (A). Growth of
  the strains on cellobiose-containing minimal medium: wild-type (dark blue), MTLcuaD
  (red), MTLcuaD (pSOS-empty) (orange), and MTLcuaD pSOScuaR (grey). (B). Normalized
  fold expression of the genes of the cua cluster in the strain MTLcuaD pSOScuaR compared
  to mutant strain in an arabinose-containing minimal medium. (C). Western blot analyses
  of membrane fractions extracted from the wild-type strain (1), MTLcuaD strain (2),
  and MTLcuaD pSOScuaR strain (3) using antibodies targeting CuaA. Membrane fractions
  with protein amounts of 20 µg or 4 µg extracted from strains cultivated in a medium
  containing arabinose or cellobiose, respectively, were loaded on the SDS-PAGE.'
