caption: LncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 upregulation elevates NOTCH1 expression by recruiting TAF‐1
  to the NOTCH1 promoter region in GSCs. A, TAF‐1 expression in glioma tissues predicted
  in GEPIA website. B, TAF‐1 expression in glioma tissues and normal tissues determined
  by RT‐qPCR (n = 26). C, TAF‐1 expression in U251 GSCs assessed using RT‐qPCR and
  Western blot analysis. D, The binding relationship between lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 and
  TAF‐1 in U251 GSCs verified using RIP normalized to IgG. E, The binding relationship
  between lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 and TAF‐1 in U251 GSCs verified using RNA pull‐down. F,
  Binding sites between TAF‐1 and NOTCH1 predicted by GTRD website. G, Binding between
  TAF‐1 and NOTCH1 promoter determined by ChIP assay. H, NOTCH1 expression in glioma
  tissues and normal tissues assessed by RT‐qPCR and Western blot analysis (n = 26).
  I, Pearson's correlation analysis of relationship between lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 and NOTCH1
  expression (p < 0.0001, R = 0.6950), as well as between TAF‐1 and NOTCH1 expression
  (p < 0.0001, R = 0.7325). J, Targeting relationship between lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 and
  NOTCH1 promoter detected by dual‐luciferase reporter gene assay. K, Binding of TAF‐1
  and NOTCH1 after alteration of lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 evaluated by ChIP assay. L, NOTCH1
  expression in response to alteration of lncRNA FOXD2‐AS1 and silencing or overexpressed
  TAF‐1 assessed by RT‐qPCR and Western blot analysis. * p < 0.05. Measurement data
  were expressed as mean ±standard deviation. Paired t‐test was used to analyse tumour
  tissues and normal tissues. Unpaired t‐test was adopted to analyse differences of
  other two groups. Differences among multiple groups were analysed by one‐way ANOVA,
  followed by a Tukey multiple comparisons post‐test. Pearson's correlation analysis
  was used. Cell experiments were repeated in triplicate.
