figure_title: Effect of extracellular vesicle (EV)–associated miR-146a treatment on
  Ld infection
caption: '(A, B, C, D) Infected cell–derived EV treatment decreases Ld infection in
  recipient cells. (A) Parasites were labelled with CFSE dye and infection was given
  for 6 h after 24 h of control and infected cell–derived EV treatment (A, upper and
  lower panel, respectively). Parasite infection was determined by counting the CFSE
  positive structures inside cells. Scale bar 10 μm. (B) Percentage of infected cells
  was calculated for both control cell EV and infected cell EV-treated RAW264.7 cells
  (B, P = 0.0064, unpaired t test, n ≥ 16 number of fields). (C) Parasites were labelled
  with CFSE dye and infection was given for 6 h after 24 h of pCIneo and pmiR-146a–transfected
  cell–derived EV treatment. Percentage of infected cells was calculated for both
  pCIneo and pmiR-146a transfected cell–derived EV-treated cells (C, P = 0.0208, unpaired
  t test, n ≥ 18 number of fields). (D) Parasites were labelled with CFSE dye and
  infection was given for 24 h to pCIneo and pmiR-146a–transfected cell. Percentage
  of infected cells was calculated for both pCIneo and pmiR-146a transfected cells
  (P = 0.0401, unpaired t test, n ≥ 16 number of fields). (E) RAW264.7 cells were
  infected with Ld for 24 h and infection was measured in terms of amastin mRNA level
  by qRT-PCR (E, P = 0.2213, n = 4 independent experiments). (F) Relative level of
  amastin mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR from control and infected cell–derived EV-treated
  cells followed by 6 h infection (F, P = 0.0205, n = 4 independent experiments).
  (G) Relative level of amastin mRNA from pCIneo and pmiR-146a transfected cells after
  24 h of infection was determined by qRT-PCR (G, P = 0.0160, n = 4 independent experiments).
  GAPDH was used as endogenous control. Values for uninfected cell or control EV-treated
  cell or pCIneo transfected cells were considered as units. (H) RAW264.7 cells were
  co-transfected with DsRed and pmiR-146a and was infected with Ld for 24 h and infection
  level was visualized at individual cells (lower panel) and quantified (upper panel).
  Percent of infection in pmiR-146a/DsRed expressing versus non-transfected Ld-infected
  cells were measured. Scale bar 10 μm. (n = 38, Number of fields). (I, J, K, L) Latex
  bead phagocytosis after EV treatment. Red fluorescent bead (Fluorescent Red; Sigma-Aldrich)
  was diluted in medium and added to EV-treated RAW264.7 cells at 1:10 (cell:bead)
  ratio for 6 h. Red fluorescent bead was visualized by a confocal microscope. (I,
  J) Phalloidin 488 was used for staining the cytoskeleton of cells (I). Scale bar
  10 μm. Percentage of beads phagocytosed in EV-treated macrophages was plotted and
  compared between control cell EV-treated and Ld-infected cell EV-treated cells (J,
  unpaired t test, P = 0.0347, Number of fields, n ≥ 13 number of fields). (K, L)
  In panel (K) visualization of beads phagocytosed in EV-treated macrophages was monitored
  in pCIneo transfected control cell EV-treated and pmiR-146a–expressing cell EV-treated
  cells. The quantification was completed and plotted in panel L (unpaired t test,
  P = 0.6761, Number of fields, n ≥ 13 number of fields). Scale bar = 10 μm. (M) Cellular
  levels of the major signalling pathway components in pmiR-146a and pCIneo expression
  conditions were determined by Western blot. β-Actin was used as loading control.
  Data information: In all experimental data, error bars are represented as mean ±
  SEM, ns, nonsignificant, *, ** represent P-value of <0.05, <0.01, respectively.
  P-values were calculated by two-tailed paired t test in most of the experiments
  unless mentioned otherwise. Positions of molecular weight markers are marked and
  shown with the respective Western blots.'
