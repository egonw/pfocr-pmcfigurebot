caption: SMAR1 expression upon TLR agonist treatment. Western blot showing the expression
  of SMAR1 during the concentration‐dependent treatment of (A) TLR1/2 ligand, Pam3CSK4,
  (C) TLR5 ligand, Flagellin, and (E) TLR4 ligand, LPS, in HCT116 cell line. Total
  and phospho‐p65 or JNK were used as positive controls. β‐Actin was used as an endogenous
  loading control. The graphs represent the fold change relative to control, which
  was calculated after normalization with β‐actin. Real‐time quantification of SMAR1
  transcript was also carried out in a dose‐dependent manner upon (B) Pam3CSK4, (D)
  Flagellin, and (F) LPS treatment in HCT116 cell line. Relative fold change for all
  the real‐time quantitation was calculated using 18S rRNA. Confocal images representing
  the (G) time‐dependent expression of SMAR1(red) and TLR4 (green) under LPS (1 μg·mL−1)
  treatment condition. DAPI was used to stain the nucleus. The scale bar represents
  20 μm. (H) Western blot showing SMAR1 expression upon LPS treatment in different
  human colon cancer cell lines of increasing grades, human breast cancer cell line,
  MCF 7, a mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 along with a noncancerous cell line HEK293T.
  Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Error bars indicate
  that all the values are mean ± SD, where **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 (one‐way ANOVA,
  Bonferroni post‐tests).
