figure_title: Stimulation of PPP is responsible for chemoresistance in GR cells
caption: 'Relative mRNA expression levels of DHODH, UMPS, CTPS1, CTPS2, TYMS, IMPDH1,
  ADSL, ATIC, PFAS, and PRPS1 in WT and GR cells (upper: T24, lower: UMUC3). The data
  are shown as the mean values ± SEs (n = 3, biological replicates) and were analyzed
  by Student''s t‐test, and plotted relative to expression levels in WT cells. *P ≤ 0.05,
  ***P ≤ 0.001. n.s., non‐significant.Simple schematic of the glycolytic pathway and
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Glucose flux into the PPP results in increased
  nucleotide biosynthesis, including purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Mizoribine
  inhibits purine biosynthesis.The viability of WT and GR cells was evaluated by WST
  assays under treatment with gemcitabine (GEM), mizoribine, or GEM with mizoribine.
  The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates). Comparisons
  were made with respect to the corresponding controls or the indicated groups, followed
  by Student''s t‐test. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. n.s., non‐significant.Bar graph
  showing the viability of cells exposed to various concentrations of GEM for 48 h
  and treated with DMSO (GR cells) or 10 μM dC (WT cells) (left: T24 cells; right:
  UMUC3 cells). The data are shown as the mean values ± SDs (n = 3, biological replicates)
  and were analyzed by Student''s t‐test. n.s., non‐significant.'
