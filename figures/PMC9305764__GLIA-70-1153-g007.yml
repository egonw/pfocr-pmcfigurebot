caption: 'Effect of selective inhibitors of PI3K isoforms on IGF‐1 modulation of male
  astrocytic inflammatory response. PI3K pathway was blocked with isoform‐selective
  PI3K inhibitors in astrocytes treated with LPS + IGF‐1. Graphs show the expression
  of IL‐1β, IL‐6, and IL‐10 mRNA quantified by q‐RTPCR. Note that only the p110α inhibitor
  AG66 significantly suppressed the IGF‐1 effect on the IL‐6 and IL‐10 mRNA expression
  in male astrocytes, whereas TGX‐221 and CAL‐101 had no effect, suggesting that p110α
  subunit drives IGF‐1 modulation of astrocytic inflammatory response. Data are presented
  as means ± SEM. Significant differences **p < .01, effect of inhibitors versus LPS
  and #p < .05, ##p < .01 versus LPS + IGF‐1 treated groups, measured by ordinary
  one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey''s multiple comparisons post hoc test. N = 6 independent
  cultures'
