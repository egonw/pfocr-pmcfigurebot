caption: Knockdown of ARL4C inhibits migration and invasion of 786-O and ACHN cells.
  (a-b) Images were obtained using an optical microscope at 0 and 24 h after 786-O
  and ACHN cell monolayer “wounding.” (c) The degree of wound healing in the NC and
  si-ARL4C groups in ccRCC cells was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software. (d-e)
  The 786-O and ACHN cells that passed through or invaded the Transwell filter were
  stained and photographed using an inverted microscope. (f-g) The number of migrating
  and invading cells in the NC and si-ARL4C groups in ccRCC cells was calculated using
  Image-Pro Plus software and represented as histograms. ∗∗∗P < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗P <
  0.0001.
