figure_title: Fig. 3 |. Positional identity gene programmes determine the response
  to CRKL
caption: a, Schematic illustrating the fin versus body RNA-seq experiment. Body skin
  and fins were isolated from WT and acral melanoma fish by dissection and then sorted
  by FACS for GFP+ melanocytes and GFP− surrounding cells. TME, tumour microenvironment.
  b, Unsupervised clustering using the 500 most variable genes across all samples,
  clustered by cell lineage, anatomic position and then genotype. c, Waterfall plot
  representation of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) pathway analysis of WT fin
  melanocytes versus body melanocytes, showing the top 2,500 enriched pathways and
  highlighting pathways related to limb development and positional identity. Limb
  development pathways were identified using the search terms ‘limb’ or ‘appendage’.
  Pathways related to positional identity were identified using the search terms ‘morphogenesis’,
  ‘pattern’ and ‘regionalization’. Only pathways with FDR < 0.05 are highlighted.
  The specific pathways highlighted in the plot are shown in , . d, Heat map representing
  expression of transgenes, melanocyte markers and hox genes across all samples.
