figure_title: Recurrent alterations affecting genes in the canonical Hippo signaling
  pathway in clear cell carcinomas of the cervix
caption: (A) Micrographs of representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) sections
  of clear cell carcinoma of the cervix (scale bar 50 Âµm). (B) Heatmap depicting non-synonymous
  somatic mutations, amplifications and homozygous deletions identified in cCCCs subjected
  to MSK-IMPACT (n=15) or whole-exome sequencing (WES; n=5). Cases are shown in columns
  and genes in rows. Genetic alterations are color-coded according to the legend.
  Clinical stage is depicted in the phenotype bar (top). (C) Lollipop plots depicting
  the frequency of YAP1 S61W (top) and WWTR1 S89W (middle) mutations in cCCCs, including
  the protein domains of each gene. TEAD BD, TEAD binding domain; CC, coiled-coil
  region. Copy number plot of the cCCC5T harboring a WWTR1 amplification (bottom).
  The Log2-ratios are plotted on the y-axis according to genomic positions (x-axis).
  Chromosomes are depicted by alternating blue and red bands. (D) Frequency of activating
  (red) or repressing (blue) somatic genetic alterations affecting genes in the canonical
  Hippo signaling pathway. The percentage of cCCCs harboring a somatic mutation or
  gene copy number alteration is depicted under the gene name. Pathway reported in
  Sanchez-Vega et al [].
