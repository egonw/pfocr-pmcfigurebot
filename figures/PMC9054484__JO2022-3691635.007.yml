caption: BCKDK promotes tumorigenesis through upregulating MEK-ERK signaling pathway.
  (a) Bubble chart of KEGG pathway analysis figured out the MAPK pathway associated
  with BCKDK expression. (b and c) The level of phosphorylation of MEKs and ERKs was
  increased in SKOV3/OVCAR3-BCKDK cells after EGF treatment for 15 min. (d) The level
  of phosphorylation of MEKs and ERKs was decreased in HO8910-PM-shBCKDK cells after
  EGF treatment for 15 min. (e) The level of phosphorylation of MEKs and ERKs was
  decreased in the tumor tissues from HO8910-PM-shBCKDK-injected mice compared to
  HO8910-PM-shMock-injected mice. (f) BCKDK binds with MEK in HO8910-PM cells. Endogenous
  BCKDK or MEK was immunoprecipitated from HO8910-PM cells and then probed with anti-MEK
  or anti-BCKDK antibody. All western blot data are representatives of results from
  triplicate experiments. (g) The signaling pathway of BCKDK in cancers [–].
