caption: 'Progesterone and 17OHP were identified as novel ligands of GPR126 through
  steroid hormones screening. (A) Heatmap representing the cAMP accumulation (Left)
  or inhibition ratio (Right) induced by steroid hormones (100 μM) in GPR126-overexpressing
  HEK293 cells using GloSensor assay. The red color scale indicates the steroid ligands-cAMP
  accumulation efficacy level (Emax value ratio) via GPR126 with Stachel-mimicking
  peptide (126-SMP) as positive control and the blue color indicates steroid ligands-cAMP
  inhibition efficacy level (Emax value ratio) with 5 μM Fsk-stimulated via GPR126.
  The values are generated according to the data shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A–E
  and G–L. (B) Chemical structures of the identified GPR126 ligands: progesterone
  and 17OHP. (D and E) Representative dose–response curves that progesterone (C) and
  17OHP (D) induced cAMP inhibition in control and GPR126-overexpressing HEK293 cells
  treated with DMSO or Gi inhibitor PTX (100 ng/mL) using a GloSensor assay.'
