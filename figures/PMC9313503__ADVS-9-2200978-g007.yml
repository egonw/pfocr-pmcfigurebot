caption: SOCS1 inhibited T cell activation by inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation. A)
  RNA‐seq volcano plots comparing gene expression between Socs1‐specific knockout
  T cells and T cells from WT mice (n = 3). B) Gene pathway enrichment analysis for
  the upregulated genes in Socs1 deficiency T cells. C) Western blot analysis of STAT3
  and phosphorylated STAT3 levels in the SOCS1‐overexpressing Jurkat T cell line.
  D) Western blot analysis of STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 levels in the splenic
  T cell from Socs1 cKO or WT mice. E) Flow cytometric analysis of the phosphorylated
  STAT3 levels in SOCS1 mimetic (KIR) or PBS treated primary T cells. n = 4. F) Flow
  cytometric analysis of the Ki67 levels in SOCS1 mimetic (KIR) or PBS‐treated primary
  T cells. n = 4. Error bars represent the mean ± SEM, ***p < 0.001.
