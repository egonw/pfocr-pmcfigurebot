caption: 'Functional requirement of NOergic signaling and nNOSVMH neurons for the
  control of female sexual behavior. (A–C) Lordosis, mild rejection, and severe rejection
  quotients following the administration of 8 mg/kg SNAP 15 min before the behavioral
  test in control (n = 11) and PAMH (n = 8) female mice. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  posthoc test. (D–F) Lordosis, mild rejection, and severe rejection quotients following
  the administration of 15 mg/kg sildenafil citrate 1 h before the behavioral test
  in control (n = 6) and PAMH (n = 10) female mice. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s posthoc
  test. (G) Schematic shows strategy for selective expression of AAV9-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry
  targeted to nNOSVMH neurons in Nos1cre/+ female mice. (H–O) Representative confocal
  images show viral transfection in the VMH of Nos1cre/+ female mice. Images show
  nNOS (H), mCherry (I), nuclear marker DAPI (J), and colocalization immunoreactivity
  in the nucleus. (L–O) depict high-magnification images from (H–K), respectively,
  representing the area shown within the white dashed box in K . Full yellow arrows
  show examples of colocalization between nNOS and mCherry immunoreactivity, whereas
  hollow yellow arrows point to mCherry expression only. (P–R) Lordosis, mild rejection,
  and severe rejection quotients following chemogenetic inhibition of nNOSVMH neurons
  in female mice. Acute chemogenetic manipulation with 3 mg/kg CNO promotes sexual
  dysfunction and enhanced sexual rejection in Nos1cre/+ female mice (n = 10). Wilcoxon
  signed-rank test; **P < 0.01. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Different letters
  indicate statistically significant differences. Scale bars: H-K, 100 µm; L-O, 30
  µm.'
