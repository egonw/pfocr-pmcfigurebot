caption: 'CFHR3 downregulation promotes HCC cell malignant phenotypes. (A, B) GSEA
  plots show enrichment of gene signatures associated with the liver cancer proliferation
  and metastasis in HCC tissues with a CFHR3 high as compared with a CFHR3 low (A,
  Chiang Liver Cancer Subclass Proliferation Up; B, Roessler Liver Cancer Metastasis
  Up). (C) CFHR3 protein levels in five HCC cell lines and normal liver cells (MIHA)
  were determined by western blot. (D) CFHR3 knockdown efficiency was validated by
  western blot in HepG2 and Hep3B cells, respectively. (E, F) Cell growth of CFHR3-knockdown
  HepG2 (E) and Hep3B (F) cells and negative control (NTC) cells were determined,
  respectively. (G–L) Migration and invasion of CFHR3-knockdown HepG2 (G–I) and Hep3B
  (J–L) cells and NTC cells were determined, respectively. (Remarks: * represents
  P < 0.05; ** represents P < 0.01; Data are presented as mean ± SD).'
