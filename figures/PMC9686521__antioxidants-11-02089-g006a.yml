caption: Treatment with narcissoside (NCS) raises the amount of nuclear factor erythroid
  2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the nucleus of SH-SY5Y cells to enhance the transcriptional
  activity initiated by binding of the antioxidant response element (ARE). (A) Cells
  were incubated with 1-μM NCS for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9h. Nuclear Nrf1 and Nrf2 was
  determined by Western blotting. PARP was used as the internal loading control. (B,C)
  Cells were transfected with the ARE reporter plasmid for 24 h and then treated with
  1 μM NCS for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 h (B) or treated 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μM NCS
  for 5 h (C). Luciferase activities were determined by Luciferase assay kit. (D)
  Electromobility gel shift assay (EMSA) was used to quantify the ARE binding activity
  of nuclear extracts (Nrf2) from (A). Unlabeled double-stranded ARE oligonucleotide
  (200 ng, cold competitors) was used to confirm the specific binding.
