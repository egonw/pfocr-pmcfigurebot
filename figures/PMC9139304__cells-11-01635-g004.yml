caption: 'The anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody does not induce activation in total RAW
  cells. (A) Immunoblot evaluation of proteins involved in the CD3 signaling pathway;
  NFAT, phosphorylated C-Jun (pC-Jun), IKK-α, NF-κB and phosphorylated CD3-ζ chain
  (pCD3-ζ), β-Tubulin as loading control in lysates of RAW cells cultured for 24 h
  under the following conditions: RPMI (control), anti-CD3 (stimulus), and isotype
  control. Relative units (R.U) of NFAT, pC-Jun, IKK-α, NF-κB, and pCD3-ζ in RAW cell
  lysates ((B–F), respectively). Levels of TNF and IL-6 were measured in supernatants
  collected from total RAW cells by ELISA sandwich assay ((G,H), respectively). n
  = 5 independent experiments (immunoblot) and n = 5 independent experiments performed
  in triplicate (ELISA). Bars represent the mean value ± SD (B–F) or the mean of means
  ± SEM (G,H). Kruskal–Wallis and corrected for the Dunn test were used for immunoblot
  data and one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test for ELISA. * p < 0.05.'
