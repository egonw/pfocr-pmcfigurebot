caption: 'Effect of miR-372-3p KD on the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway. (a) Protein
  expressions of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, P70S6K, and p-P70S6K HIF-1α
  in the control, model, and miR-372-3p KD groups were identified by Western blotting.
  β-Actin was considered as a loading control. (b) Statistical analysis was performed
  to examine the expressions of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, P70S6K, p-P70S6K,
  and HIF-1α in myocardial tissues. (c) Protein expressions of NOX2 and NOX4 in the
  control, model, and miR-372-3p KD groups were identified by Western blotting. β-Actin
  was considered as a loading control. (d) Statistical analysis was performed to examine
  the expressions of NOX2 and NOX4 in myocardial tissues. Data were presented as means
  ± SEM, n = 4/group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01: model group vs. miR-372-3p KD group.'
