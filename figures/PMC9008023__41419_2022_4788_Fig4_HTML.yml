figure_title: CLDN4 can regulate NF-κB activity induced by TNF-α
caption: A According to GSEA, the high expression of CLDN4 in the TNF-α signaling
  via NF-κB pathway was enhanced from CGGA-693 data set. B NF-κB P65 and p-NF-κB P65
  expression were determined by western blotting. C NF-κB p65, p-NF-κB P65, IκBα,
  p-IκBα, IKKβ and p-IKKβ were determined by western blotting. D Western blotting
  analysis of EMT markers in GBM cells. E, F Invasion ability was determined by Transwell
  assay. Representative images of three cases were shown. Data are represented as
  the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. Student’s t-test,
  compared to the Control group. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
