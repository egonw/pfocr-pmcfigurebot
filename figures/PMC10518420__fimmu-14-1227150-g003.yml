caption: Functions of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived exosomal circRNAs on
  immune cells in the TME. Exosomal circRNAs reprogram the biological behavior of
  various immune cells. (A) HCC-derived exosomal circ-0074854 was delivered to macrophages
  to induce pro-tumorigenic cell polarization toward the M2 phenotype. It also interacts
  with human antigen R (HuR) to promote HCC migration and invasion through the zinc
  finger E-box binding homeobox 1/epithelial–mesenchymal transition (ZEB1/EMT) pathway.
  (B) HCC-derived exosomal transmembrane protein 181 circRNA (circTMEM181) acts as
  a sponge for microRNA 488-3p (miR-488-3p) and up-regulates CD39 expression in macrophages,
  acting synergistically with CD73 to activate the extracellular adenosine triphosphate
  (eATP)–adenosine pathway in HCC cells, producing excessive quantities of adenosine
  that impair T cell function. (C) HCC derived exosomal Gse1 coiled coil protein circRNA
  (circGSE1) induces the amplification of regulatory T cells (Tregs) via the miR-324-5p/transforming
  growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1)/SMAD family member 3 (Smad3) axis. (D) HCC
  derived exosomal circUHRF1 is delivered to NKs, triggers NKs exhaustion via the
  miR-449c-5p/TIM3 pathway, and inhibits IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion.
