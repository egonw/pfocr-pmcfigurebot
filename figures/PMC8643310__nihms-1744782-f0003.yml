figure_title: Paclitaxel activates cGAS signaling in triple-negative breast cancer
  cell lines
caption: (A) ELISA analysis of 2’3’-cGAMP production in wild type and cGAS knockout
  MDA-MB-231 four days after exposure to 10 nM paclitaxel. N=3 independent experiments.
  Mean and SEM are plotted. P values were calculated by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
  test with control as 0 day (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns=not significant).(B)
  Representative immunoblot of MDA-MB-231 wild type cells exposed to 10 nM paclitaxel
  after 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 days probed with phosphoproteins downstream of the STING
  pathway that increase with activation of the pathway comprising pTBK1, pSTING, pIRF3
  and pSTAT1.(C) Representative immunoblot of cGAS, STING and pIRF3 from MDA-MB-231
  wild type (WT) and cGAS knockout (KO) cells exposed to 10 nM paclitaxel for four
  days. Alpha tubulin serves as the loading control.(D) Representative immunoblot
  of cGAS and pIRF3 from MDA-MB-436 wild type (WT) and siRNA-mediated cGAS knockdown
  (KD) cells exposed to 10 nM paclitaxel for four days. Alpha tubulin serves as the
  loading control.(E) Interferon-beta measurements of wild type (WT) and cGAS knockout
  (KO) MDA-MB-231 exposed to no treatment (UNT) or 10 nM paclitaxel (PAX) over five
  days. N=2 independent experiments. Mean and SEM are plotted. P values were calculated
  by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns=not
  significant).(F) Interferon-beta measurements of MDA-MB-436 wild type (WT) and siRNA-mediated
  cGAS knockdown (KD) exposed to no treatment (UNT) or 10 nM paclitaxel (PAX) over
  five days. N=2 independent experiments. Mean and SEM are plotted. P values were
  calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001, ns=not significant).
