caption: 'Forkhead Box q1 regulates epidermal growth factor receptor and downstream
  signaling pathways by regulating heparin binding epidermal growth factor. A: Quantitative
  real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) was performed to analyze the levels
  of forkhead Box q1 (FOXQ1), heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), Akt, kRas and Raf in DLD1-shFOXQ1 and DLD1-shControl
  cells; B: qRT–PCR was performed to analyze the levels of FOXQ1, HB-EGF, EGFR, AKT,
  RAF and KRAS in SW480-shFOXQ1 and SW480-shControl cells; C: Western blot analyses
  were performed to analyze the protein levels of FOXQ1, HB-EGF, EGFR, RAF and KRAS
  as well as the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and MAPK in DLD1-shFOXQ1, SW480-shFOXQ1,
  DLD1-shControl and SW480-shControl cells. β-actin was used as the loading control;
  D: Exogenous rhHB-EGF (50 ng/mL) was added to the culture media of DLD1-shFOXQ1
  and SW480-shFOXQ1 cells for 1.5 h and 2 h, respectively. Western blotting was performed
  to detect the expression of proteins in the HB-EGF/EGFR signaling pathway. aP <
  0.05; bP < 0.01; cP < 0.001 indicate significant differences compared to the control
  group (two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test). Bars represent the mean ± S.E. of
  three independent experiments. rhHB-EGF: Recombinant human HB-EGF; FOXQ1: Forkhead
  Box q1; HB-EGF: Heparin binding epidermal growth factor.'
