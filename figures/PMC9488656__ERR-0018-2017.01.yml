caption: Proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Proteins enter the ER and
  rapidly associate with chaperones such as binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP).
  Once correctly folded, proteins continue along the secretory pathway via the Golgi
  apparatus. Proteins that fail to fold correctly are retained in the ER and eventually
  targeted for proteasomal degradation by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The threatened
  accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates the unfolded protein response
  (UPR) via inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE)1, ATF6 and PERK. IRE1 initiates splicing
  of mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP1; ATF6 activation leads to its proteolytic
  processing in the Golgi apparatus and the release of a soluble transcription factor
  domain. Both XBP1 and cleaved ATF6 upregulate components of the ER folding and degradation
  machineries. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α to inhibit most translation, but
  increases the translation of ATF4. Targets of ATF4 promote oxidative folding, amino
  acid synthesis and recovery of normal translation rates. In addition, IRE1 reduces
  translation during stress, by degrading ER-localised mRNAs in a process termed regulated
  IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). Reproduced and modified from [] with permission.
