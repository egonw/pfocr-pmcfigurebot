caption: Effects of TIIA on LX-2 cell viability. The viability of LX-2 cells was determined
  using MTS. TIIA had no significant cytotoxic effect at 10, 20, 40 and 80 µmol/l
  whereas a significant cytotoxic effect at 160 and 320 µmol/l was observed. **P<0.01
  vs. control (n=6). TIIA, tanshinone IIA.
