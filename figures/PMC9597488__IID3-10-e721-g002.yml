caption: Nociceptive effects of the GR agonist Dexamethasone (Dexa) and MR antagonist
  potassium canrenoate (Cane) and their combination. (A and B) Dose‐effect curves
  of Dexa or Cane alone showed that the median effective dose (ED50) ratio was 73.38 μg
  and 295.62 μg, respectively. (C and D) Dose‐effect curves of Dexa and Cane in combination
  showed a rightward shift. (E) Isobologram analysis demonstrated that the point representing
  the ED50 of the combination of Dexa/Cane (red) was outside the line connecting the
  ED50 of Dexa alone (green) and Cane (blue), indicating a sub‐additive interaction
  of both drugs. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 6). Statistical analysis was
  conducted using Linear regression. GR, glucocorticoid receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid
  receptor.
