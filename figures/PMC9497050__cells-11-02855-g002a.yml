caption: 'MYH9 contributed to radioresistance in cancer cells. (A,B) Transfection
  of MYH9-shRNA increased radiosensitivity in OECM-1 (A) and Detroit 562 (B) cells,
  as determined by clonogenic survival assay. (C) Significant increases of anti-apoptotic
  and DNA repair-associated gene expressions in the tumor samples compared to normal
  samples. The gene expression data, including XIAP, MCL1, BCL2L1, ATM, RAD50, and
  NBN, were retrieved from the TCGA-HNSC dataset. (D) Correlative expressions between
  MYH9 and anti-apoptotic and DNA repair associated molecules XIAP, MCL1, BCL2L1,
  ATM, RAD50, and NBN, in the HNC tumor samples. The gene expression data were retrieved
  from the TCGA-HNSC dataset. All the experiments were performed at least three times
  independently, and a typical result was shown. The error bars shown in the relevant
  figures indicated the standard deviation of the quantification results in all experiments.
