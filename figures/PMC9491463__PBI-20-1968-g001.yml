caption: Investigating putrescine metabolism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. (a) Schematic
  of the putrescine metabolic network originating from the incorporation of inorganic
  carbon and nitrogen, leading to glutamate formation. Dashed lines indicate vestigial
  or hypothetic reactions. Multiple consecutive reactions are summarized by two or
  more arrows. An orthogonal bar at the end of a connection symbolizes direct (solid
  line) or indirect (dotted lines) feedback inhibition. (b) Effect of extracellular
  putrescine on cell growth, summarized as growth rate inhibition (GR value) of spiked
  UVM4 cultures normalized to the untreated control after 3 days. (c) Cellular putrescine
  levels during the early stationary growth phase in the N‐UVM4 strain compared to
  those in ΔODC1 and ΔODC2 knockout mutants. Error bars represent the standard deviation
  of biological replicates. Asterisks (*) indicate the significance level of an unpaired,
  two‐sided Student's t‐test assuming non‐homogenous variances (*P < 0.05). TCA cycle,
