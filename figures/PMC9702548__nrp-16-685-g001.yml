figure_title: Effect of PGE and HFPGE on the viability of RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were
  seeded at density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated in DMEM
  supplemented with 100 mL/L FBS. After 24 h, cells were treated with varying concentrations
  of PGE (A) and HFPGE (B), and incubated for 48 h. Cell viability was determined
  by the MTT assay. Each bar expresses the mean ± SEM (n = 6). Means without the same
  letter differ, P < 0.05
caption: DMEM, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
  tetrazolium bromide; PGE, Platycodon grandiflorum extract; HFPGE, hydrolyzed and
  fermented Platycodon grandiflorum extract.
article_title: Immunostimulatory activity of hydrolyzed and fermented Platycodon grandiflorum
  extract occurs via the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.
