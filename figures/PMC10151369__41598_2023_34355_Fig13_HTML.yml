caption: The proposed mechanism of action of DMA in neuroinflammation and AD. Stimulated
  pattern recognition receptors in microglia activate the NF-κB pathway, leading to
  degradation of IκBα and translocation of NF-κB p65 into the nucleus to trigger inflammatory
  responses and upregulation of Aβ. Increased levels of Aβ exacerbate NF- κB pathway
  activation and inflammation, producing a feed-forward loop. DMA suppresses IκBα
  degradation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, which attenuates neuroinflammation.
