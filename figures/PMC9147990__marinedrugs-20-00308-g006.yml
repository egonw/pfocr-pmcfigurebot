caption: 'PWG inhibits NFκB signaling pathway in UVB-irradiated HDFs. HDFs were irradiated
  with UVB (20 mJ/cm2), followed by treatment with 50, 100, and 200 µg/mL of PWG.
  Protein expression of IKBα (B), and NFκB (C,D) in the nucleus and cytoplasm were
  determined by western blot (A). All data were indicated as mean ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments. # p < 0.05 versus normal, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
  versus UVB-irradiated cells.'

  Dermal Fibroblasts.
