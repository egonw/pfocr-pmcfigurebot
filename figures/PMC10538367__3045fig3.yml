caption: Biological processes including type I IFN signaling and T cell–mediated immune
  responses are associated with NR1D1. A, Heat map of differentially expressed genes
  (|FC| ≥ 2 and P < 0.05) in the mammary gland tumors between 14-week-old Nr1d1 WT;PyMT
  and Nr1d1 KO;PyMT mice using RNA-seq data. B, Volcano plot of differentially expressed
  genes. Red and blue dots show upregulated and downregulated genes in Nr1d1 KO;PyMT
  mice, respectively. C, GSEA showing the top 10 enriched biological processes in
  Nr1d1 WT;PyMT mammary tumors compared with Nr1d1 KO;PyMT mammary tumors based on
  normalized enrichment score. The number of annotated genes in each ontology is shown
  at the right side of the bar. D, GSEA enrichment plots of representative gene sets
  positively correlated with Nr1d1 WT;PyMT mammary tumors (vs. Nr1d1 KO;PyMT mammary
  tumors). E, MDA-MB-231 control or NR1D1 KO cells were treated with 200 μmol/L H2O2
  for 72 hours. RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis. Heat map of
  differentially expressed genes (|FC| ≥ 1.5 and P < 0.05) is shown. F, DAVID Gene
  Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes showing top 7 downregulated
  biological process in NR1D1 KO cells compared with control cells based on P value.
  The number of annotated genes in each ontology is shown at the right side of the
  bar. G, An interaction network of differentially expressed genes obtained by the
  STRING database. Genes included in GOBP of “type I IFN signaling pathway” and “regulation
  of T-cell activation,” and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
  of “cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway” are colored.
