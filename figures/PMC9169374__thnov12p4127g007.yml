caption: EPHA2 is an indicator of poor prognosis and progression in breast cancer.
  A Patients with high EPHA2 expression showed a lower survival rate in BRCA in the
  TCGA database. B TCGA data analysis suggested that EPHA2 expression was positively
  correlated with angiogenesis-related genes in BRCA. C The expression level of EPHA2
  was higher in drug-resistant tissues in BRCA in the TCGA database. D Immunohistochemical
  staining to examine the expression of EPHA2 in a breast cancer tissue microarray.
  E Immunohistochemical staining to examine the expression of CD31 in a breast cancer
  tissue microarray. F The percentage score of EPHA2 in the paracancer group (Control),
  nonmetastatic group and metastatic group. G The number of CD31-stained microvesicles
  in the paracancer group (Control), nonmetastatic group and metastatic group. H The
  number of CD31-stained microvesicles in EPHA2 low expression and high expression
  tissues. I ELISA assays showed the concentration of exosomal EPHA2 in plasma collected
  from healthy donors (n=25), breast cancer patients without metastasis (n=25), or
  breast cancer patients with metastasis (n=25). Data are shown as mean Â± SD. Statistical
  analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and
  ns P > 0.05 indicate no statistical significance.

  angiogenesis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway through Ephrin A1-EPHA2 forward
  signaling.
