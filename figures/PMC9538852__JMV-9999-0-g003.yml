caption: SW0123 vaccination maintains endothelial barrier function post‐SARS‐CoV‐2
  infection. (A) UMAP plots displaying endothelial cell clusters in rhesus macaques
  with SW0123 vaccination or PBS administration infected by SARS‐CoV‐2. (B) Violin
  plot showing scoring of CDH5 gene in endothelial cells between SW0123 vaccination
  and PBS administration in rhesus macaques. (C) KEGG pathway analysis of the participation
  of DEGs in indicated signaling pathways from BALF in rhesus macaques with SW0123
  vaccination or PBS administration. (D) Violin plot showing scoring of SELP and VCAM1
  genes in endothelial cells between SW0123 vaccination and PBS administration in
  rhesus macaques. (E) KEGG pathway analysis of the participation of DEGs in inflammation‐related
  signaling pathways from endothelial cells between SW0123 vaccination and PBS treatment
  in rhesus macaques. (F) Representative images of immunofluorescence staining of
  CD31 and TUNEL in endothelial cells from rhesus macaques with SW0123 vaccination
  or PBS administration upon SARS‐CoV‐2 challenge. DEGs, differentially expressed
  genes; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus‐2; UMAP, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection.
