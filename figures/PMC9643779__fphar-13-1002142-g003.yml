caption: 'The interaction between apoptosis and autophagy. (A) The viability of hepatocytes
  was analyzed by MTT after L02 cells were incubated with 5, 10, 15 μM Sunitinib for
  48 h in the presence or absence of 20 μM CQ pretreatment for 2 h (n = 6). (B) Levels
  of ALT, AST, and LDH released into the supernatant after L02 cells were incubated
  with 10 μM Sunitinib for 48 h in the presence or absence of 20 μM CQ pretreatment
  for 2 h (n = 3). (C) Protein expression of PARP, c-Caspase3, P62, and LC3B (n =
  3). (D) Protein expression of LC3B after L02 cells were incubated with 10 μM Sunitinib
  for 48 h in the presence or absence of 25 μM Z-VAD-FMK pretreatment for 2 h (n =
  3). **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. Control group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p
  < 0.001 vs. Sunitinib group.'
