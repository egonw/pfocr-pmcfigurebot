caption: 6OHDA triggered caspase-4 activity in dDCNs. (A) A 68% cell survival was
  determined in 6OHDA+ salubrinal-treated dDCNs, showing that 6OHDA triggered the
  PERK pathway. A 60% cell survival was measured in 6OHDA+zLEVDfmk-treated dDCNs,
  demonstrating 6OHDA-induced stress triggered caspase-4 activation in dDCNs. A further
  77% survival of 6OHDA+salubrinal + zLEVDfmk-treated dDCNs, indicates that the PERK
  pathway does not influence caspase-4 activation in dDCNs. zLEVDfmk in combination
  with salubrinal promoted further survival of 6OHDA-treated dDCNs, indicating an
  additional benefit of targeting the ER stress pathway and caspase-4. The proportion
  of cells surviving was determined by MTT absorbance at 570 nm. Means of three experiments
  ± SEM is shown (B). Illustrative example of GAPDH and caspase-4 in control, salubrinal,
  6OHDA and salubrinal+6OHDA-treated dDCNs (C). Quantitatively, a 67% increase in
  caspase-4 was detected in 6OHDA-treated dDCNs compared to control dDCNs (p < 0.05).
  Salubrinal did not show any effect on the amount of caspase-4 in salubrinal-treated
  and 6OHDA+salubrinal-treated dDCNs (p > 0.05). Means of five experiments ± SEM is
  shown. A table of values and statistical analysis can be found in  for (A,C), respectively.
