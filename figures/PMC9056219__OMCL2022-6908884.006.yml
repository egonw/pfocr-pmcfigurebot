caption: 'EDA attenuated PM-induced activation of NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. (a)
  HBECs were treated with 500 μM EDA and then stimulated with 300 μg/mL PM for 24 h.
  The phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway was detected by western blot.
  The optical densities of phospho-NF-κB p65 are shown in (b). (c) Mice were intratracheally
  instilled with PM at 100 μg/day/mouse for 2 consecutive days. EDA (2, 10, or 20 mg/kg)
  was intraperitoneally injected prior to PM exposure for 1 h. The phosphorylation
  of NF-κB p65 in lung tissues was detected by western blot. The optical densities
  of phospho-NF-κB p65 are shown in (d). (e) The transfection efficiency of NF-κB
  siRNA was detected by RT-PCR. (f) The protein level of NF-κB was tested by western
  blot in HBECs which were transfected with NF-κB siRNA with or without PM exposure.
  The optical densities of phospho-NF-κB p65 are shown in (g). (h) The mRNA level
  of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-1β was detected by RT-PCR. ∗P < 0.05
  or ∗∗P < 0.01, compared with the control group; #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01, compared
  with the PM group; n = 3 or 5. EDA: edaravone; PM: particulate matter; HBECs: human
  bronchial epithelial cells.'
