caption: miR-9-5p promoted osteogenic differentiation through the ERK signaling pathway.
  (A-B) The mineralization of hBMSCs pretreated with or without ERK specific inhibitor
  PD98059 for 24 hr with miR-9-5p inhibitor was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining
  and ALP activity. (C-D) The osteogenesis-related gene expression (including ALP,
  OPN and OCN) of hBMSCs pretreated with or without ERK specific inhibitor PD98059
  for 24 hr with miR-9-5p inhibitor was measured by qRT-PCR (C) and western blot (D)
  assays. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs anti-miR-9-5p group.
