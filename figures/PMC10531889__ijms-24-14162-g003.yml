caption: 'KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of common genes and mRNA expression levels
  of carcinomatous-related factors. (A) Common genes of the three DEGs in  shown as
  a Venn diagram. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the common genes. The symbol
  ↑ highlighted in red indicates an increase in ranking position. (C) Relative mRNA
  expression of PDGFRA, TIMP3, and ADCY1 in liver tissue. Data are presented as the
  means ± SEM. * and ** denote p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 in comparison to the control
  group (C); # and ## denote p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 in comparison to the nano-DEN group
  (M).'
