caption: 'Confirmation of the activation of the cGAS/STING pathway for radiation therapy
  plus IRIN when delivered by a silicasome nanocarrier (A)The scheme of IRIN silicasome
  nanocarrier. (B) Representative transmission electron microscopic images of IRIN
  silicasomes. The negative staining showed the uniform lipids coating on the MSNP.
  Bar: 200 nm (left); 100 nm (right). The particle morphology, hydrodynamic size,
  polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, and loading capacity were shown. (C)
  IC50 curves. HCT8 cells were treated with different concentrations of free IRIN
  and IRIN silicasome for 48 h. The cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay. Each
  point represents the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. IC50 was calculated
  with the nonlinear regression analysis by GraphPad Prism software. (D) Western blot
  analysis was conducted to measure the effects of free IRIN and IRIN silicasome on
  the activation of the cGAS/STING pathway in MC38 cells. ImageJ software was used
  to determine protein levels normalized to the tublin band.'
