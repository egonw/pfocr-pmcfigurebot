figure_title: Glutathione biosynthesis affects chemotherapy response
caption: a–f Relative survival of MiaPaCa-2 cells (a, c, e) and KPC cells (b, d, f)
  at the indicated conditions for five days. For experiments under low glucose conditions,
  cells were cultured in reduced glucose media for 30 hours prior to chemotherapy
  treatment. GSH (reduced glutathione, 4 mM), NAC (N-acetylcysteine, 1.5 mM), or BSO
  (L-Buthionine sulfoximine, at indicated concentration) was co-administered with
  chemotherapy (n = 3 independent experiments). g Survival of C57BL/6 J mice bearing
  KPC orthotopic tumors with the indicated treatments. The number of mice per group
  is indicated. h Depiction of the de novo glutathione synthesis pathway and the effects
  of glucose limitation and chemotherapy on cancer death. Survival distributions were
  estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimation and compared by log-rank tests (g). Data
  are provided as mean ± s.d. (a–f). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
