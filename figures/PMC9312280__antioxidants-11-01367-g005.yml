caption: 'Effects of PKLPs on the protein expression of the Nrf2 signaling pathway:
  (a) Western blotting estimation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway protein expression
  in Caco-2 cells after pre-treatment with catechin (75 μg/mL) and PKLPs (50 μg/mL)
  for 24 h before stimulation with H2O2 (200 μM/L) for 2 h; (b–g) Quantification of
  the above-mentioned Western blots, using β-actin as a loading control. The results
  are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). Columns marked with different lowercase letters
  indicate the significant differences among treatments by using Duncan analysis (p
  < 0.05).'
