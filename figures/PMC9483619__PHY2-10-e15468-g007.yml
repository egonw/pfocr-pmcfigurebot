caption: p‐JAK2 protein expression in kidney tissue. (a) Immunohistochemical staining
  for phosphorylated JAK2Y1007+Y1008 (P‐JAK2) protein in tubules. (b) Immunostaining
  for p‐JAK2 in renal corpuscles. Relative ODs were quantified for 10 non‐overlapping
  fields of tubular and 10 non‐overlapping fields of renal corpuscle sections for
  each kidney. OD data were quantified (n = 3 mice/group) and analyzed by two‐way
  ANOVA. a–c Mean values with different letters are significantly different (p < 0.01).
  (c) Immunolocalization for p‐JAK2 (red) in kidney tubules. Meprin β (green) and
  villin (green) were used as PT biomarkers in WT and βKO respectively. There were
  significant increases in p‐JAK2 levels in PTs in both genotypes and in renal corpuscle
  of βKO kidneys only.
