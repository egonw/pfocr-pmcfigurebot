caption: Fatty acid β-oxidation, fatty acids, and their carnitines. The levels of
  (A) octanoate, (B) decanoate, (C) octanoylcarnitine, (D) decanoylcarnitine, (E)
  laurate, (F) myristate, (G) palmitate, (H) stearate, (I) lauroylcarnitine, (J) myristoylcarnitine,
  (K) palmitoylcarnitine, and (L) stearoylcarnitine in PWH before and after ART compared
  with HIVSN. Scatter plots show the mean and significance notations of adjusted p-values
  (95% CI) at * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001, and **** = p < 0.0001.
  For multiple group comparisons, Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests were performed
  in combination with Games-Howell multiple comparisons correction for sample sizes
  >50 with a 95% confidence interval. (M) Diagrammatic representation of metabolic
  pathways modified by HIV and ART. In pre-ART HIV blue text indicates CoA conjugate,
  enzyme, and pathway names; black text indicates no change; red text indicates significantly
  increased levels; and aqua text indicates significantly decreased levels compared
  with HIVSN. Solid line up-arrows (↑) indicate significantly increased and solid
  line down-arrows (↓) indicate significantly decreased levels following ART compared
  with pre-ART HIV.
