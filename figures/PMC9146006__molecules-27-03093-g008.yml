caption: PWE improved the expressions of occludin and ZO-1 by JNK signaling. (A) Target
  protein expressions in mice colon. (B) Phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinases/c-Jun
  N-terminal kinases (p-JNK/JNK), (C) zonula occludens-1/β-actin (ZO-1/β-actin), (D)
  occludin/β-actin. Data are expressed as the means ± SE (n = 8). Bars with different
  letters are significantly different (p < 0.05).
