caption: Pigs subjected to stimulation of immune system experience increased production
  of acute-phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin,
  and pig-MAP). Additionally, there is a marked syntheses of endogenous antioxidants
  to mitigate oxidative stress, including the production of immune-signaling compounds,
  the release of superoxide dismutase by phagocytic cells and the increased turnover
  of glutathione, which is a key, non-enzyme antioxidant in the body. Furthermore,
  a higher concentration of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines decreases the contractility
  of gastrointestinal smooth muscle, thereby reducing its motility and sparing energy
  and nutrient expenditure for digestion. In attempt to minimize metabolic costs,
  pigs mobilize nutrients, particularly amino acids, from body reserves. This is mediated
  by proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, which stimulate the IκB/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, eventually activating the ubiquitin proteasome system, and further
  triggering muscle proteolysis, with the skeletal muscle being the primary source.
  The reduced feed intake, which is mainly a result of upregulation of feed intake-lowering
  (anorexigenic) peptides and downregulation of orexigenic peptides, limits the exogenous
  nutrient supply and aggravates muscle proteolysis.
