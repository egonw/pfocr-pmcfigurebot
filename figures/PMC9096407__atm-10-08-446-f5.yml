caption: 'SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway activation promotes HUVECs migration, proliferation,
  and angiogenesis in vitro under high-fat conditions. (A) HUVECs proliferation was
  analyzed by using a CCK-8 assay; (B,C) the scratch assay of HUVECs. Cell migration
  was observed using a microscope (×4 magnification). HUVECs migration was impaired
  under high-fat conditions, and rescued by the SRT1720 treatment, and aggravated
  after treated with EX-527; (D-F) the growth of HUVECs was observed by tube forming
  experiment. All data were expressed as means ± SEM and were analyzed using one-way
  ANOVA. ***P<0.001, PA group comparison with CON group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001,
  PA + SRT1720 and PA + EX-527 compared with PA group. CON, control; HFD, high-fat
  diet; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; CCK-8, cell counting kit-8;
  SEM, standard error of the mean; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PA, palmitic acid.'
