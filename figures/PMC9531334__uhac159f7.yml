caption: Distinct spatial conformations of HC-ProO and HC-ProN proteins contributed
  to their different interaction strengths with StnCBP. Three-dimensional structural
  models of HC-ProO (a) and HC-ProN (b) were predicted using ROBETTA. The red area
  indicates the eIF4E-binding motif. N and C indicate the N- and C-terminal of HC-Pro
  protein, respectively. c Schematic illustrations of mutational and recombinant HC-Pro
  proteins. Black and gray bars represent the sequences derived from HC-ProN and HC-ProO,
  respectively. V346I denotes the substitution of 346th valine to isoleucine. Locations
  at the amino acid sequences indicate the mutational site and recombinant joints
  in HC-Pro. d Interactions between StnCBP and HC-Pro mutants/recombinations in Y2H
  assays. -W-L represents medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, while -W-L-H-A represents
  medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine. Paired combinations
  PGADT7-T/PGBKT7–53 and PGADT7-T/PGBKT7-lam represent positive and negative controls,
  respectively. e, f, and g Interactions between StnCBP and HC-Pro mutants/recombinations
  in the SLC assays. The luminescence images were captured using a CCD imaging system
  and the pseudocolor bar shows the range of luminescence intensity. The quantification
  of relative luciferase activity in leaves is equivalent to luminescence intensity/50 mm2
  leaf area, which was calculated using IndiGO imaging software. Each bar represents
  the mean ± SD of three replicates (n = 3). According to ordinary one-way ANOVA with
  multiple comparisons, different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05.
  Western blotting showed the protein abundance of NLuc and CLuc fusions.
