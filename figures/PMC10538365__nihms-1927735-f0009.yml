caption: Annona montana hexane subfraction potentiated the apoptotic effects of pharmacological
  PI3K/AKT blockers and Ras inhibitors on the blockage of the Ras/RAF/ERK signaling
  pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 0.01% DMSO (Control)
  and the indicated combination of hexane sub-fraction V (H, 20 μg/mL) or wortmannin
  (W, 0.233 μM) for 8 h. Then, equal amounts of lysates were analyzed by western blotting
  using antibodies against p-AKT (Ser473), t-AKT, p-mTOR (Ser2448), t-mTOR, p-S6K1
  (Thr421/Ser424), and t-S6K1. The western blots were performed three times, and a
  representative image of the three independent experiments is shown. (B–D) Relative
  levels of phosphorylated proteins (i.e., p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-S6K1) were determined
  by densitometry as described in the  section. They were expressed as a ratio of
  phosphorylated/total proteins. Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent
  experiments. *p < 0.05, and **p < 0.01 by student’s t-test compared to non-treated
  cells. (E) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (control),
  and the indicated combination of hexane subfraction V (H, 20 μg/mL), PF3758309 (PF,
  20 μM), or FR180204 (FR, 50 μM) for 8 h. Then equal amounts of lysates were analyzed
  by western blotting using antibodies against p-RAF (Ser259), t-RAF, p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204),
  and t-ERK. The western blots were performed three times, and a representative image
  of the three independent experiments is shown. (F, G) Relative levels of phosphorylated
  proteins (i.e., p-RAF, p-ERK) were determined by densitometry as described in the  section.
  They were expressed as a ratio of phosphorylated/total proteins. Data represent
  the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 by student’s t-test compared
  to non-treated cells. (H) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated combination
  of hexane subfraction V (H, 20 μg/mL) or Ras Inhibitor-ISIS 2503 (IS). Then, equal
  amounts of lysates were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies against Ras.
  Western blotting was performed three times, and a representative image of the three
  independent experiments is shown. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
  was used as a loading control. (I) Relative levels of Ras proteins were determined
  by densitometry as described in the  section, and they were expressed as a ratio
  of Ras/GAPDH proteins. Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05 by student’s t-test compared to non-treated cells.
