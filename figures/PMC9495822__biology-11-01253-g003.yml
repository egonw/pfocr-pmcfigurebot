caption: Differentially expressed genes between early and late BMR cells are compared.
  (a) A KEGG heatmap for the genes related to JAK–STAT signaling is shown. Upregulated
  and downregulated gene expressions in late BMR cells are compared to early BMR cells.
  The permutation of the gene set enrichment analysis is 10,000, and the cutoff p-value
  was selected as 0.05. The gene set enrichment scores were performed with a multiple
  test correction (Benjamini–Hochberg) (n = 3). Before creating the heatmap, raw gene
  expression abundances were scaled at the gene level, which is represented as the
  Z-score. (b) A schematic overview of the JAK–STAT pathway and SASP is represented
  with downregulated and upregulated genes.
