caption: Induction of anaerobic glycolysis promotes SCMV infection. (A) Simplified
  scheme of the glucose metabolic pathway. The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate,
  is further metabolized to lactate and alcohol in the anaerobic metabolic pathway
  or to acetyl-CoA in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway for the TCA cycle. UK5099
  and DCA were used to induce anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation,
  respectively. (B) Mosaic symptoms in UK5099-treated plants were more severe than
  that of water-treated plants, whereas those in DCA-treated plants were milder than
  in water-treated plants. Scale bars = 1 cm. (C) Relative accumulation levels of
  SCMV genomic RNA, determined by RT-qPCR, in 1 SLs of the water-, UK5099- or DCA-treated
  plants at 5 dpi. The results are represented as the means ± SE (n=3). Statistical
  differences between the treatments were determined using unpaired Student’s t-test
  (two-tailed), **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. (D) Accumulation levels of SCMV CP in 1
  SLs of the water-, UK5099- or DCA-treated plants at 5 dpi through western blotting
  analysis. The samples harvested from the water-treated plants were used as controls.
  The detected protein bands were visualized using the ImageJ software. The numbers
  between the two panels are the relative ratios of SCMV CP accumulated in UK5099-
  or DCA-treated plants verses the control plants. The amount of SCMV CP in the control
  plants is arbitrarily presented as 1.0. The actin bands in the lower panels are
  used to show sample loadings.
