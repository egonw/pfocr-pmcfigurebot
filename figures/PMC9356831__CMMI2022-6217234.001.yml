caption: 'Cur constrains the inflammatory response of sepsis mice and strengthens
  its immune function. (a) AST, ALT, BUN, and creatinine in the serum; (b) contents
  of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6); (c) flow cytometry detection of percentage
  of CD39+ Tregs; (d) HE staining test of glomerular injury, dilatation of renal tubules,
  inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular congestion in mice; (e) TUNEL staining
  detection of the apoptosis index of the liver and kidney tissue in mice; (f) RT-qPCR
  examination of miR-183-5p. The data in the figure are all measurement data, and
  each value represents the mean ± SD of 6 mice.  ∗vs. the Sham, (P) < 0.05; #vs.
  the LPS, (P) < 0.05.'
