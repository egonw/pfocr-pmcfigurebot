caption: Oleate prevents palmitate induced alteration in ER stress but not ERK phosphorylation
  in Huh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells were treated without (Ctr) or with 0.2 mM of oleate
  (OA), palmitate (PA) or a combination of both (OA+PA) for 16 h prior to a 15 min
  challenge with 250 nM of bovine insulin. Cells were used to measure the expression
  of different ER stress and downstream insulin signaling pathway proteins by Western
  blotting (Panel A). In a separate experiment, cells were used to determine the uptake
  of 2-NBD glucose for 1 h in triplicate after the insulin challenge (Panel B). Cells
  were also used for the extraction of total RNA to measure the expression of various
  ER stress genes by qRT-PCR (Panels C–G). Unspliced (u) and spliced (s) forms of
  XBP1 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR (Panel H). Values were plotted as mean ± SD. p
  values were calculated using Student’s t test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p
  < 0.001.
