caption: Blocking of estrogen and estrogen receptor pathway decreased ZEBRA expression
  under estrogen treatment. Effect of the selective estrogen receptor modulators,
  4‐hydroxytamoxifen (4‐OHT), raloxifene (Ral), and the selective estrogen receptor
  down regulator, ICI182780 (ICI), on the expression levels of ZEBRA in HK1‐EBV‐eGFP.
  HK1‐EBV‐eGFP cells treated with (A) 4‐OHT, (B) Ral, and (C) ICI, in the presence
  of estradiol (E2). All the selective estrogen receptor modulators and the down regulator
  impaired the effect of E2, which induced ZEBRA expression, compared with only E2
  treatment. HK1‐EBV‐eGFP (D) and NPC‐TW01‐EBV‐eGFP (E) cells were investigated to
  determine whether E2 could induce the expression of ZEBRA in NPC cells under the
  suppression of estrogen receptor α (ERα) via the ERα‐short interfering RNA (siESR1)
  assessed using western blotting. (F) A predictive model for the mechanism by which
  aromatase and estrogen induce the expression of ZEBRA and activate the lytic cycle
  showing the difference between men and women and between the state of premenopausal
  and postmenopausal
