caption: Key metabolic pathways of PDAC and molecular subtyping. (a) Univariate Cox
  regression indicated that glycolysis, bile acid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis
  and xenobiotic metabolism were prognostic indicators in PDAC (n = 288). (b) Two
  clusters were determined by consensus clustering in the E-MTAB-6134 cohort (n1 =
  123, n2 = 165). (c) Differences in the 4 metabolic pathways between the two clusters
  in the E-MTAB-6134 cohort. (d) GSEA of the glycolysis pathway between the two subtypes
  in the E-MTAB-6134 cohort. (e) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis between the two subtypes
  in the E-MTAB-6134 cohort. (f) Differences in the 4 metabolic pathways between Cluster
  1 (n = 17) and Cluster 3 (n = 13) in the ICGC cohort. (g) Kaplan–Meier survival
  analysis between Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 in the ICGC cohort.
