caption: Angiogenesis in aerobic exercise-induced transduction pathwayExercise can
  cause increases in AMP and H2O2, which subsequently activate AMPK. The activated
  AMPK followingly activates PGC1α, which is reinforced by the SIRT1 pathway. The
  activated PGC1α triggers the VEGF pathway and finally causes angiogenesis.
