caption: TBI SF-R enhances transcription associated with neuronal signaling and BBB
  disruption. Heatmaps showing standardized Z-score of DEGs (A) between sham SF-R
  and sham CON, (B) increased by SF-R compared to CON regardless of TBI, and (C) between
  TBI SF-R and TBI CON. (D) Injury-dependent SF-R effects on enriched themes, as defined
  by nanoString. TBI SF-R versus TBI CON has a larger percent of “Neurotransmission”
  and “Inflammation & Peripheral Immune Invasion” associated genes compared to Sham
  SF-R versus sham CON. Heatmaps showing standardized Z-score of DEGs (E) between
  TBI CON and sham CON, (F) increased by TBI regardless of SF-R, (G) between TBI SF-R
  versus sham CON. (H) IPA functional analysis of top activated pathways in TBI CON
  and TBI SF-R compared to sham CON. N = 23; n = 6 per group sham CON, TBI CON, and
  TBI SF-R; n = 5 per group sham SF-R. BBB, blood–brain barrier; CON, control; DEGs,
  differentially expressed genes; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; SF-R, sleep fragmentation
  with recovery; TBI, traumatic brain injury.
