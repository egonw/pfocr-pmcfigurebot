figure_title: β-catenin functionally regulates myocardial repair of PBMSCs in infarcted
  hearts through direct targeting of Oct4
caption: 'a Kaplan–Meier survival rates. b–e Echocardiography of LVFS (b), LVEDD (c),
  LVEDV (d), and LVAWd (e) before MI (pre-MI, baseline), 1 d after MI (1 d post-MI),
  30 d after MI (30 d post-MI) and 90 d after MI (90 d post-MI). Transplantation of
  the PBMSCs pretreated with β-catenin or Oct4 transfection had higher survival rates
  and resulted in significant improvement in cardiac function and structural remodeling.
  However, this effect was abolished in the shβ-catenin or shOct4 groups (oeβ-catenin+shOct4)
  and was rescued by combination with Oct4 transfection (shβ-catenin+oeOct4). For
  determination of the effects of the oeβ-catenin- or oeOct4-transfected MSCs on left
  ventricle structure at 90 days after MI, hearts were stained with TTC, Masson’s
  trichrome, or hematoxylin and eosin. f Quantitation of infarct size as determined
  by TTC staining at 90 d post-MI. g Morphometric measurements of the scar/LV area
  revealed a smaller scar in the oeβ-catenin- or oeOct4-transfected PBMSC-treated
  groups and a larger scar in the shβ-catenin- or shOct4-transfected PBMSC-treated
  groups than in the PBMSC- and PBS-treated groups. h Morphometric measurements of
  the viable cardiomyocytes in rat hearts from the different groups showed significantly
  larger areas of cardiomyocytes in the hearts treated with oeβ-catenin or oeOct4-transfected
  PBMSCs than with PBMSCs alone, shβ-catenin or shOct4-transfected PBMSCs and PBS.
  i Representative histological images of left ventricular basal, middle, and apex
  cross-sections after TTC staining in the PBS, PBMSC, and oeβ-catenin-, oeOct4- or
  shOct4-transfected PBMC groups. TTC-stained images were cut into transverse sections
  to assess the infarct size (percentage of the area of the entire LV, f). The surviving
  myocardium was stained brick red by TTC staining, and the infarcted myocardium was
  pale white (black arrows). In the oeβ-catenin- or oeOct4-transfected PBMC groups,
  the ischemic area was significantly smaller than that in the PBS and shOct4-transfected
  PBMC groups, suggesting a positive effect of β-catenin/Oct4-overexpressing PBMSCs
  on the infarcted hearts. j, k Collagen density measured by Masson’s trichrome staining
  was lower in the oeβ-catenin- or oeOct4-transfected PBMC-treated animals after 90
  days. The infarct zone of the oeβ-catenin- or oeOct4-transfected PBMC-treated groups
  contained islands of viable cardiomyocytes (red, k, red arrows, Label, 50 μm). l
