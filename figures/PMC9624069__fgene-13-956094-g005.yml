caption: Biological implications of the OIS-related risk score (A) GSEA results of
  the significantly enriched signaling pathways in the HCC patients with high-risk.
  GSEA was carried out using expression data of TCGA-LIHC tumors. The ESs, NESs and
  FDRs were determined by GSEA. (B) Network diagrams of the enriched signaling pathways
  with p < 0.05. Enrichplot analysis was used to create the network diagrams. The
  number of genes included in the pathway is represented by the size of the circle,
  and the number of genes shared by the connected pathways is shown by the thickness
  of the line. (C) A heatmap of the expression levels of SASP-related genes in HCC
  tumors from TCGA. (D) GSVA scores of SASP in the high- and low-risk groups. The
  p value was assessed by Wilcox test. GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; TCGA, the cancer genome atlas; ES, enrichment score; NES, normalized
  enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate; SASP, senescence-associated secretory
  phenotype; GSVA, gene set variation analysis.
