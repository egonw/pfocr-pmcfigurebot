caption: Wig-1 interacts with deadenylase subunit CNOT6. Knockdown of the key components
  of the ARE-mediated mRNA decay pathway CNOT6, DCP1a, PM/Scl-75 and XRN1 was performed
  in HCT116 p53−/− cells, and the levels of FAS mRNA were assessed through qRT–PCR
  and compared with levels upon Wig-1 depletion. The figure shows that FAS mRNA levels
  are increased in a comparable manner following knockdown of CNOT6 or Wig-1 (no significant
  difference), suggesting that the Wig-1 effect on FAS mRNA is exerted at the level
  of poly(A) tail deadenylation (a). Protein lysates from HCT116 p53+/+ or HCT116
  p53−/− cells transfected with pCMVtag2b or pCMVtag2bhWig-1 were immunoprecipitated
  with a Flag antibody or CNOT6 antibody cross-linked to Dynabeads Protein G, followed
  by western blotting with indicated antibodies (b). Coimmunostaining of endogenous
  Wig-1 (green) and CNOT6 (red) (c) and Wig-1 (green) and SGs marker TIAR (red) (d)
  in HCT116 p53+/+ cells after 30 min of treatment with 0.5 mM arsenite shows colocalization
  in cytoplasmic SGs. Arrows indicate the positions of overlapping Wig-1 and CNOT6
  foci or Wig-1 and TIAR. Scale bars, 20 μm. DAPI shows DNA staining.
