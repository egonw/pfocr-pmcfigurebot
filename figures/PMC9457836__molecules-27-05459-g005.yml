caption: (A) Schematic diagram of IL-33 mRNA expression. Pollen/PMA stimulation of
  epithelial cells causes activation of PKCδ/HSP90/ERK signaling, which causes the
  expression of the IL-33 gene (B) schematic diagram of IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway.
  IL-33 is the ligand for ST2. It activates the ST2L/IL-1RAcP dimers or is neutralized
  by binding to sST2. The interaction of IL-33 with ST2 leads to the recruitment of
  MyD88, which results in the activation of MAPK-ERK and NF-κB, ultimately inducing
  related gene expression. Inhibition of ERK by betuletol may block the PKCδ/HSP90/ERK-mediated
  IL-33 mRNA expression and/or, IL-33/ST2-mediated inflammatory reactions. MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; NF-κB, the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Illustration created
  with BioRender.com.
