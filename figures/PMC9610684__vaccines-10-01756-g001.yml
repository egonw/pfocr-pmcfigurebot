caption: 'Overactivation of NETosis-related proteins in A. phagocytophilum-infected
  human cells. (A) Protein interactions network between proteins that are significantly
  different in human cell proteomics analysis. The color of each nod is based on Log2
  fold change, and edge mapping width is based on protein interaction score: min =
  0.2, max = 1.00. (B1) Eleven different ontology terms have been used for the go
  study. (B2) GO data shows that proteins are involved in the ‘innate immune system’,
  ‘response to stress’, and ‘lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway’ are significant
  triggers in the network. (B3) Reactome data shows the association of the ‘innate
  immune system’ and ‘neutrophil degranulation’ pathways in our data. (C) String network
  shows a protein-protein interaction implied in NETosis.'
