caption: KEGG enrichment analysis result. (A) Statistical charts of Grade B categories
  of each pathway. (B) Top 25 of KEGG enrichment pathways. (A,B) shown that NTDs-related
  genes were mainly enriched in pathways in cancer and signal transduction. (C) KEGG
  pathways network. The signals at the center of the top 25 signaling pathway interaction
  network include wnt, MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.
