caption: The JA biosynthesis at different developmental stages. (A) The pathway of
  α-linolenic acid metabolism and JA biosynthesis according to the KEGG database.
  (B) The heat map of genes associated with α-linolenic acid metabolism and JA biosynthesis
  based on their expression level. (C).The concentration of JA during root development.
  (D) The expression of genes DaPLA2A, DaAOS1, DaAOS2, DaOPR3, DaAOC1, DaTIFY11B,
  DaTIFY11A, and DaMYC2 during root development. AOS, allene oxide synthase. The values
  of (C, D) are the means ± SD; n = 3. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s
  t test compared with L1. **, P < 0.01, *, P < 0.05. OPR3, 12-oxophytodienoic acid
  reductase; PLA2A, Phospholipase A2A.
