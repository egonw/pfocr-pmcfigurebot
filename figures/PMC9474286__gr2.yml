caption: Separation of monolignol and lignan metabolites from phenylalanine/tyrosine
  to pluviatolide. DAD measurement at 280 nm during RP18 HPLC separation of an artificial
  metabolite standard mix containing metabolites 1–4, 6–8, 10–12,14–20, ∼18 mg L−1
  each () is displayed. A gradient of MeOH and 0.1% formic acid was used at a flow
  rate of 0.3 ml min−1. Peaks are numbered according to . Phenylalanine (1) is only
  represented by a number in this chromatogram, as it does not exhibit sufficient
  absorption at 280 nm.
article_title: A targeted metabolomics method for extra- and intracellular metabolite
  quantification covering the complete monolignol and lignan synthesis pathway.
