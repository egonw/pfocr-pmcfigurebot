caption: 'Single‐cell RNA sequencing reveals macrophage heterogeneity in anti‐GBM
  cGN in Tlr4flox/flox and Tlr4fl/fl/LysM‐cre mice. A) UMAP visualization of seven
  distinct kidney macrophage/monocyte clusters (Cluster 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9),
  in Tlr4flox/flox and Tlr4fl/fl/LysM‐cre integrated transcriptome profile at day
  7 post anti‐GBM cGN induction, colored according to cluster designation. B) Bar
  plot showing the proportions of cells among macrophage/monocyte cell populations,
  colored according to cluster designation. C) Heatmap showing the top 10 most differentially
  upregulated genes in each monocyte/macrophage subcluster identified through unsupervised
  clustering. Expression scale is shown on the bottom. D) Heatmap for renal resident
  and recruited macrophage markers expression among macrophage/monocyte subpopulations.
  Expression scale is shown on the bottom. Colored UMAP plots highlighted cells with
  activated gene sets expression in E) antigen processing and presentation, wound
  healing, phagocytosis and cytokine signaling in immune response, and F) TLR4, NF‐κB,
  IL‐17, TNF, TGF‐β and detoxification of reactive oxygen species signaling among
  macrophages/monocytes based on AUC scores. Each point is depicted a single cell.
  Cells with indicated signaling activation were colored in shades of pink‐red, and
  those without signaling activation were colored in black‐blue. Boxplots on the right
  statistically compare AUC enrichment scores of genes annotated for relative pathways
  between the seven macrophages/monocytes clusters, and between Tlr4flox/flox and
  Tlr4fl/fl/LysM‐cre group. The complete lists of genes used to compute enrichment
  are according to KEGG: mmu04612 [antigen processing and presentation], GO:0042060
  [wound healing], GO:0006909 [phagocytosis], Reactome: R‐MMU‐1280215 [Cytokine signaling
  in immune response], GO:0050729 [TLR4 signaling pathway], KEGG: mmu04064 [NF‐κB
  signaling pathway], KEGG: mmu04657 [IL‐17 signaling pathway], KEGG:mmu04668 [TNF
  signalling pathway], KEGG: mmu04350 [TGF‐β signaling pathway] and Reactome: R‐MMU‐3299685
