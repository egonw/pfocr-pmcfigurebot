caption: 'Participation of cIAPs in NF-κB classical and alternative pathways. E3 ligase
  activity from IAPs’ RING domain allow the addition of Ub residues onto proteins
  involved in these signaling cascades. In the classical pathway, cIAPs have a positive
  regulatory function while they exhibit negative regulation in the alternative pathway.
  Abbreviations: NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells),
  TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), RIPK (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase), TRADD (TNF Receptor Associated Death Domain), TRAF (TNF Receptor Associated
  Factor), cIAP (cellular-Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein), LUBAC (Linear Ubiquitination
  Assembly Complex), IKK (IκB Kinase), NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), Ub (ubiquitin).'
