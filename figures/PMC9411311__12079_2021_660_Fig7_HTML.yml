caption: GVITAA human peptide inhibits TCR signaling in peripheral human T cells.
  Western blot analysis of phosphorylation status of signaling proteins involved in
  proximal T cell receptor signal transduction pathway in human T cells incubated
  with GH peptide. When stimulated with CD3/CD28 antibody, there was an increase in
  phosphorylation of signaling molecules ( +) compared to unstimulated cells (-).
  Pre-incubation of cells with TAT peptide alone did not affect the increase in phosphorylation
  (T), whereas pre-incubation of cells with GH peptide (500 µM) completely inhibited
  CD3/CD28-mediated phosphorylation of the signaling molecules (GH). Pre-incubation
  of human T cells with the mutant peptide (MGH) did not have any effect on the phosphorylation
  of signaling molecules
