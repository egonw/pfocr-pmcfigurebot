caption: 'Hypothesis for dentigerous cyst (DC) formation: (A) Developed permanent
  retained tooth (the third molar) in the mandible. (B) Due to a specific mutation,
  such as the loss of heterozygosity caused by a second hit in the encoding gene for
  Patched receptor homolog 1 (PTCH1), the Sonic Hedgehog pathway in the primary cilia
  is over-activated, causing a monoclonal proliferation of the mutated cell (red color)
  in the stellate reticular layer of enamel organ [,,]. (C) In the specific microenvironment,
  local hypoxia develops in the center of the monoclonal cell cluster (purple color).
  Hypoxia activates the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α),
  which leads at the same time to apoptosis and proliferation []. (D) The proliferation
  is dominant on the margins, while the cells of the reduced enamel epithelium in
  the center cease to proliferate; in this way, a cavity is formed. The caspase-3,
  as a promotor of apoptosis, is overexpressed [,]. The hyperosmolar environment created
  by the accumulation of cell breakdown products absorbs fluids from the vicinity
  (green-brown color) and exerts pressure on the epithelial lining []. The epithelial
  cells produce cytoplasmic polycystin (PC1), which upregulates the expression of
  α2β1 integrins, thus increasing the cell adhesive rate [,]. The cyst is lateral
  to the crown of the tooth (the crown may be entirely included in the cyst sac),
  while the root is outside the cystic sac. (E) The cyst is attached to the tooth
  neck at the cement-enamel border, which limits its further growth in this direction
  but it can continue to grow into the bone. In this phase, enamel epithelial cells,
  which are in contact with the crown of the tooth, die because they are under pressure
  and have no nutrition (hypoxia). (For interpretation of the references to color
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
