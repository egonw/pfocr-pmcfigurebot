caption: Sodium cantharidate (SCA) induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. (A) The
  apoptosis rates of breast cancer cells treated with SCA for 24 h determined using
  flow cytometry. (B) Western blot analysis of apoptotic protein levels in SCA-treated
  breast cancer cells for 24 h. (C) Caspase3 activity in SCA-treated breast cancer
  cells after 24 h. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared
  with the control group).
