caption: Microbiota, gut, and microglia connections. The communication routes between
  microbiota and microglia are depended on the location. In colon, MAMPs derived from
  gut bacteria approach to macrophages through disrupted tight junctions of intestinal
  tract barrier to stimulate IL‐6 and TNF‐α secretion, and SCFAs enter into capillaries
  by positive or passive transportation with the help of SMCT or MCT. In small intestine,
  metabolites from microbiota, such as gut peptides, chemicals, and SCFAs, could be
  absorbed by vagal villi afferents or leak into lamina propria through increased
  paracellular permeability to interact with immune cells (T cells, B cells, and macrophages),
  which might lead to the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including TGF‐β, IL‐6,
  and TNF‐α. Signals produced in the GI tract could enter into the bloodstream and
  activate vagus nerve or immune cells to communicate with microglia in the brain.
  Infiltrated CD4 T cells in the brain interact with microglia and induce upregulated
  expression of MHC‐II, IL‐10, IL‐1β, and TLR‐2 on the surface of microglia. TGF‐β
  binds to receptors on microglia and downregulates Smad3 signaling pathway. Interactions
  between microglia and T cells could also inhibit the proliferation of neural stem
  cells by IFN‐γ secretion. Pro‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐6 or TNF‐α) from circulation
  mediate the state of the microglia and induce neuroinflammation in the aged brain
