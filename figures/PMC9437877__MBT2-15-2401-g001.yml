caption: '7‐SGL regulates the NRF2/HO‐1 pathway in H22 cells.A. 7‐SGL protect HT22
  cells from ODG/R injury.B. Increased level HO‐1 induced by 7‐SGL. NRF2 in nucleus
  (n‐NRF2) revealed no significant difference among groups. (C) Treated groups showed
  obvious translocation of NRF2 (green) from cytoplasm to the nucleus (blue), while
  Keap1 (red) remained in cytoplasm, as revealed by immunofluorescence (scale bar = 20 μm).
  ctl, normal group; veh, OGD/R group; 1 (or 1 μM), 5 and 10 (or 10 μM), drug groups
  with 1 μM, 5 μM and 10 μM of 7‐SGL dosing, respectively. H3 and TUBULIN, loading
  control. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared with ctl. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01,
