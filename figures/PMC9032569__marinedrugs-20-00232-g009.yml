caption: 'Inhibitory effects of FCP on cisplatin-induced ROS generation in TECs via
  activation of p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK signaling pathway. Intracellular ROS levels
  were determined via fluorescence microscopy (a) and spectroscopy (b). The increased
  ROS production induced by cisplatin returned to the control level by treatment with
  FCP, SB203580 (A), SP600125 (B) and U0126 (C) in TECs. Results are presented as
  the means ± SD of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs.
  the control. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs. the cisplatin alone-treated
  group. Scale bar = 50 µm.'
