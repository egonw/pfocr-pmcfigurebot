caption: (a) Heat map of the specific amino acid, glucose, lactate, and ammonia uptake
  and release rates for the metabolic phases of the STD (n = 2) and HSD (n = 2) processes.
  (b) Heat map of intracellular fluxes of glycolysis (GLYC), TCA cycle (TCA1‐4), pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP1–3), and the ratio of TCA to glycolytic activity (TCA/GLYC)
  for the metabolic phases of the STD (n = 2) and HSD (n = 2) processes. GLYC, F1,6BP
  to GAP; TCA1, Pyr to AcCoA; TCA2, Cit to AKG; TCA3, AKG to Suc; TCA4, Mal to OAA;
  PPP1, G6P to 6P‐gluconate; PPP2, R5P to nucleotide synthesis; PPP3, sum of fluxes
  from ribulose‐5P and xylulose‐5P to F6P and GAP. The values of all calculated fluxes
  and rates are reported in Table . GLYC, glycolysis; HSD, high seeding densities;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; STD, standard; TCA, tricarboxylic acid [Color figure
