figure_title: GLAST+, SOX2+supporting cells are induced adjacent to reprogrammed hair
  cells in the GER
caption: '(A) Control and reprogrammed cochleae immunostained for markers specific
  to inner phalangeal and border cells (GLAST), a general supporting cell marker (SOX2),
  pillar and Deiters’ cells (PROX1), and the hair cell marker, Myosin VIIA. The reprogrammed
  hair cell region is indicated (line; eHC – ectopic hair cells). Images show 16 µm
  sections of the organ of Corti (control and reprogrammed). Scale bar: 50 µm. (B)
  Differentially expressed genes from our P1-P8 scRNA-seq experiments in reprogrammed
  GLAST + supporting cells are compared to control inner phalangeal/border cells.
  Volcano plots show common upregulated genes Cryab, Ccnd1, Rcn1, Hes5, and downregulated
  genes Lum, Ecrg4, Gsn, Clu (GER specific genes). (C) Notch pathway genes are upregulated
  in the reprogrammed GLAST + cells and hair cells in response to transcription factor
  induction at P8. UMAP plot of cells integrated from all genotypes is shown with
  the reprogrammed hair cells (red) and GLAST positive supporting cells (green). Average
  log10 fold change in the expression of supporting cell-specific Notch genes – Ccnd1,
  Hes5, Lfng, Jag1, Hes1, Notch1, Cdkn1a, Nrarp, Hey1, Gata3, Hes6, Heyl and hair-cell-specific
  Notch genes – Dll3, Jag2, Dlk2 is represented.'
