figure_title: Anti-HSV-1 immunity in the CNS is due to a cell-intrinsic, cell-type-dependent
  TLR3-IFN response
caption: Studies using hPSCs have dissected the differences in anti-HSV-1 cell-intrinsic
  immunity between various CNS cell-types. In healthy controls, hPSC-derived cortical
  neurons and oligodendrocytes show a cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity to HSV-1,
  which is dependent on intact TLR3-IFN signalling. This cell-intrinsic immunity is
  lost in patients who have deficiencies in the TLR3-IFN signalling pathway (due to
  genetic variants in TLR3, UNC93B, or STAT1 for example) or in TLR3−/− isogenic control
  cells. Interestingly, hPSC-derived trigeminal neurons lack TLR3-IFN-dependent anti-HSV-1
  immunity and show productive viral infection also in WT cells, closely mimicking
  the in vivo situation where trigeminal neurons are the reservoir for latent HSV-1
  infection even in healthy individuals.
