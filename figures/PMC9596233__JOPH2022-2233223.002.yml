caption: 'The cytoplasmic Ca2+ level. To determine the Ca2+ level in the cytoplasm,
  the fluorescence intensity of Ca2+ in RPE cells was assessed by confocal microscopy
  using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-3/AM. Scale bar = 20 µm. The graph shows the quantified
  data. The data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). An LSD test was conducted
  following one-way ANOVA. ∗P < 0.05 vs. control cells; #P < 0.05 vs. blue light-treated
  cells; and &P < 0.05 vs. blue light + chloroquine-treated cells; ▲P < 0.05 vs. blue
  light + A2E-treated cells.'
