caption: GABAARα1 binds TLR4 in the medullary dorsal horn of the epilepsy–migraine
  comorbidity. Protein extracts from the medullary dorsal horn tissue of the epilepsy–migraine
  comorbid rats were studied for TLR4/GABAARα1 co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) with
  the GABAARα1 antibody or normal IgG (control), and the precipitates were immunoblotted
  with GABAARα1, TLR4, and GAPDH antibodies. TLR4 was seen in the anti-GABAARα1 (but
  not normal IgG) precipitates from the protein extracts, indicative of protein–protein
  interaction.
