caption: ASPM depletion inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of ATC cells.
  ((a), (b)) Validation of ASPM knockdown in 8505C and TTA1 cells by qRT-PCR and western
  blotting. ((c), (d)) ATC cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 assay and colony
  formation assay. ((e), (f)) Migration and invasion abilities of ATC cells were assessed
  by Transwell assay. (g) The protein levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin
  in ATC cells after transfection of sh-ASPM. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
