caption: SC protects against the damage caused by glutamate in HT22 cells. The cells
  were incubated with or without indicated concentration of SC for 1 h, and then further
  incubated with 5 mM glutamate for 12 h. (A) Effect of SC on sub-G1 DNA content in
  glutamate-treated HT22 cells. The sub-G1 DNA content was observed by PI staining.
  (B) Effects of SC on glutamate-induced apoptotic bodies were determined by Hoechst
  33342 staining. Scale bar 100 μm (C–J) Effects of SC on protein expression related
  to apoptosis were observed by Western blot assay. The statistical symbols (** p
  < 0.01; *** p < 0.001) indicate significant differences from the glutamate-treated
  group.
