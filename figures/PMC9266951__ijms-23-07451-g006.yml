caption: Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. (A) Significantly
  downregulated enriched gene ontology for AZD treatment in the RNA-seq database.
  (B) Significantly upregulated enriched gene ontology for AZD treatment in the RNA-seq
  database. Gene ontology was ranked by their significance. The value represents the
  number of differentially expressed genes. MF, molecular function; CC, cellular component;
  BP, biological process. (C) The top 20 functionally enriched KEGG pathways in downregulated
  DEGs. (D) The top 20 functionally enriched KEGG pathways in upregulated DEGs.
