caption: Statistics of the directed analysis of ¹H_T₂ spectra of plasma samples from
  the NCP 3 months (in green) vs. NCP 1-year (in red) groups. (a) PCA score chart.
  (b) OPLS-DA score graph (n = 13, R2 = 0.999, and Q2 = 0.448, p = 0.054). (c) Bar
  graphs of normalized peak intensities of identified metabolites with differences
  between the two groups. Its bucket integrals in the spectra were considered relevant
  for the OPLS-DA classification obtained in (b). From left to right, the respective
  t-test value of p is 0.018 and 0.018. (d) Metabolic topology pathway results based
  on potential metabolites in OPLS-DA models.
