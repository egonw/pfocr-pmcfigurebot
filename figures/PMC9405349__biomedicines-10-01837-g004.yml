caption: 'TGF-β signaling pathway regulates GLUT3-induced EMT in CRC cells. (A) Lysates
  of the HCT116 cells treated or not with 10 μM SB431542 for 48 h. Western blot analysis
  was conducted for measuring the protein levels of TGF-β RI, GLUT3, α-SMA, ZEB1 and
  PAI-1. (B) Cell invasion was analyzed after 24 h post transfection with GLUT3/pEJ-3HA
  (1.5 µg) and treated or not with 10 μM SB431542 for 24 h to allow for the permeabilization
  of the transwell membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.2% crystal violet. Scale
  bar, 100 µm. TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; GLUT3, glucose transporter 3;
  EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition; TGF-β RI, transforming growth factor-β receptor
  I; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; ZEB1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1, PAI-1,
  plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Data are the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
  significance was analyzed by analysis of variance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and
  *** p < 0.001, significantly different compared with control; ## p < 0.01 compared
  to the GLUT3 group.'
