figure_title: Prior studies implicate the serotonin and dopamine system in NGLY1 deficiency
caption: A) Diagram showing the differentially expressed genes in the Drosophila dopamine
  biosynthesis and transport pathways. Gene expression data was from Tubulin>dNGLY1-RNAi
  whole flies reported in a previous study []. B) Spearman correlation analysis between
  survival upon knockdown of dNGLY1 [] and gene expression of serotonin and dopamine
  receptors at baseline in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel [].
article_title: An in vivo drug repurposing screen and transcriptional analyses reveals
  the serotonin pathway and GSK3 as major therapeutic targets for NGLY1 deficiency.
