caption: PF543 improved cardiac function and inhibited inflammation in rats after
  MI. (a) ELISA results of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in rat serum. (b) mRNA expression
  of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in rat myocardium. (c) Myocardial ischemic area of rats.
  (d–f) LVEF, LVFS, and E/A of rats. (“∗” means p < 0.05 vs. the sham group; “#” means
  p < 0.05 vs. the MI group), based on Student's t-test.
