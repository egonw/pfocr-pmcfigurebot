caption: 'Dissecting the malignant cells with high 3 S-MMR score. (A) The development
  trajectory of malignant cells inferred by Monocle2. Malignant cells with high 3 S-MMR
  scores most located in the roots of differentiation, and the malignant cells with
  low 3 S-MMR scores mainly located in the middle and end-point state. (B) Heatmap
  of the 3 S-MMR score-related genes in malignant cells along the pseudo-time. (C)
  Heatmap showing the different TFs activation between high and low 3 S-MMR score
  malignant cells. (D, E) Top activities of TFs between high (D) and low 3 S-MMR (E)
  score of malignant cells. RSS indicates Regulon Specificity Score. (F, G) Cellchat
  analysis of all cell types. Both interaction numbers and interaction strengths were
  showed. (H, I) Hierarchical plot showing the inferred intercellular communication
  network for SPP1 signaling pathway. (J) HE staining showing histologically distinct
  regions of stRNA samples. yellow: cancer region. (K) The spatial plot of 3 S-MMR
  score intensity. (L) The distribution of different cell types in the spatial map
  was identified by the algorithm of RCTD.'
