caption: 'Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins in the dorsal raphe.
  (A) The 89 significant proteins in the DR of the PWE versus control comparison were
  significantly enriched for an inhibition of the EIF2 signalling pathway (P-value
  of overlap = 1.29 × 10−8, z = −2.00). (B) The 219 significant proteins in the DR
  of the SUDEP versus control comparison were significantly associated with ten activated
  pathways and one inhibited pathway, P-value of overlap and z scores detailed in
  . (C) Of the 219 significant proteins in the DR of the SUDEP versus control comparison,
  proteins were trending in the same direction (up/down) in the PWE versus control
  comparison with a positive correlation (P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.87). Significance after
  ANOVA with q value correction followed by Tukey’s post hoc test is indicated by
  colour: yellow = PWE versus control and SUDEP versus control; white = SUDEP versus
  control; purple = SUDEP versus control and SUDEP versus PWE.'
