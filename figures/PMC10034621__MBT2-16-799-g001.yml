caption: CB‐GLP‐1 exerts antihypertensive effects via activating the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1
  signalling pathway in rats. Values are presented as means ± SD (n = 3). (A) Western
  blotting of GLP‐1R, AMPK, p‐AMPK, mTOR, p‐mTOR, 70S6K, p‐70S6K, 4EBP1 and p‐4EBP1
  expression in heart tissues. The relative expressions of (B) GLP‐1R, (C) p‐AMPK/AMPK,
  (D) p‐mTOR/mTOR, (E) p‐70S6K/70S6K and (F) p‐4EBP1/4EBP1 were quantified by ImageJ,
  β‐actin was used as an internal control, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and
  ****p < 0.0001.
