caption: The relationship of the expression of ILF3 and ox-LDL. (A, B) ox-LDL promoted
  the expression of ILF3 in a time-concentration-dependent manner, the optimal concentration
  and intervention time was 40 μg/ml and 48h. (C) ILF3 was knocked down by ILF3-specific
  small interference RNA (siRNA) in HGC-27 and Ncl-N87 cells. The mRNA and protein
  expression level of ILF3 was verified by RT-qPCR and western blot. The ILF3 expression
  at the mRNA and protein levels was significantly lower in the ILF3-siRNA group compared
  with the negative control group in HGC-27 and Ncl-N87 cells. (D) ILF3 was overexpressed
  by ILF3-overexpressed plasmids (flag-ILF3) in HGC-27 and Ncl-N87 cells. The mRNA
  and protein expression level of ILF3 was verified by RT-qPCR and western blot. The
  ILF3 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was significantly higher in the flag-ILF3
  group compared with the negative control group in HGC-27 and Ncl-N87 cells. **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 vs. 0 μg/L or 48 h groups.
