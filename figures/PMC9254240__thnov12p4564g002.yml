caption: Blocking FGFR signaling pathway promoted T cell infiltration into TNBC. A
  and B) EMT6 (A) and 4T1 (B) tumor growth in vehicle-treated versus FGFR inhibitor
  (FGFRi) Erdafitinib-treated immunocompetent BALB/c mice (n=7 mice/group, two-way
  ANOVA). C and D) Percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in primary EMT6 (C) and 4T1
  (D) tumors from vehicle-treated versus FGFRi-treated mice (n=6, t test). E) Representative
  IHC staining of CD3 in tumor tissues from vehicle-treated versus FGFRi-treated mice.
  F) 4T1 tumor growth in vehicle-treated versus FGFRi-treated immunodeficient nude
  mice (n=7 mice/group, two-way ANOVA). G) 4T1 tumor growth in vehicle-treated versus
  FGFRi-treated BALB/c mice where CD8+ T-cells were depleted by anti-CD8 antibodies
  (n=6 mice/group, two-way ANOVA). H) t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
  (tSNE) plot of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes overlaid with color-coded clusters
  in 4T1 tumors from vehicle-treated versus FGFRi-treated BALB/c mice. Dotted ellipses
  highlight clusters with significant differences between two groups. I) Heat map
  displaying normalized marker expression of each immune cluster. J) Frequency of
  clusters of indicated immune cell subsets. Data are mean Â± s.e.m. (n=5 mice/group,
  t test).
