caption: 'Piezo1 activation changes vascular tone response in IPA. Piezo1 contracted
  Nx IPA, but relaxed 1W-CH IPA. (A) A typical trace of IPA tension was recorded in
  the presence of Yoda1 in Nx (A1), 1W-CH (A2,A3), and 3W-CH (A4) conditions. For
  1W-CH, two types of responses could be observed: a relaxation (A2) or a contraction
  (A3). In (A3), the application of carbachol (endothelial M3 agonist) induces a relaxation
  showing a functional endothelium. (B) Statistical analysis of the contraction induced
  by Yoda1 (2–20 μM) in Nx IPA. The Yoda1 (20 µM)-induced contraction was inhibited,
  in absence of extracellular calcium (0 Ca2+), by GdCl3 (Gd3+, 100 µM) and amplified
  in the presence of L-NAME (100 µM). (C) Amplitude of the Yoda1-mediated relaxation
  in 1W-CH. In the presence of L-NAME (100 µM) or mechanical abrasion of the endothelium,
  the relaxation induced by 20 µM Yoda1 was reversed to a contraction. (D) Comparison
  of the effect of 20 µM Yoda1 in Nx, 1W-CH, or 3W-CH IPA. * p  <  0.05. The number
  inserted in the bar graph represented the number of arterial rings analyzed. The
  vertical arrow represents the beginning of the drug’s application. ns = not significant.
  A minimum of four different rats, at least four rings per rat were used.'
