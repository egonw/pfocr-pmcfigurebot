caption: 'Serum metabolomics of mice with JP backregulated metabolites and metabolic
  pathway enrichment analysis. The differential metabolites of mouse serum were analyzed
  by chromatography–mass spectrometry, and the differential metabolites were screened
  in positive-ion (a) and negative-ion (b) modes and enriched for metabolic pathways
  (c). Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (n = 6). #P < 0.05 and
  ##P < 0.01 versus the MPJ group; ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the lpr group.'
