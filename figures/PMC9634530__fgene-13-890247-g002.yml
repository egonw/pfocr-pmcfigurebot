caption: 'Main signaling pathway of KRAS mutations: ① MAPK signaling pathway: continuous
  activation of KRAS leads to the activation of RAF, the first kinase in the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which phosphorylates MEK and then activates extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK both activates the cytoplasmic matrix and is
  transported to the nucleus to stimulate the expression of multiple genes involved
  in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and cell cycle regulation. Extensive
  studies have shown that MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role in RAS-mediated
  tumorigenesis. ② PI3K signaling pathway: phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-diphosphate trikinase
  (PI3K) also plays a key role in RAS-mediated tumorigenesis. When KRAS is activated,
  PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-phosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol
  3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3) through phosphorylation, which activates phosphoinositol-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1) and phosphorylates AKT, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase.
  AKT activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). ③ NF-κB signaling pathway: At
  rest, NF-κB forms a complex with its inhibitory factors, which anchors NF-κB to
  the cytosol. When KRAS is activated, the RAL-NF-κB pathway is activated.'
