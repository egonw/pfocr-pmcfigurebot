caption: Increasing 3βHSD1 activity impairs enzalutamide efficacy(A) Cell growth of
  VCaP-Enz and VCaP-Ctr cells when treated with different concentrations of enzalutamide.
  VCaP cells were treated with 1 μM Enz (VCaP-Enz) or ethanol (VCaP-Ctr) for more
  than 3 months.(B) Pathway enrichment in VCaP-Enz cells.(C) Higher basal AR signaling
  activity in VCaP-Enz cells. DHT-upregulated genes in VCaP cells were used as AR-signaling
  signature genes.(D) Increased DHEA metabolism in VCaP-Enz cells. Cells were treated
  with [3H]-DHEA.(E and F) Increased expression of HSD3B1 mRNA (E) and 3βHSD1 protein
  (F) in VCaP-Enz cells.(G) Abundance of 3βHSD1 in enzalutamide-treated LNCaP cells.
  LNCaP cells were treated with enzalutamide (1 or 10 μM) for more than 4 weeks.(H)
  Increased 3βHSD1 activity in biopsy samples (n = 9 patients) treated with 10 μM
  enzalutamide for 1 week.(I) DHT had significantly higher affinity for wild-type
  AR compared with enzalutamide. VCaP cells were treated with [3H]-R1881 and the indicated
  drugs. Intracellular radioactivity was measured and normalized to protein abundance.(J)
  DHEA activated AR signaling more effectively in VCaP-Enz cells. DHEA, 100 nM; DHT,
  1 nM; cortisol, 100 nM.(K) Cell growth of VCaP-Enz and VCaP-Ctr cells when treated
  with enzalutamide together with DHEA (200 nM) or DHT (1 nM).(L) Expression of HSD3B1
  induced by doxycycline (Dox; 1 μg/μL) diminished enzalutamide inhibition of AR signaling
  in VCaP-pLVX-HSD3B1 stable cells. DHEA, 200 nM; DHT, 1 nM; Enz, 1 μM.(M) Expression
  of 3βHSD1 impaired enzalutamide function in suppressing DHEA-induced cell growth.
  DHEA, 200 nM; DHT, 1 nM.(N) Overexpression of 3βHSD1 impaired the inhibition of
  enzalutamide on DHEA-induced xenograft growth. VCaP-pLVX-HSD3B1 cells were injected
  in castrated mice with DHEA pellets for xenograft assay. Ctr group, n = 12; Enz
  group, n = 14; Dox group, n = 13; Dox + Enz group, n = 13. Dox, 2 mg/mL in water;
  Enz, 10 mg/kg.∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01. Results are presented as mean ± SD. Experiments
  were performed at least three times independently.See also .
