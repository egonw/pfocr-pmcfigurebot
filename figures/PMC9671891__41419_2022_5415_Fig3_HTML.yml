figure_title: LH-EGFR signaling and S1P increase the protein levels of PLN
caption: a Representative images of PLN and SERCA2 (green) staining in the ovaries
  isolated from eCG-primed mice. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).
  Scale bars, 100 μm. b Fluorescence intensity analysis of PLN and SERCA2 in oocytes
  (OO), cumulus cells (CC), and MGCs. A total of 12 large antral follicles were scored.
  c, d The mRNA (b) and protein (c) levels of PLN in oocytes, cumulus cells, and MGCs
  isolated from eCG-primed mice. e Western blotting analysis of PLN levels in MGCs
  and/or cumulus cells isolated from the mice before and after hCG treatment (2 h),
  the follicles at 2 h of culture, and the COCs at 2 h of culture. f Western blotting
  analysis of PLN levels in cumulus cells of COCs at 2 h (right panel) or 0.5 h (left
  panel) of culture. GAPDH was used as an internal control (d–f). g Model of the signaling
  pathway for S1P elevating intracellular calcium levels. The endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) is represented as an orange square. S1P increases PLN levels to inhibit SERCA2
  activity, thereby increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. For a–f, n = 3
  independent experiments. The data represent the mean ± s.d. P values were determined
  by two-sided Student’s t-test (left two panels of e, right panel of f) and one-way
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test (b–d, right two panels of e, left panel of f). ns
  not significant.
