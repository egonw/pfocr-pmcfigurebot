caption: 'Metabolomic profile of DDT exposure. In (A), a heatmap of the top 25 metabolites
  with the smallest P-value hierarchically clustered shows that in all strains, DDT
  decreases metabolite intensity. In (B), a PCA biplot of PC1 plotted against PC2
  shows that strains exposed to DDT cluster differently from the wildtype and nonaggregating
  control strains. The aggregating strain does not cluster with the wildtype and nonaggregating
  control groups, suggesting variation as a result of aggregating tau protein expression.
  In (C), the different metabolic pathways enriched by features associated with DDT
  exposure in the worms. Enrichment is calculated as the ratio between the number
  of significant hits and the expected number of hits. In (D), the number of features
  assigned a putative KEGG ID through pathway analysis associated with DDT exposure
  in worms and with the putative DDT metabolite in human plasma and CSF. In (E), the
  pathways enriched in both species where the number represents enrichment (ratio
  between the number of significant hits and the expected number of hits) and the
  darker red color indicates lower P-value. IMP: inosine monophosphate, FMN: flavin
  mononucleotide, and Ala–Val: alanine–valine dipeptide.'
