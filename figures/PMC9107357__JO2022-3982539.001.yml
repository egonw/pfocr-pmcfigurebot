caption: 'UBE2S expression pattern in cancer and tumor tissues. (a) Divergence in
  UBE2S expression across cancer and normal tissues of TCGA was determined by TIMER2.
  (b) Divergence in UBE2S expression across cancer and corresponding para-cancerous
  tissues from TCGA database. ∗p < 0.05;  ∗∗p < 0.01;  ∗∗∗p < 0.001. (c) Based on
  GEPIA online tool, pathological stage characterizations were identified by UBE2S
  expression in KIRP, KIRC, ACC, LIHC, KICH, BRCA, HNSC, and LUAD of TCGA. TCGA: The
  Cancer Genome Atlas; KIRP: kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma; KIRC: kidney renal
  clear cell carcinoma; ACC: adrenocortical carcinoma; LIHC: liver hepatocellular
  carcinoma; KICH: kidney chromophobe; BRCA: breast invasive carcinoma, HNSC: head
  and neck squamous cell carcinoma; LUAD: lung adenocarcinoma.'
