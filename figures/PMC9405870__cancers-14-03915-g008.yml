caption: FAM107A affects PCa cell migration and invasion through FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway.
  (A,B) AKT activator SC79 partially restores the effect of FAM107A overexpression
  on cell invasion ability. The number of invading PCa cells was quantified using
  ImageJ software. (C,D) Effect of AKT activator SC79 partially restores FAM107A overexpression
  on wound healing assays. Wound healing was quantified using ImageJ software. (E)
  An immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the expression of Vimentin in each
  group of cells at a magnification of 400Ã—. (F) Western blotting analysis of changes
  in key proteins during EMT. (G) Western blotting analysis of changes in key proteins
  during cell cycle and apoptosis.*** for p < 0.001, and ** for p < 0.01.
