caption: DEGs of AD brain from GSE33000 dataset. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs (|logFC|
  > 0.03 and adjusted P value < 0.05). Up-regulated genes were colored in red and
  down-regulated genes were colored in blue. (B) Heatmap of top 100 up and top 100
  down DEGs of GSE33000. (C) GO of DEGs in GSE33000. The top 10 GOs include neutrophil
  activation involved in immune response (GO:0002283), neutrophil degranulation (GO:0043312),
  neutrophil mediated immunity (GO:0002446), regulation of mRNA catabolic process
  (GO:0061013), regulation of cellular ketone metabolic process (GO:0010565), aerobic
  electron transport chain (GO:0019646), cellular protein modification process (GO:0006464),
  regulation of potassium ion transmembrane transport (GO:1901379), mitochondrial
  ATP synthesis coupled electron transport (GO:0042775), and negative regulation of
  extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO:2001237). (D) KEGG of DEGs in GSE33000.
  The top 10 KEGGs include Pathways in cancer, Focal adhesion, Non-alcoholic fatty
  liver disease, MAPK signaling pathway, Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection,
  Dopaminergic synapse, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, Glutamatergic
  synapse, Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
