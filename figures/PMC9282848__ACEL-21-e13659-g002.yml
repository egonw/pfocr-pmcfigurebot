caption: 'LOXL2 regulated the TGF‐β1‐mediated p38 MAPK signaling pathway. (a) D‐gal
  increased the content of TGF‐β1 in fibroblast cells, as assessed by immunofluorescent
  staining. Scale bar = 50 μm. (b) The expression levels of TGF‐β1, p‐p38, and p38.
  (c) LOXL2 inhibitor decreased the protein expression levels of p‐p38 and TGF‐β1
  in D‐gal treated fibroblast cells. β‐Tubulin: internal reference. (d) The expression
  levels of TGF‐β1, p‐p38, and p38. (e) The protein expression levels of p‐p38 and
  TGF‐β1. β‐Tubulin: internal reference. (f) The expression levels of fibrosis‐related
  proteins. (g) SB 203580 further reduced the protein expression levels of Collagen‐III,
  Collagen‐I, and α‐SMA in D‐gal together with LOXL2 inhibitor‐treated fibroblast
  cells. Data are shown as mean ± SD, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 control
  vs. 30 g/L D‐gal. ap < 0.05, aap < 0.01, aaap < 0.001 30 g/L D‐gal vs. LOXL2 inhibitor
  (0.25, 0.5 and 1 μM) or 30 g/L D‐gal vs. LOXL2 inhibitor. SB 203580. bp < 0.05,
  bbp < 0.01, bbbp < 0.001 SB 203580 vs. LOXL2 inhibitor'
