caption: 'GPRC6A knockdown does not restore ucOCN-mediated IL-1β downregulation. (A)
  Western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression of GPRC6A using
  the whole lysate in C2C12 cells. (B, C) The C2C12 cells were transfected with nontargeting
  control siRNA (siCON) or siRNA targeting Gprc6a (siGPRC6A). The efficiency of GPRC6A
  knockdown was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. (D-E)
  C2C12 cells transfected with siCON or siGPRC6A were incubated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL)
  and/or ucOCN (0.5 ng/mL) for 8 hours. The effect of GPRC6A knockdown on mRNA and
  protein levels corresponding to IL-1β was analyzed using quantitative real-time
  PCR and Western blot, respectively. The data represent the mean ± SD of triplicates.
  *P < 0.05 compared to siCON-transfected cells without treatment; #P < 0.05 compared
  to siCON-transfected cells with TNF-α treatment; Brackets show a significant difference
  (P < 0.05) between indicated groups.'
