caption: 'Energy homeostasis in CBS+/− mice supplemented with methionine and fed with
  HFD. Left panel: Study in mice supplemented with methionine and fed with a regular
  diet. (A) Insulin tolerance test (ITT) 0.5 UI/kg bw. (C) The area under curve (AUC)
  of ITT. (E) Oral glucose tolerance test 2 g/kg bw. (G) The AUC of OGTT. (I) Insulin
  secretion at the baseline and in response to OGTT. Right panel (B,D,F,H,J): same
  measurements in mice supplemented with methionine and fed with a high-fat diet,
  Met-HF mice. Data are Means ± SEM. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005 vs. CBS+/+. Analysis
  by two-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni test, and unpaired t-test for AUCs.'
