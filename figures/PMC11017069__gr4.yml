caption: Bubble plot analysis of metabolic pathways in ALV-J-infected CEF cells. Each
  bubble in the bubble chart represents a metabolic pathway (the 20 most significant
  ones were displayed according to the P-value). The larger the bubble, the more metabolites
  it contains. The x-axis represents the path influence value in topology analysis,
  and its size is positively correlated with the influence factor. The y-axis represents
  the P-value of metabolic pathways in enrichment analysis; The darker the color and
  the smaller the P-value indicate a more significant degree of enrichment.
