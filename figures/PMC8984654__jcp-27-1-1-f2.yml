  transplantation experiments
caption: (A) When AKTP (p53+/R270H) cells are transplanted to the spleen, AKTP (p53R270/LOH)
  cells are enriched in metastatic foci in the liver. Loss of wild-type p53 by LOH
  causes the activation of stemness, growth factor signaling and the inflammatory
  pathway, which may contribute to metastasis. (B) AKTP cells arrested in the sinusoid
  (brown circle) activate HSCs, leading to the development of micrometastasis in the
  liver with generation of the fibrotic niche (top). AP cells do not activate HSCs
  and metastatic foci are not formed (middle). When AKTP and AP cells are co-disseminated,
  both AKTP and AP cells survive and form chimeric metastasis with the fibrotic niche
  (bottom). HSCs, hepatic stellate cells; GOF, gain-of-function. Modified from the
  article of Kok et al. (Nat Commun 2021;12:863) (Fig. 7) [].
