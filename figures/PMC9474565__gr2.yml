caption: Dataflow for computing pathway activation. Based on patient imaging and brain
  atlases, Lead-DBS (orange box) reconstructs the electrode and provides a description
  of tissue and water diffusion distributions in the brain. These data are used by
  OSS-DBS (green box) to create an accurate patient-specific volume conductor model.
  The model is then employed to compute electric potential distribution in space and
  time along axon models allocated on trajectories described by a pathway atlas. Finally,
  for the given distribution, the cable equation is solved to probe axonal activation,
  i.e. occurrence of an action potential in response to DBS.
