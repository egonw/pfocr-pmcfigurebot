caption: 'HTR2A antagonist AT1015 inhibits the melanogenesis promotion effect of 5-HT
  in B16F10 cells and zebrafish embryos: (a) Masson–Fonta staining of B16F10 cells
  to show the melanocytes morphology and melanin content with the treatment of 5-HT
  (100 μM), HTR2A antagonist AT1015 (3 μM), and cotreatment. Scale bar, 50 μm; (b,c)
  relative tyrosinase activity (b) and melanin content (c) in B16F10 cells treated
  with 5-HT (100 μM) and different concentrations of AT1015 (0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 μM)
  as compared with the control (n = 6). The photos of melanin precipitation in the
  tube are at the top of the diagram (c); (d) Western blot shows the protein expression
  of melanin synthesis, MITF, and TYR in B16F10 cells treated with 5-HT (100 μM) or
  cotreated with AT1015 (3 μM) or ketanserin (30 μM); (e) the morphology of melanocytes
  in zebrafish embryos at 60 hpf. The left column shows the whole view of zebrafish
  embryos (lateral view). The right three columns show the amplification photos of
  head (lateral view), trunk (lateral view), and head (dorsal view). Scale bar, 100
  μm. * (p < 0.05) and ** (p < 0.01) compared to control group; # (p < 0.05) and ##
  (p < 0.01) compared to 5-HT group.'
