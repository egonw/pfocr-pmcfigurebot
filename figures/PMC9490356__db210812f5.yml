caption: Elevated mTOR signaling in MSCs from offspring born to mothers with higher
  FFAs during pregnancy. Following myogenesis, protein quantification was conducted
  on members of the insulin/IGF/mTOR signaling pathway, including Akt (C), mTOR (D),
  p70S6kT421/S424 (E), and p85S6kT444/S447 (F), in offspring MSCs (n = 6–10 per group).
  Group comparisons for AktS473, mTORS2448, p70S6kT421/S424, and p85S6kT444/S447 were
  analyzed via Student t test. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed data for mTOR did
  not follow a normal distribution, and therefore Mann-Whitney test was used for group
  comparisons. *P ≤ 0.05. AU, arbitrary unit.
