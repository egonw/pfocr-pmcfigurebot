figure_title: Fatostatin inhibits proliferation and EMT and induces ferroptosis by
  suppressing the AKT/mTORC1 pathway
caption: A, B The changes in colony numbers in U87 and U251 cells were reversed by
  SC79 or MHY1485. C CCK-8 assay results showed that the changes in U87 and U251 cells
  were reversed by SC79 or MHY1485. D Transwell assays revealed that the changes in
  the invasion of U87 and U251 cells were reversed by SC79 or MHY1485. E The changes
  in expression of E-ca, N-ca, Snail1, and Vimentin in U87 and U251 cells treated
  with fatostatin (20 μM) for 24 h were reversed by SC79 or MHY1485. F The changes
  in the GSH levels in U87 and U251 cells were reversed by SC79 or MHY1485. G After
  DMSO, fatostatin, fatostatin+SC79, or fatostatin+MHY1485 treatment, U87 cells were
  prepared for transmission electron microscopy observation. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001; ns no significance.
