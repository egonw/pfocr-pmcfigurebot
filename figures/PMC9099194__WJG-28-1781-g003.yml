caption: 'Effect of forkhead Box q1 expression on heparin binding epidermal growth
  factor expression and extracellular release ability in colorectal cancer cells.
  A: Quantitative analysis of western blots was performed to detect the expression
  of heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) with forkhead Box q1 (FOXQ1)
  inhibition; B: Flow cytometry was performed to detect the effect of changes in FOXQ1
  expression on the expression of proHB-EGF in DLD1 and SW480 cells; C: ELISA verified
  the effect of FOXQ1 knockdown on sHB-EGF expression in DLD1 and SW480 cells; D:
  ELISA confirmed the effect of FOXQ1 on the expression of proHB-EGF extracellular
  release proteins (ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM12 and MMP-7) in DLD1 and SW480 cells. aP <
  0.05; bP < 0.01; cP < 0.001. FOXQ1: Forkhead Box q1; HB-EGF: Heparin binding epidermal
  growth factor; ProHB-EGF: Membrane-bound HB-EGF; SHB-EGF: Souble HB-EGF; ADAM9:
  A disintegrin and a metalloprotease 9; ADAM10: A disintegrin and a metalloprotease
  10; ADAM12: A disintegrin and a metalloprotease 12; MMP7: Matrix metallopeptidase
  7.'
