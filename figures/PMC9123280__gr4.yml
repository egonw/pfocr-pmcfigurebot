caption: LIF activates the STAT3 signaling pathway in vitro. A, cellular TG contents.
  HepG2 cells were exposed to high glucose (HG, 30 mM) plus insulin (100 nM) or low
  glucose (LG, 5 mM) as a control for 48 h and then were treated with recombinant
  human LIF protein (10 ng/ml) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a vehicle control
  for 1.5 h. B–E, expression of genes involved in de novo synthesis (B), β-oxidation
  (C), lipid transport (D), and esterification process (E) in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells
  were treated with recombinant LIF protein (10 ng/ml) or PBS for 1.5 h, with preincubation
  with HG (30 mM) plus insulin (100 nM) or LG (5 mM) for 48 h. F, Western blot analysis
  of expression of STAT3, mTOR, AMPK, and JNK pathways. HepG2 cells were treated with
  recombinant LIF protein (10 ng/ml) or PBS for 0.5 h, with preincubation with HG
  (30 mM) plus insulin (100 nM) or LG (5 mM) for 48 h. G, Western blot analysis of
  expression of STAT3. HepG2 cells were treated with recombinant LIF protein (10 ng/ml)
  or PBS for 0.5 h, with or without preincubation with S31 to 201 (100 μM), a STAT3
  inhibitor, for 24 h. H and I, cellular TG contents (H) and expression of genes involved
  in de novo synthesis (I). HepG2 cells were treated with recombinant LIF protein
  (10 ng/ml) or PBS for 1.5 h, with preincubation with HG (30 mM) plus insulin (100 nM)
  for 24 h, with or without preincubation with S31 to 201 (100 μM) for 24 h. n = 3
  per each group. Data are presented as mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p <
  0.001. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LIF, leukemia
  inhibitory factor; mTOR, mammalian target for rapamycin; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3.
