caption: 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway after combined treatment. N mRNA expression of (A)PIK3CA,
  (B)AKT1, (C)mTOR, (D)S6KB1, (E)PDK1, (F)SLC2A1, (G)PRKAA1, (H)PRKAA2 in both populations
  (P and 10GT) of SCC13 cell line by RT-PCR after incubation with metformin (24 h,
  75 μM), PDT (0.3 mM MAL following 23 J/cm2 red light) and combined treatment (metformin
  plus PDT). (I) Expression by western blot of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway components: pAMPK, AMPK, pAKT, AKT, p-p70S6K
  and p-p70S6K after treatments (metformin, MAL-PDT, and metformin plus MAL-PDT).
  A representative experiment of each marker is shown, and pAMPK/AMPK, pAKT/AKT, and
  p-p70S6K/p70S6K densitometry graphics of both P and resistant populations of SCC13
  and A431 cells are shown. Α-tubulin was used as loading control. Values were represented
  as mean ± SD (∗: p< 0.05; ∗∗: p< 0.01; ∗∗∗: p< 0.001) (n = 3) M + P: metformin + PDT.'
