caption: The biofunction pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes regulated
  by CD47-overexpression in oral cancer cells. (A) The network analysis report of
  upregulated genes by CD47-overexpression in OECM-1 and OC-2 cells. Molecular focus
  gene was involved in top diseases and function. (B) Three identified genes, HSPA5,
  HYOU1, and PDIA4, were found to be involved in molecular functions, biological processes,
  and cellular components in OSCC. (C,D) CD47, HSPA5, HYOU1, and PDIA4 gene expression
  and survival was analyzed using the HPA database. Cut off FPKM of 25%, 50%, and
  75% were used to find the survival rate, respectively. R; correlation coefficient;
  two-tailed Student’s t-test. (E,F) The expression of HSPA5 was examined in CD47-overexpressing
  OECM-1 and OC-2 cells using qPCR. (G,J) HSPA5 and CD47 gene expression was analyzed
  by qPCR and (H,I) cell growth was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. The data are presented
  as the mean ± SD of three experiments. * p < 0.05 vs. empty control; two-tailed
  Student’s t-test.
