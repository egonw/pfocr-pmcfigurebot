caption: Noncanonical Wnt signaling. (a) In the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway,
  Wnt binds to Fz independent of its LRP5/6 coreceptor and activates Dsh. The activated
  Dsh with the help of Daam1 activates Rac and Rho which in turn activate c-Jun-N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) and Rho kinase (ROCK), respectively. ROCK and JNK cause cytoskeletal
  changes that contribute to cell polarization. (b) In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway, the signal
  is transduced by the binding of Wnt to Fz which activates Dsh. Dsh via phospholipase-C
  (PLC) activates inositol triphosphate (IP3) without the involvement of Daam1 like
  in PCP. This triggers the release of intracellular Ca2+ which in turn activates
  Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) and protein kinase C (PKC).
  This promotes the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells
  (NFACT) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (not shown), which later
  binds to its target gene and regulates gene expression.
