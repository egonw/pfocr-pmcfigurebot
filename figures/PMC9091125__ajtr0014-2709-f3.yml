caption: 'TLR4 was a potential downstream target of SPI1. (A) Pathway enrichment analyses
  of the candidate downstream genes of SPI1; (B) Downstream genes of SPI1 enriched
  in the inflammation- and apoptosis-related signaling pathways; (C) The intersected
  gene in several related signaling pathways; (D, E) mRNA (D) and protein (E) levels
  of TLR4 in infarcted border zone in cardiac tissues of model mice and sham-operated
  ones detected by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis (n = 10); (F, G) mRNA (F) and
  protein (G) levels of TLR4 in hypoxia-treated HL-1 cells evaluated by RT-qPCR and
  western blot analysis. All data are presented as mean ± SD. For cellular experiments,
  repetition = 3. Differences were analyzed by the unpaired t test (D and E) or one-way
  ANOVA (F and G). *P < 0.05 vs. the sham group; #P < 0.05 vs. the control group (normoxic
  condition); &P < 0.05 vs. the si-NC group.'
