caption: Effects of different treatment times of HG on autophagy in MDBK cells. MDBK
  cells were treated with 25.5 mM glucose for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively.
  Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to assess protein expression, and gene expression,
  respectively. (A,B) The protein level of LC3-II/I, p62, and Beclin1; (C) The mRNA
  expression level of LC3B, p62, and Beclin1. ** p < 0.01 compared with control group.
