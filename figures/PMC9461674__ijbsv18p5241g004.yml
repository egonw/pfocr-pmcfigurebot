caption: 'SPC25 upregulates the expression of stemness-related markers. (A-E) Human
  stem cell proteome array (A-B) (POS: Positive Control Spots; NEG: Negative Control
  Spots) and PCR array (C-E) for stemness typical markers in indicated HCC cell lines.
  (F-G) Western blot analysis of the expression of several stemness markers (CD133,
  OCT4, c-Myc, NANOG, and SOX2) (F) and EMT-related genes (vimentin, N-cadherin, and
  E-cadherin) (G) in Hep3B-vector, Hep3B-SPC25, Huh7-vector, Huh7-SPC25, HepG2-siControl,
  HepG2-siSPC25-1, and HepG2-siSPC25-2 cells. (H-I) IF staining for the cell colonization
  of Sox2 (H) and Nanog (I) in Huh7-vector, Huh7-SPC25, HepG2-siControl, HepG2-siSPC25-1,
  and HepG2-siSPC25-2 cells. (J) Representative images of the IHC staining showing
  the correlation between SPC25 expression and Sox2 expression (K) Representative
  images of IHC staining showing the correlation between SPC25 expression and Nanog
  expression. (L) Correlation analysis demonstrating the association between the IHC
  grades of Sox2 and SPC25 in 142 HCC patients and the relative expression levels
  of Sox2 and SPC25 on the TCGA database. (M) Correlation analysis demonstrating the
  association between the IHC grades of Nanog and SPC25 in 142 HCC patients and the
  relative expression levels of Nanog and SPC25 on the TCGA database. Error bars represent
  the mean Â± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; ns means non-significant.'
