caption: Effects of TSG-6 siRNA treatment in ASCs and macrophages. To inhibit TSG-6
  expression in ASCs and macrophages, ASCs/macrophages or LX-2 cells were seeded in
  the upper or lower chamber of Transwell wells, respectively. (A) TSG-6 expression
  in ASCs and macrophages 48 h after transfection of TSG-6 siRNA. (B) α-SMA expression
  in TGF-β-treated LX-2 cells 48 h after transfection of TSG-6 siRNA. Data were obtained
  from one of three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, and *** p <
  0.001. ns, no statistical significance.

  Cells during Coculture of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Macrophages via the JAK/STAT
  Signaling Pathway.
