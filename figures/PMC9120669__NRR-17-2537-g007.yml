caption: 'OSA aggravates pyroptosis after SAH in vivo via the HIF-1α/ASC signaling
  pathway.(A, B) OSA increases HIF-1α (A) and ASC (B) mRNA expression of in the left
  cortex, as detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. (C) Detection of HIF-1α
  and ASC in left cortex samples by western blot. (D, E) HIF-1α (D) and ASC (E) expression
  (normalized to β-actin) relative to the control. OSA increases HIF-1α expression
  following SAH in mice. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5). *P < 0.05 (one-way
  analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). ASC: Apoptosis associated
  speck like protein containing a CARD; HIF-1α: hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; OSA:
  obstructive sleep apnea; SAH: subarachnoid hemorrhage.'

  in early brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage via ASC/HIF-1α pathway.
