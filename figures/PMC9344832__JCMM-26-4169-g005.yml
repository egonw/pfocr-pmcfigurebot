caption: 'Activation of IL‐17 signalling pathway inhibits the function improvement
  of human breast milk (HBM)‐Exo. (A) Cell proliferation in the control, hyperoxia,
  hyperoxia with HBM‐Exo treatment group, as well as hyperoxiawith HBM‐Exo treatment
  plus IL‐17 cytokines group by CCK8 kit; (B) SPC protein expression in the control,
  hyperoxia and hyperoxia +HBM‐Exo treatment group, as well as hyperoxia with HBM‐Exo
  treatment plus IL‐17 cytokines group by immunoflurescenc. (C) Cell apoptosis in
  the control, hyperoxia, and hyperoxia with HBM‐Exo treatment group, as well as hyperoxia
  with HBM‐Exo treatment plus IL‐17 cytokines group by flow cytometry. Data represent
  results from 3 individual studies. The pictures shown are representative. Unpaired
  t‐test, */#p < 0.05, **/##p < 0.01, ***/###p < 0.001. Con: control, Exo: HBM‐Exo,
  Hyp: Hyperoxia, C‐Caspas: cleaved‐caspase. * VS Con, # VS BPD. The concentration
  of HBM‐Exo: 15.4 μg/ml protein'
