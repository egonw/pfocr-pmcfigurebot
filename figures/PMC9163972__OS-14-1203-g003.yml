caption: Bnd inhibited osteoclasts via the NFκB signaling pathway. (A) Heatmap of
  RNA‐seq data showing that CCL2, CCL7, CCR2 and CCR3 levels were decreased in the
  Bnd group. (B) Scatter plot of KEGG pathway enrichment results for the DEGs showing
  that osteoclast differentiation was increased markedly in the Bnd group. (C–E) p‐IKKα/β
  and p‐p65 protein expression was significantly increased in osteoclast precursors
  7 days after induction (IN) (P = 0.008), but Bnd (200 μM) attenuated this increase
  (n = 5 per group) (P = 0.037). Equal loading was confirmed by assessment of GAPDH.
  Bnd inhibited osteoclastogenesis via the NFκB signaling pathway by inhibiting the
  synthesis of CCL2 and CCL7. All differences were tested using one‐way ANOVA and
  Tukey's test; ns, not significant; *P < 0.01, **P < 0.001.
