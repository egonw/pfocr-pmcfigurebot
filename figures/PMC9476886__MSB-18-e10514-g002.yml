figure_title: A parsimonious mathematical model recapitulates experimental results
  demonstrating exact adaptation, pulsatile coding, and adaptation to the magnitude
  of the first derivative
caption: A, B Experimental results and model simulations of calcium levels in response
  to a step function (A) and to a smooth sigmoidal function (B) of the stimulus. (A)
  Following an on step, and during stimulus presentation, calcium levels rise and
  then return to their basal levels (exact adaptation in experiment and simulation).
  Receptor activity () and inhibition levels () reach a new steady state. (B) A sigmoidal
  gradient of the stimulus elicits a series of calcium pulses that are stronger in
  the first half of the sigmoid, thus demonstrating adaptation to the gradient's first
  derivative (dashed line marks the sigmoid midpoint, where the first derivative is
  maximal). This feature is observed in both experiments and simulations. The stair‐shape
  inhibition constitutes a discrete memory of previous input levels. Top two panels
  show the gradient and its derivative. Middle panels depict a representative result
  of AWA calcium imaging. The two bottom panels present calcium concentrations (),
  receptor activation (), and inhibition () levels as simulated by the model for the
  same gradient. Calcium dynamics was measured using a strain expressing GCaMP in
  the AWA neuron and is denoted as the GCaMP fluorescence fold change from the initial
  state . Diacetyl (stimulus) was presented to the worm using a custom‐made microfluidic
  device (see Materials and Methods).  Source data are available online for this figure.
