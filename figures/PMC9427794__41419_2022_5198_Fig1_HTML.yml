figure_title: Altered GASP1 in breast cancers and its association with patient survival
caption: a Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the level of GASP1 in breast
  cancers and normal breast tissues (n = 20). Scale bar, 200 µm. b GASP1 expression
  in different stages of breast cancer patients (data from TCGA database). c GASP1
  expression in different breast cancer subgroups, including luminal, HER2 positive,
  and Triple-negative types (data from UALCAN platform). d A total of 5% (54/1084)
  of breast cancers exhibit GASP1 alterations (data from cBioPortal). e The frequency
  of GASP1 alterations in different pathological types of breast cancer, including
  mutation, genomic amplification, and high mRNA expression (data from cBioPortal).
  Numbers 1, 2, and 3 represent Invasive Mixed Mucinous Carcinoma, Invasive Lobular
  Carcinoma, and Invasive Carcinoma (NOS, respectively. f The association of GASP1
  alterations with disease-specific survival and overall survival in breast cancer
  patients. Data were presented as mean ± SD. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
article_title: GASP1 enhances malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells and decreases
  their response to paclitaxel by forming a vicious cycle with IGF1/IGF1R signaling
  pathway.
