caption: 'The effect of MSCs-Exo on hippocampus ferroptosis in dNCR mice is mediated
  by the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups:
  Sham group, dNCR group, dNCR+MSCs-Exo group, and dNCR+Fer-1 group. (a–c) Nrf2 and
  HO-1 expressions in each group were determined by Western blot. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM (n = 5/group). ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, Sham vs. dNCR; ##P < 0.01
  and ###P < 0.001, dNCR vs. dNCR+ MSCs-Exo; @@P < 0.01 and @@@P < 0.001, dNCR vs.
  dNCR+Fer-1. Fer-1: ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor.'
