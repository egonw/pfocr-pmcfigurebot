caption: Pathway analysis of the degradome transcripts. Target transcript function
  was obtained using UniProt database and the RAP-DB and GO annotations. (A) Pathway
  categorization is presented in the form of percentage of the total number transcripts.
  The total number of transcripts represents transcripts cleaved after removal of
  hypothetical, unpredicted, and unknown samples, as well as samples with significant
  log2 FC and p-values (B) Pathway categorization of percentage of transcripts based
  on up- or down-DEms.
