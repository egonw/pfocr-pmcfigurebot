caption: SH2B1 directly binds to HSC70 and activates HSC70 pathway to attenuate SH-SY5Y
  cell apoptosis. (a and b) Base peak the LC-mass spectra of the SH2B1-bound proteins
  (a) and the proteins with the top 10 detected peptide hits in the mass spectrometry
  study (b). (c) SH2B1-bound proteins in SH-SY5Y cell lysates were identified by LC-MS/MS,
  and the bound heat shock family proteins are listed. (d) Cell lysates from SH-SY5Y
  cells were subjected to IP for SH2B1/HSC70, and eluted proteins were subjected to
  WB analysis using anti-HSC70 and anti-SH2B1 antibodies. (e) Lysates from control
  and MPP+ (200 μM, 24 h)-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells were used for IP for SH2B1. (f)
  Confocal image showing the colocalization of SH2B1 and HSC70 in SH-SY5Y cells. Scale
  bar, 10 μm. (g–j) SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with SH2B1 plasmid (or EV) and
  LV-shHSPA8 (or LV-shMOCK) for 24 h and treated with (or without) MPP+ for an additional
  24 h. Cell lysates were extracted for immunoblot analysis of CASP3 (g and h) and
  fixed for Hoechst staining (i and j). Scale bar, 20 μm. All data are presented as
  the mean ± SEM. n = 3–4 per group in (g–j); three independent experiments. Analysed
  by (j) two-tailed Student's t-test or (h) one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test.
