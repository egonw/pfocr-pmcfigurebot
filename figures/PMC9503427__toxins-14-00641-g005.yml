caption: Resveratrol enhanced PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway in zearalenone-exposed
  porcine oocytes. (A) Fluorescence localization of Parkin. Bar = 20 Î¼m. Typical intracellular
  fluorescent distributions were given representing different oocyte treatments. (B)
  Statistical analysis of relative fluorescence intensity of Parkin. (C) Protein expressions
  of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy determined by Western blotting. (D) Statistical
  analysis of protein expressions. Independent replications were performed three times
  in each experiment. Different lowercase letters on the statistical graphs indicated
  significant differences between treatments (p-value < 0.05).
