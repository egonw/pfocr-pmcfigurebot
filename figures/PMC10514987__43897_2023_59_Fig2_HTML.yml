caption: Schematic representation of the major pathway of secondary metabolite biosynthesis
  and its interrelationships with primary metabolites. Primary metabolites are interconnected
  with secondary metabolism by producing secondary metabolite compounds through the
  biosynthetic pathway. Types of biosynthetic pathways in plant secondary metabolism
  are shikimic acid (shikimate), malonic acid (malonate), mevalonic acid (mevalonate),
  and methylerythritol-phosphate pathways. Plant secondary metabolites (SMs) are mainly
  divided into three different groups, including terpenes, phenolics and nitrogen-containing
  compounds, derived from photosynthesis as the primary carbon metabolism process
  through the four biosynthetic pathways
