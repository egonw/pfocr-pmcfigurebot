caption: 'Potential crosstalk between PGE2signaling and tumorigenic pathways in NB.
  Upon activation by PGE2, the Gα subunit released from EP receptors can induce the
  PKA-associated phosphorylation of Ras, which subsequently activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  signaling. Meanwhile, Gα may also interact with axin to activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. On the other hand, the freed Gβγ subunits can induce the PI3K/Akt signaling,
  which may interact with mTOR and NF-κB to induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  genes and oncogenes. Akt can also phosphory-late GSK-3β and stabilize β-catenin
  signaling. In addition, β-arrestin/Src complex released upon EP receptor activation
  may induce the Ras/MAPK pathway, which might contribute to the progression of NB.
