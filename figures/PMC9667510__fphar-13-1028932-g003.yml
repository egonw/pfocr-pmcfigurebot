caption: '(A) Flow Cytometry of the cell cycle, when the concentrations were 10 μM
  and 30 μM, the percent of the S phase significantly increased when compared with
  the control group (p < 0.001, respectively). (B) Flow Cytometry of cell apoptosis
  in the Q2 phase significantly decreased when the concentrations were 10 μM and 30 μM
  (p < 0.05, respectively). (C) Flow Cytometry of ROS level significantly decreased
  when the concentrations were 10 μM and 30 μM (p < 0.05, respectively). (D) Immunofluorescence
  of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) significantly decreased when the concentrations
  were 10 μM and 30 μM (p < 0.01, respectively). Note: MF, Mangiferin. Ctrl, osteogenic
  induction group.'
