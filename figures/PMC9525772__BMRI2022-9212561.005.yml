caption: 'Effect of TJZYF on rats'' endometrial receptivity. (a) Histopathological
  HE staining of endometrial tissue of rats in each group. Scale bar = 50 μm (magnification,
  ×200). (b) Treatment effects on endometrium thickness (×40) and (c) (×100), and
  (d) mean endometrium thickness statistics (n = 10). (e) Embryo implantation statistics
  of rats in each group (n = 10). (f) The pinocytosis of endometrial epithelium under
  an electron microscope. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. model; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs.
  TJZYF based on one-way ANOVA and Tukey''s tests.'
