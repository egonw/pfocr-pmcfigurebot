caption: 'Cysteine metabolism map. The catabolism of cysteine involves seven pathways
  producing pyruvate, hydrogen sulfide, alanine or taurine. (1) In the first step,
  cysteine is converted to mercaptopyruvate in deamination reaction catalyzed by cysteine
  transaminase (CGT, EC 2.6.1.3). Subsequently, mercaptopyruvate is changed to pyruvate
  on the trans-sulfuration way by 3−mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST, EC 2.8.1.2)—the
  ‘mercaptopyruvate pathway’. Cysteine in reactions catalyzed by (2) cysteine desulfhydrase
  (CDS, EC 4.4.1.15) and (3) cystathionine β−lyase (CBL, EC 4.4.1.8) is directly converted
  to pyruvate and H2S (only CBL). (4) D−cysteine is formed from L−cysteine by the
  action of amino acid racemase (AAR, EC 5.1.1.10). (5) Cysteine is in dynamic equilibrium
  with cystine, which can be converted to thiocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by
  cystathionine γ−lyase (CTH, EC 4.4.1.1) and, in the following step, into H2S or
  persulfide. Conversion of persulfide into thiosulfate is catalyzed by thiosulfate
  sulfurtransferase (TST, EC 2.8.1.1) in the ‘thiosulfate cycle’. (6) Cysteine is
  transformed to 3−sulfinoalanine by cysteine dioxygenase (CDO, EC 1.13.11.20) via
  oxidation of a sulfhydryl group. Then, 3−sulfinoalanine can be converted to: (a)
  3−sulfinopyruvate in a reaction catalyzed by aspartate transaminase (AAT, EC 2.6.1.1),
  which is further transformed to pyruvate; (b) to alanine by desulfinase (EC 4.1.1.12)
  in the ‘alanine pathway’; and (c) to taurine by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase (CSAD,
  EC 4.1.1.29) and hypotaurine dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.3) in the ‘taurine pathway’.
  (7) Cysteine can also be transformed to cysteate in reaction catalyzed by cysteine
  lyase (EC 4.4.1.10) and then to taurine by action of CSAD. Glutamate cystine ligase
  (GCL, EC 6.3.2.2) and glutathione synthase (GSS, EC 6.3.2.3) catalyze glutathione
  synthesis from cysteine. Further metabolism between methionine and cysteine is regulated
  by CTH, cystathionine β−synthase (CBS, EC 4.2.1.22) and methionine synthase (MS,
  EC 2.1.1.13). Red arrows show changes in sulfur metabolism caused by the GAGs accumulation
  (modified according to []).'
