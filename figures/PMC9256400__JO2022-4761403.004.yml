caption: The pseudo-time-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detection and
  enrichment analysis of biological functions. After selecting the appropriate cell
  principal components (a), the pseudo-time analysis was applied based on the monocle
  algorithm (b, c). (d) The analysis results presented the GO functional analysis
  results of biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions
  (MF), respectively. (e) The results of the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The
  nodes' size represented the negative log10 p value for illustrative purposes. (f)
  The volcano plot showed the differentially expressed genes in pseudo-time analysis.
  (g) The compartmentalized protein-protein interaction of FABP1 was constructed based
  on the COMPPI database.
