figure_title: ESCRT-I dysfunction causes enlargement of lysosomes in RKO cells
caption: '(A) Maximum intensity projection confocal images of live RKO cells, showing
  the intracellular distribution of lysosomes stained with LysoTracker dye (red) under
  control conditions (nontargeting siRNAs, Ctrl#1 or #2) and upon depletion of ESCRT-I
  subunits, Tsg101, or Vps28 (using two single siRNAs for each subunit, #1 or #2).
  Cell nuclei marked with Hoechst stain (blue). Scale bar, 50 μm. (A, B) Dot plots
  showing average fluorescence intensity of LysoTracker expressed in arbitrary units
  (a.u.; top panel) and the mean area (bottom panel) of detected lysosomal structures
  in control or ESCRT-depleted cells, calculated based on live-cell microscopy images
  (shown in A). Values derived from independent experiments (dots) and their means
  (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance tested by comparison to averaged
  values measured for siCtrl#1 and #2. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (C) Maximum
  intensity projection confocal images of fixed control and ESCRT-I–depleted cells
  showing intracellular distribution of cathepsin D, stained with pepstatin A conjugated
  to BODIPY FL (green), as compared to late endosomes/lysosomes, detected using anti-LAMP-1
  antibody (red). Cell nuclei marked with DAPI stain (blue). Scale bar, 20 μm. The
  dot plot on the right shows average BODIPY FL fluorescence intensity of LAMP-1–positive
  structures calculated based on confocal images. Values derived from independent
  experiments and their means (n = 4 ± SEM) are presented. Statistical significance
  tested by comparison to averaged value measured for siCtrl-treated cells (AveCtrl).
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (D) Representative EM images of control and ESCRT-I–depleted
  cells showing the morphology and size of lysosomes (indicated by yellow arrowheads).
  Scale bar, 500 nm.'
