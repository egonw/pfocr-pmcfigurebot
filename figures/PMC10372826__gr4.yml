caption: The decreased mRNA levels of progesterone synthesis enzymes and PGR expression
  in the mice of PPOS group(A–D) Star (A, n = 9–10 mice in each group), Cyp11a (B,
  n = 9–10 mice in each group), Hsd3B2 (C, n = 10 mice in each group), and Cyp19a
  (D, n = 7–10 mice in each group) relative mRNA levels in the PPOS and control groups
  at 4 h after hCG injection.(E) Immunofluorescence images of PGR expression on the
  preovulatory follicles in the PPOS and control groups at 6 h after hCG injection
  (n = 3–5 mice in each group). Scale bar, 50 μm.(F) The relative PGR fluorescence
  intensity within control and PPOS groups analyzed by ImageJ software (n = 6 preovulatory
  follicles within 3–5 mice in each group).(G) PGR relative mRNA expression levels
  at 4 h after hCG injection within two groups (n = 7–9 mice in each group).Statistical
  analysis was performed by Mann-Whitney test in A–D, F-G. Data are represented as
  mean ± SEM. ns, no significance (p ≥ 0.05). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.
