caption: 'Gypenosides suppresses bladder cancer progression in vivo. (a) The excised
  and photographed tumors of mice xenotransplanted with human 5637 cells after 21
  days of treatment. (b) The tumor volume and weight (c) at the endpoints of subcutaneous
  xenograft tumors generated by drug treatment and control in nude mice (n = 6 for
  each group). Student''s t-test, mean ± SD are given, ∗P < 0.05. (d) Representative
  images of the HE staining of mice liver and kidney tissues of the different groups.
  Scale bars, 100 μm. (e) Immunohistochemical staining showing the expression levels
  of PI3K and Ki-67 in xenograft tumors (n = 6 for each group). Scale bars: 100 μm.
  Student''s t-test. Error bars, mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05.'
