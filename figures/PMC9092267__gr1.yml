caption: Clinical presentation of patients with CSNK2B variantsFront and side views
  of subjects 1–3 diagnosed with IDCS show strikingly similar facial gestalt, whereas
  subjects 4 and 5 diagnosed with POBINDS show vivid difference of facial gestalt,
  and no obvious digital or limb anomaly was recorded as in IDCS. Digital anomalies
  of IDCS patients are shown in two panels on right side. For subject 1, arrows show
  brachydactyly 2–5 and syndactyly 2–3 of the digits of the feet. Notably, preoperative
  radiographs of the hands and teeth are shown for subject 1.
