caption: Summary of the study. This figure illustrates the main metabolic pathways
  and findings involved in this study. UGDH catalyses UDP‐glucose into UDP‐glucuronic
  acid, an indispensable unit for glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans and extracellular
  matrix. In this study, UGDH was found to be highly expressed in the mesenchymal
  cells and affect cancer patient survival, mesenchymal cell proliferation and invasion
  and the EMT transcription factor SNAI1, and it was under the control of the PDGFRB‐NFκB
  pathway. In addition, the knock‐down of UGDH with siRNAs significantly decreased
  the intracellular GPC levels and increased the acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in all
  the mesenchymal cell lines. NAA is closely linked to the central carbon metabolism
  and potentially affected by the mass‐action effects of UGDH knock‐down. GPC is an
  intracellular osmolyte and part of the choline metabolism. Knock‐down of UGDH hindered
  the formation of proteoglycans and further decreased the extracellular osmotic pressure,
  which could be counteracted by the reduced intracellular osmotic pressure induced
  by GPC. Based on the literature, we hypothesized that to ease the osmotic stress,
  knock‐down of UGDH affected PPARλ‐lipid metabolism and/or pERK‐PLA2G15 to regulate
  GPC. However, further studies are needed to address this question. UGDH, UDP‐glucose
