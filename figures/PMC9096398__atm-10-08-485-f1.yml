caption: BBR inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells. (A) The
  A549 and PC9 cells were treated with various concentrations of BBR for 24, 48, and
  72 h. Cell viability was analyzed by CCK-8 assays. (B) Morphological changes were
  assessed via microscopy after a 48-h treatment (20×). (C) The A549 and PC9 cells
  were treated with a range of BBR concentrations (0, 40, and 80 μM) for 48 h, after
  which Annexin V/PI staining was used to evaluate apoptotic death by flow cytometry.
  (D) The apoptotic rates were quantified. (E) After the same treatment described
  in (C), CL-caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in the NSCLC cells were measured by western
  blotting. (F) The protein levels from (E) were quantified. The data are presented
  as the mean ± standard deviation for the three different experiments with triplicate
  sets in each assay. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, and nsP>0.05. BBR, berberine; NSCLC, non-small
  cell lung cancer; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8.
