caption: Overexpressing miR-200b inactivated ERK1/2, JNK, and Wnt pathway in GC. CAFs
  transfected with miR-200b mimics or miR-NC were co-cultured with GC cells. (A-D)
  Western blot was conducted to determine the activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and Wnt/β-catenin
  (including β-catenin, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1) in CAF-cultured GC cells. *, P<0.05;
  **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001 (vs. CAFsi-NC group), N=3. GC, gastric cancer; CAFs, cancer-associated
  fibroblasts.
article_title: Interfering HMGB3 release from cancer-associated fibroblasts by miR-200b
  represses chemoresistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of gastric cancer
  cells.
