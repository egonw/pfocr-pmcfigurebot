figure_title: PLEKHH2 binds to β-arrestin1 through its FERM domain and promotes FAK
  phosphorylation, PI3K/AKT pathway activity, and cell malignant phenotype
caption: A The GEPIA database showed that PLEKHH2 was significantly positively correlated
  with ARRB1 (β-arrestin1) level. B Endogenous β-arrestin1 and PLEKHH2 are co-localized
  in the cytoplasm. C Endogenous β-arrestin1 interact with both PLEKHH2 and FAK in
  A549 and H1299 cells. D In lung cancer cells, transfection with the full-length
  PLEKHH2 decreased the interaction of β-arrestin1 and FAK compared with that of the
  empty vector. Transfection with a PLEKHH2 mutant with a FERM domain deletion has
  no effect on decreasing β-arrestin1 binding to FAK. E Western blotting showed that
  PLEKHH2-ΔFERM did not significantly enhance p-FAK, p-PI3K, p-AKT, and proliferation-
  and invasion-related proteins compared to transfection with full-length PLEKHH2.
  At the same time, transfection with PLEKHH2-ΔFERM had did not significantly promote
  cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as evidenced by the results of the
  clone formation assay (F), CCK-8 assay (G), and Matrigel Transwell assay (H). P < 0.05
  indicates statistical significance, *P < 0.05. Statistical analysis is shown in
  Supplementary Fig.  and Supplementary Fig. A-B.
