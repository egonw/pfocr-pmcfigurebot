figure_title: Mechanism for Semaphorin 5A action on abnormal activation of RA SFs
caption: SMs secrete a large amount of Semaphorin 5A, leading to an increased level
  of Semaphorin 5A in the synovial fluid. Semaphorin 5A then binds to Plexin-A1 and
  Plexin-B3 on SFs and activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Activated mTORC1
  signaling inhibits lipid peroxidation, ROS production, and ferroptosis by increasing
  the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, leading to increased protein synthesis of GPX4, and
  also by activating downstream SREBP1/SCD-1 signaling. Reduced ferroptosis leads
  to increased survival of SFs, further promoting inflammation and immunity. SFs synovial
  fibroblasts, SM synovial macrophages.
