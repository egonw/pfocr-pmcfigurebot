caption: 'Study the effect of high-dose E2 exposure on gene expression. Log2FC values
  of the selected genes were determined in response to E2 treatment in the PEO1 (A)
  and A2780 (B) cell lines as well as in the PEO1 cell line in the presence of 10
  nM MPP (C). The total RNA was isolated from the cells at 24 h and 48 h after E2
  treatment. Significance was determined between the âˆ†CT values of the treated and
  non-treated samples. a: p < 0.05; b: p < 0.01; c: p < 0.001; d: p < 0.0001.'
