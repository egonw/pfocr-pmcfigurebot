caption: HP-stimulated HUVEC-Exos promote VSMC calcification. (A) Expression levels
  of OPN and Runx2 in VSMCs were measured by western blot analysis. (B) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR analysis of OPN and Runx2 expression in VSMCs. (C) ALP activity assays were
  performed. (D) Ca content in VSMCs was measured. (E) VSMCs were stained for mineralization
  using Alizarin red S. Scale bar, 100 µm. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 compared
  with the Ctrl group. ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Ca, calcium; Ctrl, control; HP,
  high phosphorus; HUVEC-Exos, exosomes from HUVECs; NP, no phosphorus; OPN, osteopontin;
  Runx2, runt-related transcription factor 2; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell.
article_title: Exosomal STAT1 derived from high phosphorus-stimulated vascular endothelial
  cells induces vascular smooth muscle cell calcification via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway.
