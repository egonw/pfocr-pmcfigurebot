caption: 'KLF14 regulates ITGB1 and affects cervical cancer cell apoptosis. A The
  Western blot results showed that the ITGB1 expression level in the Lv-KLF14 group
  was lower than that in the Lv-control group. B The dual-luciferase reporter assay
  results showed that KLF14 directly targeted ITGB1 and downregulated ITGB1 expression.
  C Six groups were established: Lv-control (ITGB1), Lv-ITGB1, Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-control
  (KLF14), Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-KLF14, Lv-KLF14 + Lv-control (ITGB1) and Lv-KLF14 + Lv-ITGB1.
  [A Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-control (KLF14) and Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-KLF14, KLF14 overexpression lentivirus
  and its negative control lentivirus were transfected into SiHa cells transfected
  with Lv-ITGB1. B Lv-KLF14 + Lv-control (ITGB1) and Lv-KLF14 + Lv-ITGB1, ITGB1 overexpression
  lentivirus and its negative control lentivirus were transfected into SiHa cells
  transfected with Lv-KLF14]. Flow cytometry confirmed that the apoptosis rate of
  SiHa cervical cancer cells in the Lv-ITGB1 group was lower than that in the Lv-control
  (ITGB1) group. The apoptosis rate of SiHa cells in the Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-KLF14 group
  was higher than that in the Lv-ITGB1 + Lv-control (KLF14) group. The apoptosis rate
  of cervical cancer cells in the Lv-KLF14 + Lv-ITGB1 group was lower than that of
  cervical cancer cells in the Lv-KLF14 + Lv-control (ITGB1) group. (*P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001)'
