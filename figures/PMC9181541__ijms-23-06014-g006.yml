caption: Kub3 deletion results in an abnormal FGF signaling pathway. (Aâ€“E) Quantitative
  RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA levels of marker genes for the Wnt, Shh, Bmp, Notch,
  and FGF signaling pathways, respectively. The data are derived from three independent
  experiments and are normalized to the GAPDH (n = 3. * p < 0.05). (F) Protein levels
  of marker proteins for the FGF signaling pathway in E18.5 lungs. Protein lysates
  were subjected to Western blot performed with the indicated antibodies. GAPDH was
  used as a loading control. (G) Immunostaining of Fgf10, p-Erk, and Etv4 in E18.5
  lung sections. (H) Western blot analysis of marker proteins for the FGF signaling
  pathway in HEK293 cells. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
