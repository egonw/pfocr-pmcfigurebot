caption: Volcano graph showing differences in the abundance of metabolic pathways
  of the gut microbiota based on multiple Mann–Whitney tests of LDLR (−/−) mice fed
  a regular diet of food (RCD) with (+C5) or without olivetol supplementation. The
  volcano plot represents changes in the abundance of metabolic pathways between different
  dietary conditions. The Q value reflects a false discovery rate of 5%. The mean
  rank difference values reflect the direction of the changes in the abundance of
  metabolic pathways (values below zero indicate a higher representation of the pathway,
  while values above zero indicate a decreased representation of the pathway in the
  microbiota of mice fed a diet with C5 supplementation). Statistically significant
  values are marked with green or red dots.
