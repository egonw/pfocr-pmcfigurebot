caption: Chrysin induces apoptotic body formation in A375SM and A375P human melanoma
  cancer cells. (A) Cells were seeded for 24 h and then incubated with the indicated
  concentration of chrysin for 24 h. After that, cells were fixed and stained with
  DAPI solution. Cell morphological changes were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope
  (200×). (B) The bar graph represents the average of four fields under a fluorescence
  microscope and the percentage of DAPI-positive cells among all cells. Data are presented
  as the mean and standard deviation for three samples. Significance was determined
  by Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, compared with the control.
