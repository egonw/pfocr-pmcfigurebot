caption: Overexpression of FAM107A promotes prostate cancer cell cycle arrest and
  induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. (A) Detection of the effect of FAM107A
  on the cycle of DU 145 and PC 3 cells using flow cytometry. (B) Western blotting
  to verify changes in cyclin D1 and apoptosis markers Bax, Cleaved caspase-3, and
  Bcl-2. (C) Detection of apoptosis rate of both groups of cells using flow cytometry.
  (D,E) Quantitative analysis of cell cycle changes and changes in apoptosis rates.
  Data are expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation of at least three experiments.
