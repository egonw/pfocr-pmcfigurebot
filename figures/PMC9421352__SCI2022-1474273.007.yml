caption: 'miR-100-5p promotes epidermal stem cell proliferation through MTMR3-mediated
  activation of the PIP3-AKT signaling pathway. (a, b) Human epidermal stem cells
  (EpSCs) transfected with miR-100-5p mimics (miR-100-5p) or negative control miRNA
  (NC); MTMR3 siRNA or control siRNA for 24 h was examined for intracellular levels
  of PIP3 and protein levels of p-AKT, respectively. (c, d) EpSCs cotransfected with
  NC and control vector (Vector), miR-100-5p and Vector, or miR-100-5p and MTMR3 expression
  plasmid (MTMR3) for 24 h were examined for intracellular levels of PIP3 and protein
  levels of p-AKT, respectively. (e) EpSCs transfected with NC or miR-100-5p for 24 h
  were treated with 10 μM LY294002 or control solvent (DMSO) for 2 or 3 days; cell
  proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Data are shown as mean ± SD, n = 3. ∗P
  < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001, compared with cells transfected with (a, b)
  NC, (c, d) NC + Vector, or (e) cells transfected with NC and treated with DMSO;
  #P < 0.05 and ###P < 0.001, compared with cells transfected with (a, b) control
  siRNA, (c, d) miR-100-5p + Vector, or (e) transfected with miR-100-5p and treated
  with DMSO.'
