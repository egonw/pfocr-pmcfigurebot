figure_title: GITRL overexpression induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition and enhances
  the proliferation of hepatic progenitor cells via the ERK1/2 and Akt signalling
  pathways
caption: A The morphology of GITRL-overexpressing hepatic progenitor cells and vector-transfected
  control cells. B 3D-SIM images of GITRL expression in GITRL-overexpressing hepatic
  progenitor cells and the vector-transfected control cells after immunofluorescence
  staining without permeabilization. C TaqMan RT-PCR results showed increased transcription
  of GITRL and α-SMA in the GITRL-overexpressing cells compared to the vector-transfected
  control cells (N = 3). D Immunofluorescence staining without permeabilization and
  flow cytometry showed the expression of GITRL and GITR in the GITRL-overexpressing
  cells. E GSEA based on RNA sequencing data comparing the GITRL-overexpressing cells
  (N = 3) to the vector-transfected control cells (N = 2) showed that overexpression
  of GITRL activated the epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathway. F Top ten pathways
  with significant changes after GITRL overexpression by KEGG analyses based on RNA
  sequencing data. G Overexpression of GITRL increased the Ki-67 positive rate when
  compared to that of the vector-transfected control cells (N = 3). H Overexpression
  of GITRL enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and Akt (Ser473)
  compared to that of the vector-transfected control cells (N = 3).
