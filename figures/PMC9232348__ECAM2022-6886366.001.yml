caption: Curcumin can significantly decrease cell viability of drug-resistant NSCLC
  cells. (a, b) The effect of different concentrations of DDP on cell viability of
  A549, H1299, A549/DDP, and H1299/DDP cells. (c, d) The effect of curcumin on cell
  viability of A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells. Experiment data are presented as the
  mean ± standard deviation (SD), each experiment was conducted 3 times. ∗P < 0.05,
  when compared with the A549/DDP or H1299/DDP group; &P < 0.05, when compared with
  the 0 μg/ml curcumin group. DDP, cisplatin; NSCLC, non-small-cell lung cancer.
