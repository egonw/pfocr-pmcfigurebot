caption: 'Effect of RR-AuNPs on (A) MAPK and (B) nuclear factor (NF)-κB in TNF-α/IFN-γ
  (T + I)-stimulated HaCaT cells. The expression or phosphorylation of the indicated
  proteins was determined in whole-cell lysates by western blotting using the indicated
  antibodies. NC treated with medium alone; T + I, inflammation-induced control treated
  with T + I alone. Crosshatch marks indicate significant differences between NC and
  T + I, and asterisks indicate significant differences between T + I and each group.
  *p < 0.05; ## and **p < 0.01; ### and ***p < 0.001.'
