caption: Phase separation in innate immune and inflammatory responses. During infection,
  the replication and assembly of many viruses occurs in viral factories or viral
  inclusion bodies. These structures condense viral proteins, nucleic acids, and cytokines,
  carry the essential steps of viral replication, and protect the viral genome from
  cellular defenses. (–, , , ) Similar to virus factories, stress granules (SG) are
  also be observed during virus infection. The difference is that the virus factory
  is a liquid-like concentrate that the virus uses to protect itself and stimulates
  the host to synthesize it, while the stress granules are the defense mechanism formed
  by the host in the face of viral infection. (, ) The cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  is an important DNA sensing mechanism in the innate immune system. cGAS contains
  an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain,
  that catalyzes and synthesizes cGAMP. cGAMP then acts as the second messenger to
  bind and activate STING on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon activation,
  STING recruits TBK1 to promote the transcription of type I IFNs and the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines to trigger immune responses. (, –) Viral RNA binds to
  the N protein of SARS-COV-2 to undergo robust phase separation to form biomolecular
  condensates. The N protein and viral RNA droplets provide a space for recruitment
  of TAK1 and IKK complexes. TAK1 was completely co-located with the N protein, while
  IKKβ surrounded the TAK1/N/RNA droplet boundary. Ultimately, it promotes the activation
  of NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in the release of multiple cytokines and inducing
  inflammatory responses. After respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects host cells,
  NF-κB subunit p65 is isolated into inclusion bodies by phase separation, inhibiting
  NF-κB signaling pathway. The epigenetic protein ZMYND8 also forms a fluid compartment
  with p65 to silence the latent superenhancers and inhibit macrophage-mediated inflammation
  (–, , , –).
