figure_title: mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of CAD at S1859 persists beyond T cell
  activation
caption: (A) The de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. The rate-limiting trifunctional
  enzyme CAD is phosphorylated and activated by S6K1, which is in turn phosphorylated
  and activated by mTORC1. The CAD protein catalyzes the first three steps of this
  pathway and is inhibited by the small molecule PALA (shown in red). (B) Western
  blot analysis of CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens of naïve WT mice and stimulated
  with anti-CD3/28 antibodies for indicated time periods with or without rapamycin
  (100 nM). (C) Western blot analysis of CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens of naïve
  WT, Rptor−/− and Rictor−/− mice stimulated with anti-CD3/28 antibodies for indicated
  three hours. (D) Flow cytometric analysis of WT, Rptor−/− and Rictor−/− mice for
  pCAD. CD8+ T cells from WT mice were analyzed as either unstimulated (grey) or stimulated
  using anti-CD3/28 antibodies for three hours with 100 nM rapamycin (black) or without
  rapamycin (red). Rptor−/− (blue) and Rictor−/− (green) CD8+ T cells were also stimulated
  for three hours. (E) Western blot analysis of CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens
  of naïve WT mice and stimulated with anti-CD3/28 antibodies for 36 and 72 hours.
  (F) Western blot analysis of CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens of naïve C57BL/6J
  mice and stimulated with anti-CD3/28 antibodies for 48 hours, then expanded in media
  containing IL-2 or IL-7 + IL-15 for an additional five days. Data in (B) includes
  representative image and densitometry of fold increase in signal relative to actin
  across three experiments. Data in (C) includes representative image and densitometry
  of signal relative to actin across three experiments. Data in (D) included representative
  image and depicts fold change in MFI over naïve CD8+cells across three experiments.
  Data in (E) and (F) include representative image and densitometry of signal ratio
  of phosphoprotein to total protein relative to actin across three experiments. Data
  in (B), (E), and (F) analyzed by two-tailed t test. Data in (C) and (D) analyzed
  by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD test. *P <0.05, ns = not significant.
