caption: A series of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. (A) NAFLD-related
  TFs selected by TRRUST and ChEA3, indicated by yellow circles. The purple circles
  represent the top 50 significant differentially expressed genes in the NAFLD merged
  dataset. The optimal 10 crosstalk genes are indicated by the green circle. (B) Fourteen
  crucial pathways functioning in both NAFLD and DN, indicated by green squares. The
  purple-red circles represent the genes from each pathway both NAFLD-related and
  DN-related. The lilac circles represent the significant differentially expressed
  genes in the NAFLD merged dataset. The green circle represents the significant differentially
  expressed genes in the DN merged dataset. (C) DN-related TFs selected by TRRUST
  and ChEA3, indicated by purple circles. The green circles represent 10 optimal crosstalk
  genes. The genes from each pathway both NAFLD-related and DN-related were indicated
  by yellow circles. The pink circles represent NAFLD-related TFs.
