caption: 'Expression level of the genes in the primary thoracic ligamentum flavum
  cells (TLFCs) at different ossification stages. (A and B) the expression of LGR5,
  Wnt related genes and osteogenic markers was assessed by qRT‐PCR; p < 0.05 vs. IO
  group, #p < 0.05 vs. IMO group; (C) ALP staining of the TLFCs at different ossification
  stages; the scale bar represents 500 μm'

  flavum cells by Wnt signalling pathway.
