caption: Cell cycle and cell proliferation are the most-dysregulated pathways in PLDCs.(A)
  Based on in silico analysis, 16,241 potential mRNA targets were identified of the
  80 miRNAs downregulated in PLDCs. mRNA-seq showed that, out of 12,202 mRNAs expressed
  in PLDCs, 11,321 represent potential targets of reduced miRNAs. (B) In PLDCs, 3,281
  transcripts were upregulated, 4,044 were downregulated, and 3,996 were unchanged
  compared with NHCs. (C) Pathway cluster analysis revealed the most-altered pathways
  in PLDCs. The number of transcripts dysregulated in each pathway is shown in parentheses.
  (D) Pathway cluster analysis of 2,523 transcripts targeted by miR-345 revealed the
  cell cycle, cell proliferation, and cAMP-mediated signalling as the major pathways
  affected in PLDCs. NHC, normal human cholangiocyte; PLDC, polycystic liver disease
  cholangiocyte.
