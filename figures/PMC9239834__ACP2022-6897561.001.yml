caption: UPK3A expression levels in gastric cancer cell lines. (a) The expression
  of UPK3A in cancers was assessed by TCGA database. (b) The expression of UPK3A in
  gastric cancer was assessed by TCGA database. (c) Prognosis value of UPK3A was analyzed
  by Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis. (d) The UPK3A level in GES-1, SNU-216, AGS, and
  HGC-27 cells was measured by qPCR and Western blot assays. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. GES-1
  cells.
