caption: Boron‐mediated multiple defence‐related pathways during CGMMV infection.
  (a) Representation of antiviral defence signalling. (b) Expression patterns of immune
  signal transduction‐ and disease resistance‐associated differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in watermelon fruits. Heatmaps describe the expressions of DEGs associated
  with calmodulin, Ser/Thr protein kinase family, MAPKs, transcription factors, thaumatin
  family, thioredoxin family, NB‐LRR family, ABC transporters, DNA repair pathway,
  E3 ubiquitin‐protein ligases, and other disease resistance genes at 30 and 45 days
  after pollination (DAP). (c) Validations of RNA‐Seq results through reverse transcription‐quantitative
  PCR (RT‐qPCR) (n = 9). P, phosphate‐buffered saline; H, water; B, boron; C, CGMMV.
  (d) Watermelon blood flesh disease symptoms in the fruits from various gene‐silenced
  watermelon plants collected at 45 days postinoculation (dpi). (e, f) Determination
  of CGMMV accumulation in the fruits from various gene‐silenced watermelon plants
  or controls at 45 dpi by northern blot, western blot, and RT‐qPCR analyses. CP,
  coat protein; CBB, Coomassie brilliant blue. (g) RT‐qPCR analysis of virus‐induced
  gene silencing (VIGS)‐induced target gene silencing efficiencies (n = 9). (h) Salicylic
  acid (SA) content in the SABP2‐silenced watermelon fruits or controls (n = 3). Results
  are presented as the mean ± SD. The statistical significance between the treatments
  was determined using one‐way analysis of variance followed by Duncan's multiple
  comparison test (p < 0.05). Other results were analysed using the two‐tailed t test.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Scale bar = 5 cm. Abbreviations of genes and
  compounds are explained in Table .
