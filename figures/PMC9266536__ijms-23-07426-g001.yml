caption: Schematic diagram of fenretinide activity in cancer. Pointed arrows represent
  pathway activation, and blunt arrows represent pathway inhibition. Fenretinide activates
  PKCδ in the mitochondrial signalosome with consequent activation of PDK2, PDHC,
  TCA and increased ROS production. High increase of ROS activates the p38 apoptotic
  pathway with CytC release, caspase-9 activation and induction of apoptosis. Moderate
  increase of ROS activates the JNK autophagy pathway.Fenretinide induces translocation
  of RARβ-Nur77 dimer from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where Nur77 binds Bcl-2 allowing
  their conformational change towards pro-apoptotic structures. Fenretinide inhibition
  of DES1 increases DhCer/Cer ratio and triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress with
  blocking of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and NF-KB signaling pathways, as well as with blocking
  of eIF2 phosphorylation due to PERK. Moreover, fenretinide inhibits mTORC2 and mTORC1
  by structural affinity with mTOR-ATP binding site.
