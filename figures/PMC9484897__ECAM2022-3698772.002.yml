caption: Effect of REA on the migration and invasion of EC cells. (a) Results of Eca109
  and KYSE150 cells scratch assay (scale bar, 100 μm); (b) Eca109 and KYSE150 cells
  migration; (c) Transwell invasion assay of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells (crystal violet
  staining, 400x, Scale bar, 50 μm); (d) number of membrane piercing in Eca109 and
  KYSE150 cells; (e) the expression of E-cadherin, Slug, and N-cadherin in Eca109
  and KYSE150 cells was determined using western blot analysis. The data were expressed
  after being normalized to β-actin. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD. Compared
  with the control group, ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01.
