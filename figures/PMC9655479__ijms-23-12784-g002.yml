caption: The differential expression analysis of the selected polarity-related genes
  (PRGs) with clinical value in different tumor tissues and paracancerous tissues
  of the digestive system from the cancer genome atlas (TGCA) database. (A) Volcano
  plot of 61 PRGs expression change between tumor and matching normal tissues from
  liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) with fold change >1.5 and FDR p < 0.05. CTNNA2
  was separately illustrated. (B) The mRNA expression level of selected polarity-related
  genes across colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), stomach adenocarcinoma
  (STAD), and LIHC datasets. The larger circle, the more statistically significant.
  (C) EMT and cell cycle pathway are the mostly disrupted by the selected polarity
  genes across all cancer types deposited in TCGA. The color in each cell indicates
  that the percentage of altered pathway occurrence in evaluated cancer types. Red
  for activation, blue for inhabitation.
