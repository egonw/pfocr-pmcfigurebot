caption: Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by SsNK-lysin-derived peptides in
  S. salar HKLs. HKLs were pretreated for 2 hours with 10 μM of SB202190 inhibitor
  (p38 inhibitor), U0126 inhibitor (mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/MEK2)
  inhibitor) or SP600125 inhibitor (JNK inhibitor). As a negative control, cells were
  incubated with 0.1% DMSO as a vehicle for 2 hours. Cells were then incubated with
  50 μM of NK1, NK2, NK4, or medium for 12 hours. The IL-1β relative expression was
  analyzed by qRT-PCR. The expression of the mRNA was analyzed as 2−ΔΔCT relative
  quantification. The comparative threshold cycle values were normalized for EF-1α.
  Data were expressed as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments, each in
  triplicate. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Šidák’s multiple comparisons
  test (* p<0.05; ** p<0.01; ***p < 0.001; **** p<0.0001). Šídák method performs simultaneous
  joint pairwise comparisons for all possible pairwise combinations of means.
