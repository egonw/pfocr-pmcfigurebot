figure_title: Discovery of potential therapeutic target of malignant phyllodes tumours
  (MPTs)
caption: 'a Hematoxylin and eosin stained picture of primary tumour “mpt-07” of the
  patient with MPT (top) and MPT PDX tumour “MX-99” (bottom). b Somatic mutations
  in cancer-related genes in primary tumours (mpt-07) and matched PDX tumours (MX-99).
  c Visualisation in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) shows p.N666K somatic mutation
  of PDGFRB in the primary and PDX tumours (top), and the lollipop plot shows the
  p.N666K mutation in the PDGFRB kinase domain (bottom). d PDGFRB mRNA expression
  levels in normal breast tissues, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissues, and MPT
  (Mann–Whitney test). e Heatmap showing the expression patterns of genes involved
  in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in MPT and IDC. Genes with an average FPKM across all
  samples ≥1 were selected among genes in the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway (KEGG ID:
  hsa04151) and mTOR signalling pathway (KEGG ID: hsa04150). f mRNA expression levels
  of IGF1 and IGF2 in MPT and IDC (Mann–Whitney test). g Tumour growth in the “MX-99”
  xenograft model treated by vehicle, imatinib, and PKI-587 (Wilcoxon test). h Western
  blot analysis of downstream signalling pathway molecules in xenograft tumours treated
  with vehicle, imatinib, and PKI-587. i Quantitative analysis of western blot results
  (Mann–Whitney test). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.'
