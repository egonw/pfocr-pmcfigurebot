caption: 'HBx induced aerobic glycolysis via the NF-κBp65/HK2 pathway to reprogram
  glycolytic metabolism in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Glucose uptake a, lactate
  production b, and ATP production c were detected in HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B cells with
  or without transient transfection with NF-κBp65 plasmids. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05 by Student’s t test. d Cell lysates were analysed by Western
  blot using the indicated antibodies. Glucose uptake e, lactate production f, and
  ATP production g were detected in HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B cells transfected with HK2
  siRNA or combined with the NF-κBp65 plasmid. Data are presented as the mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05 compared to the vector cells by one-way ANOVA. h Cell lysates were analysed
  by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. i, j Cell growth of the above cells
  was detected by CCK-8 assays. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. P < 0.05 by repeated-measures
  ANOVA. k Luciferase reporter assay of HK2 promoter activity in HepG2 cells transfected
  with the NF-κBp65 plasmid. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05 by Student’s
  t test. l Luciferase reporter assay of HK2 promoter activity in HepG2 cells transfected
  with HBx plasmid and NF-κBp65 siRNA. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05
  compared to the vector cells and #P < 0.05 compared to the HBx cells by one-way
  ANOVA. m Schematic diagram of the promoter region of HK2 with a putative NF-κBp65
  binding site. n, o ChIP‒qPCR assays and agarose gel were performed to analyse the
  interaction between NF-κBp65 and the HK2 promoter. Data are presented as the mean ± SD.
