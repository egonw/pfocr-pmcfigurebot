caption: Arginine metabolism and methylation in M1-Mɸ versus M2-Mɸ.A, concentrations
  of arginine pathway metabolites in M0-, M1-, and M2-MФs measured by LC-MS. Concentrations
  were calculated by normalizing the signal intensity relative to an internal standard
  of known concentration, 3,3,2-2H-serine. B, arginine pathway showing metabolites
  framed in red or green colors indicating an increase in either M1-MФ or M2-MФ. PMRT,
  protein arginine methyltransferase; ADC, arginine decarboxylase; AGAT, arginine:glycine
  amidinotransferase; ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ASS, argininosuccinate synthase;
  OAT, ornithine aminotransferase; OTC, ornithine transcarbamylase. C, heat map showing
  differential levels of arginine methylation in M0-, M1-, and M2-MФs.
