caption: Uridine inhibited oxidative stress in the primary hepatocytes of Nile tilapia.
  (a) The activity of SOD in the primary hepatocytes (n = 6). (b) The contents of
  MDA in the primary hepatocytes (n = 6). (c) The contents of GSH in the primary hepatocytes
  (n = 6). (d) The protein expression of Nrf2 in the hepatocytes (n = 4). (e) Quantitation
  of Nrf2 levels normalized to GAPDH levels from blots shown in (d) (n = 4). (f) The
  gene expression of Nrf2 signaling pathway in the hepatocytes (n = 6). (g) The cells
  proliferation analyzed by CCK-8 in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell model (n
  = 10). (h) The activity of SOD in the primary hepatocytes (n = 6). (i) The contents
  of MDA in the primary hepatocytes (n = 6). (j) The contents of GSH in the primary
  hepatocytes (n = 6). Statistics were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s adjustment
  and presented as mean ± SEM (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001).
