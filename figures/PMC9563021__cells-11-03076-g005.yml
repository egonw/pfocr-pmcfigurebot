caption: 'Effect of baicalin on the mRNA expression levels of Chop (A), Fas (B), Nos2
  (C), Ptgs2 (D), Stat-1 (E), c-Jun (F), c-Fos (G), and At1α (H) in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
  Values are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Nor, normal
  group incubated with media only; Con, control group treated with 1 µg/mL of LPS
  only; BN10, BN25, and BN50 are 10, 25, and 50 µM of baicalin, respectively; BA,
  baicalein (25 µM). # p < 0.001 vs. Nor; * p < 0.05 vs. Con; ** p < 0.01 vs. Con;
  *** p < 0.001 vs. Con.'
