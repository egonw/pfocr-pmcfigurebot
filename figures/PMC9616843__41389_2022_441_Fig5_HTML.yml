figure_title: DUSP5P1 exerts tumor-promoting function partially depending on the ARHGAP5
caption: 'A, B ARHGAP5 mRNA A and protein expression B were correlated with the DUSP5P1
  expression. Ectopic expression of DUSP5P1 increased the mRNA and protein expression
  of ARHGAP5 in BGC823, MGC803 and GES1 by qRT-PCR and Western blot. C DUSP5P1 expression
  positively correlated with ARHGAP5. D Representative images of ARHGAP5 protein expression
  in primary GC tissues by IHC (left panel). ARHGAP5 expression significantly higher
  in the GC tissue as compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues (right panel). E Successful
  knockdown of ARHGAP5 in AGS and MKN74 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western
  blot. F ARHGAP5 knockdown inhibited cell migration and invasion. G Pro-metastatic
  function of DUSP5P1 is dependent on ARHGAP5. (G1) Knockdown of ARHGAP5 significantly
  blunted the promoting effects of DUSP5P1 on cell migration and invasion. (G2) Effect
  of DUSP5P1 knockdown on migration ability with or without ARHGAP5 overexpression
  was investigated. ARHGAP5 overexpression significantly blunted the inhibiting effects
  of DUSP5P1 knockdown on cell migration. H ARHGAP5 activated MAPK signaling. H1:
  ARHGAP5 activated MAPK signaling as evidenced by SRE luciferase reporter assay (left
  panel); H2: The effectors of MAPK signaling pathway regulated by ARHGAP5 identified
  by MAPK signaling pathway PCR array; H3: Correlation analysis of ARHGAP5 and effector
  genes form TCGA database. I Effect of DUSP5P1 on MAPK pathway with or without ARHGAP5
  knockdown was detected by SRE luciferase reporter assay. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001.'
