caption: Differences in the transcriptome between LN positive and LN negative patients.
  (A) The difference in RNA expression between LN positive and LN negative patients.
  Red, LN positive patient lengthening; blue, LN positive patient shortening; gray,
  no significant change. The horizontal line represents P=0.05. (B) GO enrichment
  analysis of genes upregulated in LN positive patients. The size of dots represents
  the number of genes in the pathway, and colors represent the adjusted P value. (C)
  KEGG enrichment analysis of genes upregulated in LN positive patients. The size
  of dots represents the number of genes in the pathway, and colors represent the
  adjusted P value. LN, lymph node; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes.
