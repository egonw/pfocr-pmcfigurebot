caption: Reductive-oxidative methylation metabolic pathway of arsenic. AsV is first
  reduced to AsIII under the action of glutathione (GSH). AsIII is converted to MMAV
  after catalysis by methyltransferase (AS3MT), at the same time S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) and GSH providing methyl donors. MMAV is converted to MMAIII under the action
  of GSH, and MMAIII is secondary methylated to DMAV under the action of AS3MT, SAM,
  and GSH.
