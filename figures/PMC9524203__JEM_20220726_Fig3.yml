caption: 'DSTYK role in oxidative stress in lung cancer cells. (A) Cropped images
  from the Western blot analysis of KEAP1/NRF2 pathway proteins in LLC and H2009 parental
  and DSTYK-KO cells in cytoplasmic/nuclear fractions. Western blots show representative
  results from three independent experiments. (B) ROS measurements in LLC and H2009
  parental and DSTYK-KO cells in basal conditions. Three experimental replicates were
  performed for each experimental condition. Experimental groups were compared by
  t test: LLC, P = 0.0031; and H2009, P = 0.0011. (C) Seahorse extracellular flux
  analysis shows dynamic representation of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in LLC and
  H2009 cells under stress conditions. Three experimental replicates were performed
  for each experimental condition. (D) Comparison of different phases of mitochondrial
  respiration. Parental or KO LCC and H2009 cells share alteration of maximal respiratory
  and spare respiratory capacity in stress conditions. Experimental groups were compered
  by t test. LLC relative maximal respiration, P = 0.03; relative spare capacity,
  P = 0.01. H2009 relative ATP production, P = 0.002; relative proton leak, P = 0.04;
  relative maximal respiration, P = 0.0008; relative spare capacity, P < 0.0001; relative
  non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, P = 0.03. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***,
  P < 0.001. All images are representative results out of three experimental replicates.
