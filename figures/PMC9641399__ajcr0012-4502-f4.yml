caption: Effect of IVM on the growth of HCT-8 xenograft tumor in vivo. The NOD/SCID
  mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 107 HCT-8 cells. When the tumor reached
  to about 100 mm3, the mice were treated with IVM (2 or 3 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal
  injection daily for 18 days. (A) Tumor volumes from day 0 to day 18. (B and C) The
  weights (B) and images (C) of the tumors at the last day of IVM treatment. Mice
  treated with vehicle served as control. Data in (A and B) were presented as the
  mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05, compared with the vehicle controls.
