caption: (A) Selected osteogenesis-related Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of downregulated
  genes by osteocyte ablation. (B) Heatmap of significantly differentiated genes (fold
  change > 2.0-fold, WT FPKM > 10, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) (n = 2 per group).
  (C) Indicated gene expression analysis of the cortical bones of WT and DTAhet mice
  (n = 3 per group). (D–F) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of osteogenesis-related
  pathways, including Wnt signaling pathway (D), Hedgehog signaling pathway (E), and
  Notch signaling pathway (F). (G, H) Representative image of flow cytometry (G) and
  analysis of proportions of osteoclast progenitors (B220-CD11bloLy-6Chi) (H) of 4-week
  WT and DTAhet mice (n = 3–4 per group). Error bar represents the standard deviation.
