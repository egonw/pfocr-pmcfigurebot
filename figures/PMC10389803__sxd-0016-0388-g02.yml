caption: Global changes in metabolism and epigenome during mouse PGC specification
  and early PGC differentiation from E5.0 to E12.5 are indicated. The shading of the
  bars represents the predicted activation state of each metabolic pathway, with darker
  bars indicating higher activity. The na√Øve and primed stem cells are highlighted
  with green and light green in the embryos, respectively, while PGCs are highlighted
  with red. The red text shows the metabolic pathways or metabolites that affect the
  specification or differentiation of PGCs.
