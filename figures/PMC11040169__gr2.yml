caption: Effect of genistein on the protein levels of estrogen receptors and Erk-PPARγ
  signaling pathway related factors in chicken adipocytes. (A) Immunoblot of ERα,
  ERβ, GPER1, and Tublin β protein; (B) The protein levels of ERα, ERβ, and GPER1;
  (C) Immunoblot of p-Erk, t-Erk, PPARγ, and Tublin β protein; (D) The protein levels
  of p-Erk/t-Erk and PPARγ. Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 3). ** P < 0.01,
  compared with the control group.
article_title: Synergistic effect of genistein and adiponectin reduces fat deposition
  in chicken hepatocytes by activating the ERβ-mediated SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway.
