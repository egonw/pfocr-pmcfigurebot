caption: Main targets of miR-290/294 cluster. The miR-290/295 cluster modulates both
  stemness and differentiation characteristics of mouse ESCs and embryos by regulating
  cell cycle, de novo DNA methylation, apoptosis, and transcription of pluripotent-associated
  transcription factors. The cytoplasmic mature miR-290/295 members maintain pluripotency
  of mESC by accelerating G1 and extending S phase through direct targeting of cell
  cycle inhibitors such as p21, Lats2, Wee1, and Fbxl5, and also repressing S/G2 transition.
  These mature miRNAs also incorporate Prc2, Ezh2 and Suz12 into promoters of bivalent
  differentiation genes. The miR-290/295 cluster together with miR-302/376 promote
  transition from na√Øve to primed pluripotency by enhancing the activity of MEK pathway
  through direct repression of Akt1. These mature miRNAs partially favor pluripotency
  upon differentiation by direct targeting of Dkk-1, a Wnt pathway inhibitor, resulting
  in upregulation of c-Myc. The mature miR-290/295 gene products also modulate DNA
  methylation in the pre-implantation embryos by targeting of Rbl2 and subsequent
  inhibition of Dnmt3b. The miR-290/295 cluster also enhances the reprogramming of
  somatic cells and the quality of mouse iPSCs through post-transcriptional suppression
  of Ash1l expression and consequently downregulation of HOX genes, which in turn
  promote reprogramming through polycomb-mediated gene silencing.
