caption: 'RSV/ω-3 fatty acids combination disrupts PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
  (A) Immunoblot analysis of c-RAF, phospho-c-RAF (p-RAF), PI3K, AKT, phospho-AKT
  (p-AKT), mTOR, phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR) in RGA-treated ARPE-19 cells with increasing
  concentration (0.6, 3, 6, 12 µM) or with vehicle (Co) for 24 h. β-ACTIN was used
  as a loading control. (B) Densitometry quantification of western blotting. Data
  are expressed as the mean fold induction ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  p-values were determined by a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test of treatments vs. control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and # p
  < 0.0001.'
