figure_title: Schematic model of SVV protease 3C-mediated cleavage of pcGAS for immune
  evasion
caption: SVV infection causes mtDNA release in the cytosol to activate cGAS-STING
  pathway. To evade the innate immune response, SVV evolves a strategy that disrupts
  pcGAS-mediated DNA binding, enzymatic activity and interferon signaling by specifically
  cleaving pcGAS within its N-terminal domain by viral protease 3C.

  mitochondria DNA-mediated immune sensing.
