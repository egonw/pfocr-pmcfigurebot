figure_title: Results of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis based on the targets in
  the PPI network
caption: (A) The bubble plot of the top 20 pathway enrichment analysis; (B) targetâ€“pathway
  interaction network suggests the underlying mechanisms of SGXZ decoction for the
  treatment of NAFLD. Blue circle nodes indicate the targets and orange diamonds represent
  the pathways. The gray edges link the interaction between the targets and pathways,
  and the node size is proportional to the degree value.

  for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease based on network pharmacology,
  molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.
