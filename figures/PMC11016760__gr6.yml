caption: Preimplantation embryos showed sex-dimorphic response to O2 concentrations.(A)
  The number of DEGs in 5% O2- and 20% O2- exposed male or female IVF embryos.(B)
  Venn diagram showing the overlap of DEGs between 5% O2- and 20% O2-exposed male
  or female embryos.(C) Dot plot showing the KEGG pathways enriched with DEGs in 5%
  O2- and 20% O2-exposed male or female early blastocysts.(D and E) Heatmap showing
  expression profiles of female early blastocysts specifically enriched GSH metabolism-
  (D) and p53 signaling pathway- (E) related DEGs.(F) Schematic diagram of male early
  blastocysts specifically enriched glycolysis pathway- and pentose phosphate pathway-related
  DEGs.(G) Bar plot showing the activity of glycolysis pathway by GSVA analysis. Error
  bars, means ± SD, **P < 0.01, by two-tailed Student's t-test.(H) Venn diagram showing
  the overlap of male and female early blastocysts commonly enriched OXPHOS-related
  DEGs. The selected DEGs were also shown.(I) Representative images of JC-1 staining
  in 5% O2- and 20% O2- exposed male or female IVF embryos (left panel). Scatter plot
  showing JC-1 aggregate to monomer ratio (right panel). Scale bars, 50 μm; Error
  bars, means ± SD; ***P < 0.001, by Mann-Whitney test.
