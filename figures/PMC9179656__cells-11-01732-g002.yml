caption: 'Three-dimensional models of α-Syn monomers (membrane-bound and unstructured
  in an aqueous solution) and oligomer (PDB ID: 2N0A; frontal and side view). Amino
  acid residues involved in the intermolecular interactions in oligomers, forming
  β-sheet rich core are shown in blue. N-terminal regions of monomers are denoted
  in blue, while C-termini are denoted in red. The monomer structures were predicted
  using AlfaFold2 []. The 3D protein structure was visualised in PyMOL v2 (available
  at: https://pymol.org/2/; accessed on 16 April 2022).'
