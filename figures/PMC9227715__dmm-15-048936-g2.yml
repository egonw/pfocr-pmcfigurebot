caption: 'An EE ameliorates the metabolic effects caused by a high-fat diet and improves
  insulin signaling in the liver. C57BL/6N mice in control housing conditions were
  fed with ND or HFD for 13 weeks and were then separated into control housing or
  EE for an additional 5 or 13 weeks. Mice were fed with the same diet they had before
  they were separated into different housing conditions. Five experimental groups
  were formed: ND control housing (ND control); normal diet EE (ND enriched); HFD
  control housing (HFD control); and two HFD EE (HFD enriched) groups. Two different
  timepoints were used for the HFD enriched groups: HFD enriched 1 M was maintained
  for an additional 5 weeks, and HFD enriched 3 M was maintained for 12 weeks after
  the change in housing conditions together with the other control groups. (A) Experimental
  design. The dotted lines represent when the mice were euthanized: at 18 (for the
  HFD enriched 1 M) or 26 weeks (for the ND control, ND enriched, HFD control and
  HFD enriched 3 M groups). Representative photo of a control housing cage (left)
  and an EE cage (right) (not to scale). (B) Average weekly weight throughout the
  experiment. The dotted vertical line shows when the mice were separated into the
  different housing conditions at week 13 (ND control, n=15; ND enriched, n=14, HFD
  control, n=15; HFD enriched 1 M, n=14; HFD enriched 3 M, n=15). (C) Final weight
  at week 18 for the HFD enriched 1 M group (n=14), or at week 25 for the ND control
  (n=15), ND enriched (n=14), HFD control (n=15) and HFD enriched 3 M groups (n=15).
  One-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference between group means F (4, 68)=40.45,
  P<0.0001. (D) Weekly average of food intake after the mice were separated into different
  housing conditions (ND control, ND enriched, HFD control and HFD enriched 3 M, n=12 weeks;
  HFD enriched 1 M, n=5 weeks). One-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference between
  group means F (4, 44)=22.44, P<0.0001. Mice were fasted for 6 h to measure blood
  glucose levels and to perform a GTT or ITT to determine the effects of the housing
  conditions on glucose metabolism. The measurements were recorded at week 17 for
  the HFD enriched 1 M group or at week 25 for the ND control, ND enriched, HFD control
  and HFD enriched 3 M groups. (E) Fasting blood glucose levels (n=10). One-way ANOVA
  revealed a significant difference between group means F (4, 45)=15.28, P<0.0001.
  (F) Fasting serum insulin levels after 18 (HFD enriched 1 M) or 26 (ND control,
  ND enriched, HFD control and HFD enriched 3 M) experimental weeks (n=3). One-way
  ANOVA did not reveal a significant difference between group means F (4, 10)=3.358,
  P=0.0547. (G) GTT (n=5). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect for interaction
  F(16, 80)=11.79, P<0.0001; time F (4, 80)=219.1, P<0.0001; group F (4, 20)=40.19,
  P<0.0001; and subject F (20, 80)=6.836, P<0.0001. (H) AUC for the GTT. One-way ANOVA
  revealed a significant difference between group means F(4, 20)=41.07, P<0.0001.
  (I) ITT (ND control, n=10; ND enriched, n=10; HFD control, n=9; HFD enriched 1 M,
  n=5; HFD enriched 3 M, n=7). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect for time
  × group F (16, 144)=4.511, P<0.0001; time F (4, 144)=63.93, P<0.0001; group F (4,
  36)=17.64, P<0.0001; and subject F (36, 144)=10.44, P<0.0001. (J) AUC for the ITT.
  One-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference between group means F (4, 36)=14.49,
  P<0.0001. (K) Representative western blot of proteins of the insulin signaling pathway
  in liver. (L,M) Densitometric analysis of protein levels of phosphorylated AKT Ser473
  (p-AKT) (L), and insulin receptor β subunit (IRβ) (M) (n=6). Data are mean±s.e.m.

  comparisons test (G,I); one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey''s multiple comparisons
  test (C-F,H,J); or unpaired t-test (L,M)]. Statistical significance against the
  ND enriched group is not shown on the graphs for clarity. For G and I, only comparisons
