caption: Hepatic depletion of ACLY but not of ACSS2 results in upregulation of enzymes
  in the DNL pathway processed (active) SREBP1c protein levels. Livers from the HFD-fed
  mouse groups were processed for investigation of (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression
  changes between the groups. C, quantification of protein levels between groups.
  (ns, not significant, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.005, ∗∗∗p < 0.0005, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.00005).
  ACLY, ATP-citrate lyase; ACSS2, AcCoA synthase short-chain family member 2; DNL,
  de novo lipogenesis; HFD, high-fat diet; SREBP1c, sterol regulatory element–binding
  protein 1c.

  lipogenesis by hepatocyte-selective ATP-citrate lyase depletion in obese mice.
