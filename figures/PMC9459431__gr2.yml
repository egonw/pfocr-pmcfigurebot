caption: Melatonin ameliorated isoflurane-induced reduction of SIRT1 and Mfn2 and
  ER stress in hippocampus of new born rats. (A) Western blot bands of SIRT1 and Mfn2
  in the hippocampus. (B) Hippocampal SIRT1 expression decreased after isoflurane
  exposure. Administration of melatonin significantly attenuated isoflurane-induced
  decrease in hippocampal SIRT1 expression in neonatal rats (F(3, 20) = 21.830, P
  < 0.001). (C) Hippocampal Mfn2 expression decreased after isoflurane exposure. Administration
  of melatonin significantly attenuated isoflurane-induced decrease in hippocampal
  Mfn2 expression in neonatal rats (F(3, 20) = 122.900, P < 0.001). (D) Western blot
  bands of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling in the hippocampus. (E) Administration
  of melatonin significantly reduced isoflurane induced increase of endoplasmic reticulum
  stress marker protein CHOP expression in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3, 20)
  = 28.890, P < 0.001). (F) Administration of melatonin significantly reduced isoflurane
  induced increase of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker protein PERK expression
  in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3, 20) = 18.690, P < 0.001). (G) Administration
  of melatonin significantly reduced isoflurane induced increase of endoplasmic reticulum
  stress marker protein caspase 12 expression in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3,
  20) = 26.990, P < 0.001). (H) Administration of melatonin significantly reduced
  isoflurane induced increase of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker protein GRP78
  expression in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3, 20) = 26.010, P < 0.001). (I) Administration
  of melatonin significantly reduced isoflurane induced increase of endoplasmic reticulum
  stress marker protein ATF4 expression in hippocampus of neonatal rats (F(3, 20)
  = 32.240, P < 0.001). Data were presented as mean ± SEM (n = 6). ∗denotes p < 0.05,
  ∗∗denotes p < 0.01, ∗∗∗denotes p < 0.001 when comparing the two groups under each
  end of the capped line.
