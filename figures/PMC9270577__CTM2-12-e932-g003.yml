caption: Repeat element distribution and functional analysis of TFBS within lncRNAs.
  (A) Density plot of the LINEs/SINEs within lncRNAs (frequency of repeat elements
  normalised to the length of the LncRNA), where the x‐axis represents the length
  of the lncRNAs. (B) Frequency distribution of the repeat elements across COVID‐19
  subphenotypes. (C) Pathway enrichment analysis of the genes present within ±5 kb
  upstream and downstream of the lncRNAs, having LINES/SINEs within them. The x‐axis
  represents the enrichment score, circle size the number of genes involved in the
  pathway and the colour of the circle the significance of the pathway. (D) TFBS prediction
  within the repeat element regions in lncRNAs, and transcription factor‐mediated
  regulation of genes overlapping with lncRNAs. The arrow represents the transcription
  factor‐mediated upregulation/downregulation of the overlapping genes
