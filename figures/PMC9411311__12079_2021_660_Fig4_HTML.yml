caption: Sequence specific effect of GM on inhibition of TCR signaling. a Coomassie
  brilliant blue staining for equal loading of proteins. b Western blot analysis of
  phosphorylation status of signaling proteins involved in proximal T cell receptor
  signal transduction pathway in T cells incubated with different peptides. When stimulated
  with CD3/CD28 antibody, there was an increase in phosphorylation of signaling molecules
  ( +) compared to unstimulated cells (-). Pre-incubation with CPPs alone, either
  TAT peptide (T) or 8R peptide (8R) did not affect the increase in phosphorylation.
  Pre-incubation of cells with at GM peptide (500 µM) coupled with either CPPs (TGM
  or 8RGM) completely inhibited CD3/CD28-mediated phosphorylation of the signaling
  molecules. Pre-incubation with mutant peptide (MGM) did not affect the CD3/CD28-mediated
  increase in phosphorylation
