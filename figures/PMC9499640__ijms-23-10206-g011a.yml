caption: Networks of immune system process of gene ontology (GO) of DEGs in Tg mice.
  (a) Significant differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq analysis of Tg versus
  WT mice (n = 8 each) were further analyzed by Cytoscape software with ClueGo to
  visualize immune system related molecular level interaction networks that were over-represented
  in Tg mice. The larger the node size, the smaller the GO-terms p value is reflected.
  Involvement of a number of common genes between the nodes are represented by the
  degree of the thickness of the lines. Pointed arrowhead indicates activation/positively
  regulation. Diamond arrowhead indicates regulation. Immune system process of GO-terms
  for each group is labelled in colored bold letters. (b) A pie chart of immune system
  process GO-terms pathway network groups. A total of fourteen functional immune system
  process GO-terms groups were involved more prominently in Tg mice compared to WT
  mice. Significant networks of the immune system (group p value corrected with Bonferroni
  step down) were indicated by asterisk (** for p < 0.01 and * for p < 0.05).
