caption: 'Inferred pecan-PMV interaction pathway using KEGG ortholog terms (A) and
  heat map of DEGs (B). Responsive progression of gene expression under different
  samples infected PMV compared to CK. Heat maps were drawn using the Log2 ratio (transformed
  FPKM value of PMV infection/those of CK). Detailed genes and expressions data were
  provided in , available as  online. CNGC, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel; CPK,
  calcium-dependent protein kinase; CML, calcium-binding protein; MPK3, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 3; WRKY24, WRKY transcription factor 24; RBOH, respiratory burst
  oxidase homolog protein; PR1, pathogenesis-related protein 1; RIN4, RPM1-interacting
  protein 4; RPM1, disease resistance protein RPM1-like; RPS, probable disease resistance
  protein; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; EDS1: enhanced disease susceptibility 1 protein;
  MYB, transcription factor MYB; KCS or CUT, 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase.'
