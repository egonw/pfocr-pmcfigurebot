caption: Calmodulin-dependent ERK activation is required for gemcitabine resistance
  in vitro. (A) PANC-1-GR cells were incubated with a fixed concentration of either
  a DMSO control (1:1,000), an NFAT-inhibiting peptide (25 μM), the CAMK inhibitor
  KN-62 (10 μM), or the calmodulin inhibitor W-7 (10 μM). After 2 h, cells were challenged
  with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine, and cell viability was evaluated
  after 48 h by MTT assay. Error bars represent mean ± SEM. (B and C) PANC-1-GR cells
  were incubated with a DMSO vehicle or 10 μM W-7 followed by 0, 5, or 10 μM gemcitabine,
  and cell death was evaluated after 48 h by Annexin-FITC assay. Error bars represent
  mean ± SEM. (D–F) PANC-1-GR cells were incubated with a DMSO vehicle or 10 μM W-7
  for 24 h, at which time cells were collected and evaluated by single-cell RNA sequencing.
  Populations were visualized via UMAP scatterplot, transcriptionally distinct clusters
  were identified, and each was subjected to enrichment analysis for cell processes
  identified in . (G) Cell clusters were interrogated by GiTools for alterations to
  cell signaling pathways, showing significant down-regulation of MAPK and ERK signaling
  in W-7–treated clusters. (H and I) Individual genes in the ERK and MAPK gene sets,
  respectively. (J) PANC-1-GR cells were incubated with a fixed concentration of either
  a DMSO vehicle (1:1,000) or MEK/ERK inhibitors U0126 (5 μM) or PD-98059 (5 μM).
  After 2 h, cells were challenged with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine,
  and cell viability was evaluated after 48 h by MTT assay. Error bars represent mean
  ± SEM (*P < 0.05). (K) PANC-1-GR cells were incubated with a fixed concentration
  of either a DMSO vehicle or W-7 (10 μM), and ERK activation was evaluated by immunochemistry
  after 24 h. (L) PANC-1 and PANC-1-GR cells were treated as described and ERK pathway
  activation was evaluated by Western blot. (M) Human PDAC tumor tissue or PANC-1-GR
  cells incubated with a DMSO vehicle or W-7 (10 μM) were stained via immunofluorescence
  for calmodulin. (N and O) PANC-1-GR cells were again treated with either a DMSO
  vehicle or W-7, and the interaction between KRAS and CALM was evaluated by immunoprecipitation.
  WCE, whole-cell extract. (P) Following treatment, PANC-1-GR cells were subjected
  to a KRAS activity assay using an IP with a GST-tagged RBD of the RAF protein. Following
  IP, complexes were resolved and visualized by Western blot for KRAS. Control and
  W-7–treated samples were compared with a positive control (GTPγS) and negative control
  (GDP). (Q) Excisional biopsies from two PDAC patients undergoing survival resection
  were cored, sectioned at 250-μm intervals, and cultured ex vivo either in a control
  DMSO vehicle or 10 μM W-7. After 72 h, slice cultures were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded,
  and stained either with H&E, via immunohistochemistry for CALM, or dual-stained
  for CK19 and PCNA.
