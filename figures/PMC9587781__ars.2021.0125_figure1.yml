caption: The complement cascade. The complement cascade can be activated via the classical
  (immune complexes), lectin (ficolins/collectin-K1/MBL), and alternative (spontaneous
  C3 hydrolysis) pathways. The classical and lectin pathways generate C4bC2a C3 convertase
  whereas the alternative pathway forms C3bBb C3 convertase, both of which cleave
  C3 molecules to form C3a and C3b. C3b can interact with factor B (FB), facilitating
  the cleavage of factor B into Ba and Bb by factor D (FD) to continuously cleave
  C3 molecules in a self-amplification loop. C3 convertases form multimeric complexes
  with additional C3b molecules to form C5 convertases, C3b2Bb to cleave C5 to C5a
  and C5b. C5b then binds to C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form C5b-9, the MAC. C3b acts as
  an opsonin that leads to the phagocytosis of invading microbes. The anaphylatoxins
  C3a and C5a are the main effector molecules of the complement cascades and exert
  their effector functions through binding and activation of their G-protein-coupled
  receptors, C3aR and C5aR1, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory and chemoattractant
  signals. MAC, membrane attack complex; MBL, mannose-binding lectin. Color images
  are available online.
