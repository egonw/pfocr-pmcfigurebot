caption: BCL11A promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NB cells. (A,
  B) Western blot of EMT-associated markers expression (epithelial marker E-cadherin,
  mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug) in NB cell lines when BCL11A
  was downregulated. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. control. (C, D) Western
  blot of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt in control and si-BCL11A NB cells. **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,nsP>0.05 vs. control.
