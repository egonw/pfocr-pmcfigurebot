caption: Reaction mechanisms on Ag(111) and Au(111). a) The coupling mechanisms between
  two dehalogenated monomers on Ag(111) and Au(111), comparing the direct formation
  of a pyrrolopyrrole connection with the stepwise formation of the pyrrolopyrrole
  via the ethynylene intermediate. Effective barriers for the different processes
  are shown and the details of the reactions are given in the Supporting Information.
  b) The reaction mechanism on Ag(111) of removing adatoms (S0 to S2) and the concomitant
  ladderization of an ethynylene bridge into a pyrrolopyrrole group (S2 to S3), showing
  local minima (S0‐S3) and transition states (TS1‐TS3) of the pathway and the associated
  energy profile. In both (a) and (b) energies are given in units of eV.
