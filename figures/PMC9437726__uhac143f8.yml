caption: PPI analysis of DEGs. (A) PPI network. The protein interaction relationships
  of targeted DEGs were determined based on the genome-wide PPI network of apple (GDDH13).
  The predicted protein associations were determined from the STRING database, and
  the PPI was built based on experimental, text mining, database, and co-expression
  evidence. The size of the node is the parameter of the connectivity of the network.
  Multiple copies of identical genes are shown as a single node. For example, the
  large green circle at the bottom of the figure represents five sequences predicted
  as the TOR gene in the RNA-seq data, including MD05G1107800, MD00G1031100, MD10G1086500,
  MD10G1112000, and MD15G1045400. They coincided completely in the PPI network. The
  top small green circle represents novel.4829 in the RNA-seq data. (B) Interaction
  analysis between predicted TOR and proteins in the JA pathway. The 618 amino acids
  of the MD05G1107800 N-terminal and 400 amino acids of the MD10G1086500 N-terminal
  were used to construct BD vectors. JMT, JAZ10, and NPR3 were separately cloned into
  AD vectors. The recombined BD and AD vectors were then co-transformed into yeast
  and grew on different media. T, L, H, and A are short for Trp, Leu, His, and Ade.
  The line connecting TOR and NPR3 was colored red after the interaction was confirmed
  in yeast. The blue line connecting TOR and JMT and the blue line connecting TOR
  and JAZ10 were added to the PPI network according to the results in yeast.
