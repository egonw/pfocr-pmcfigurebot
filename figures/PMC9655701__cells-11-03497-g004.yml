caption: Knockdown of Has2os affected the JNK signaling pathway. (A). The JNK signaling
  pathway is inhibited during skeletal muscle differentiation. The protein expression
  levels of p-JNK and JNK were detected by Western blot. D0 represents the C2C12 cells
  in growth medium and D1, D3, and D5 represent cells switched into differentiation
  medium for 1, 3, or 5 days. (B). Relative expression in (A) were calculated. (C).
  Western blot analysis shows the JNK signaling pathway was activated upon Has2os
  knockdown, meanwhile, the p38 and ERK signaling pathways slightly changed. (D–F).
  Relative expression in (C) were calculated. GAPDH was the internal control. (G).
  Relative activity of JNK signaling in C2C12 cells that were transfected with si-Has2os
  or si-NC. The control plasmid was used as the internal control. The results are
  normalized to those of with si-NC. Values were presented as means ± SEM. The statistical
  significance was calculated by t-test; ns, no statistical significance.
