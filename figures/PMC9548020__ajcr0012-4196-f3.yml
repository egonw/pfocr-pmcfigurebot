caption: Cell viability of HNCSCs and Non-HNCSCs subpopulations of primary tumors
  treated after 24 hours and control group (non-treatment cells). Comparison of responses
  to Cetuximab, Paclitaxel, Cetuximab plus Paclitaxel combination and controls regarding
  to untreated cells in (A) and (B) HNCSCs and Non-HNCSCs subpopulations of primary
  tumors; (C) HNCSCs and Non-HNCSCs by CD44/CD117/CD133 and ALDH cell sorting; and
  (D) HNCSCs and Non-HNCSCs by oral cavity, larynx, and pharynx primary site. ***P<0.001
  compared to respective control group; a P<0,001 compared to respective cetuximab
  treatment by two-way ANOVA statistical analysis.
