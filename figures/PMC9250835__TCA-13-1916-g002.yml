caption: Bioinformatic analyses of target genes for miR‐379‐5p. (a) Volcano plot of
  differentially expressed mRNAs in microarray dataset GSE65194. (b) Venn diagram
  of upregulated genes in microarray data GSE65194 with target genes of miR‐379‐5p.
  (c) GO enrichment analysis of 89 target genes. (d) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of 89 target genes. (e) The PPI network of 89 target genes. (f) Hub genes obtained
  by cytoHubba algorithm of Cytoscape. (g) The survival analysis is based on the expression
  of KIF4A in BC patients. (h) The expression levels of KIF4A in normal breast and
  BC tissue of TCGA. (i) The expression levels of KIF4A in cancer tissues and adjacent
  normal tissues from the same patients of TCGA. (j) The expression of KIF4A protein
  at different stages of BC tissues in TCGA (all data are presented as mean ± SD.
  *p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001). (k) The protein expression of KIF4A in the HPA database.
  (l) Enrichment plots of GSEA in BC with the high and low KIF4A expression phenotype
