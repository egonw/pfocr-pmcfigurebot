caption: Lipidomic ontology and pathway analysis of differential abundances from analysis
  of variance (ANOVA). A, Heatmap of enriched lipid ontology terms (LION) across the
  experimental groups and between samples. LION analysis is based on differential
  abundances from 1-way ANOVA. Red indicates enrichment of term within the sample.
  B, Lipid-related gene set analysis revealed enrichment in sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid
  metabolic processes summarizing pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG), Reactome, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. Color of the circle is coded
  by P value, and the radius is coded by the number of interacting genes in the set.
