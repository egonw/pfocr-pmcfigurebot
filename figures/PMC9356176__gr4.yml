caption: 'Pharmacological inhibition of CBS with AOAA attenuates the DS-associated
  overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ameliorate mitochondrial DNA
  damage (mtDNA). (A): Representative pictures of control cells (CC) and dermal fibroblasts
  from individuals with Down syndrome (DSC) labeled with the redox-sensitive probe
  2′,7’ –dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) under basal (untreated) conditions
  and in the presence of AOAA treatment. (B): Quantitative analysis of the DCFDA fluorescent
  signal. (C): Assessment of mitochondrial DNA damage, expressed as a fold change
  to CC after baseline normalization to the corresponding mitochondrial copy number.
  Each bar graph represents the mean ± SEM of n = 8 human euploid control fibroblasts
  and n = 8 DS fibroblasts, as summarized in . Dotted connecting lines in the bar
  graphs indicate the same cell from a specific donor with/without AOAA treatment
  (3 μM, 24 h). *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01 indicate significant differences between DSC
  untreated vs. CC untreated; #p ≤ 0.05 indicates significant differences between
  DSC + AOAA vs. DSC untreated.'
