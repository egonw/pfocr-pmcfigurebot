caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of MA on the
  activation of macrophage induced by LPS. MA activates Nrf2 pathway to increase antioxidant
  genes and proteins, which in turn reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. The
  dashed lines are speculations based on previous research.
