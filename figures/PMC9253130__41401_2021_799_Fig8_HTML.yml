figure_title: FAK overexpression reverses the effects of ADT-OH on cell migration
caption: a B16F10 cells were transfected with pRK5-FAK or pRK5 plasmid for 24 h and
  then treated with NaHS (2 mM) or ADT-OH (6.3 μM) for 24 h. The cell lysates were
  performed by Western blot with indicated antibodies. b The mRNA levels of FAK, E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin and Vimentin in B16F10 cells under different treatment conditions were
  examined by RT-qPCR analysis. c After transfected with pRK5-FAK or pRK5 plasmid,
  B16F10 cells were treated with NaHS (2 mM) or ADT-OH (6.3 μM) for 24 h. Immunofluorescence
  staining for FAK and F-actin was performed and representative images are shown.
  DAPI was used to display the nucleus of cells. d Transwell assay. B16F10 cells were
  transfected with pRK5-FAK or pRK5 plasmid and then exposed to NaHS (2 mM) or ADT-OH
  (6.3 μM). After 24 h, the cells that migrated to the inferior membrane were stained
  and counted in five fields at a magnification of ×100. n = 5, bar = 100 μm. The
  experiments were carried out in triplicate and representative data are shown. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005
