caption: Graphical abstract for summarizing the contents of the article. Under the
  stimulation of hyperthyroidism, extracellular calcium ions flow through L-type calcium
  channel Cav1.3, which promotes the activation of calpain and calcineurin mediated
  by calcium ions, thereby promoting the transcriptome transition toward cardiac hypertrophy
  and myocardial inflammation. At the same time, ROS level increases in cardiomyocytes
  and activates the expression of Bcl-2/Caspase signalling pathway, thereby promoting
  cardiomyocyte injury. NAC can inhibit ROS level then decrease the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes
  to ensure the safety of the heart.
