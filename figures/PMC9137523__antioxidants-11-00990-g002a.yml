caption: Tomentosin exerts antioxidant activity through activation of the nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. (A) 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
  (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of tomentosin. DPPH (0.15 mM) was allowed to
  react with tomentosin and vitamin C. The data are shown as the mean ± SD of triplicates.
  (B) HaCaT cells were transfected with an antioxidant response element- (ARE-) luciferase
  reporter and incubated for 4 h. The cells were then incubated with the indicated
  concentrations of tomentosin for 24 h and subjected to a luciferase reporter assay.
  The data are presented as the mean ± SD of triplicates. TBHQ was introduced as a
  positive control. TBHQ, tert-Butyl hydroquinone. (C–F) HaCaT cells were incubated
  with 1, 5, or 10 μM tomentosin for 24 h. (C) Protein levels of NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase
  1 (NQO1), Nrf2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1) were analyzed by Western blot. β-actin was introduced as the control for
  whole-cell lysates. (D) mRNA levels of HO-1 and NQO1 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the control. The results are shown
  as the mean ± SD of triplicates. ** p < 0.01 vs. untreated group. (E,F) Cells were
  analyzed by Western blotting (E) of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and by immunocytochemistry
  (F) to assess the level of Nrf2 nuclear translocation. α-tubulin and lamin B1 were
  introduced as the controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts, respectively.
  NE, nuclear extracts; CE, cytosolic extracts. Scale bar = 50 μm.
