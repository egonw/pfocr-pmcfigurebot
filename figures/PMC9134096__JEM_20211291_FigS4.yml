caption: 'LysoPS activated the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway in in vitro–polarized Th1
  cells. (A) Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes of LysoPS receptors, TFs,
  and cytokines in CD3+ CD4+ CD25− CD62L− CD44+ effector T cells, CD3+ CD4+ CD25−
  CD44− CD62L+ naive T cells, or CD3+ CD4+ CD25+regulatory T cells from colonic lamina
  propria of C57BL/6J mice. (B) Percentage of IFN-γ–producing cells among CD4+ T cells
  cultured under Th1-polarized conditions with or without 10 µM 18:1 LysoPS in the
  presence or absence of 0.33 µM Fasudil (mean values ± SD from three independent
  experiments). *, P <0.05; **, P < 0.01; ****, P < 0.001. (C) Naive CD4+ T cells
  from mouse spleens were cultured under Th1-polarized conditions for 24 h, after
  which they were stimulated with 10 µM 18:1 LysoPS for 12 h and then used for immunoblotting
  with anti–HIF-1α and β-actin antibodies. Fold-change of HIF-1α protein was quantified
  using ImageJ. (D) Splenic naive CD4+ T cells were cultured under Th1-polarized conditions
  for 24 h, after which 10 µM 18:1 LysoPS was added into the culture with or without
  0.33 µM Fasudil for 48 h. The basal and maximum ECAR were then analyzed in these
  cells. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ****, P < 0.001. Graphs show mean values ± SD
  from at least seven wells. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
  All data were evaluated by one-way ANOVA. Source data are available for this figure:
