caption: 'PID genes and their functional partners from the STRING database. (A) STRING
  Gene Ontology and (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for sets of genes: (I) PID
  genes, (II and III) PID genes and their functional partners (FPs) with a combined
  interaction score â‰¥ 0.9 and 0.4 to 0.89, respectively. The legend panel for gene
  sets includes a built-in Venn diagram showing the overlap between these sets and
  the total number of genes in the sets (indicated in parentheses near each element
  of the Venn diagram). The analysis was performed for genes (and their partners)
  representing similar phenotypes, i.e., belonging to the same subtables from the
  IUIS tables. A list of subtables is provided in . For sets II and III, only the
  terms encountered for the PID genes are indicated. Dotted lines separate enriched
  terms for genes (and their partners) from each of the IUIS categories, which are
  signed using Arabic numerals above the line graphs. See  for more information. (C,D)
  Wordclouds displaying sets of terms, related to enriched biological processes (C)
  and metabolic pathways (D); the higher the frequency, the larger the word in the
  wordcloud. (E,F) A comparison of the proportion of biologically important and tissue-specific
  genes in gene sets under consideration. Because the gene sets overlapped, we excluded
  PID genes from set II and PID and set II genes from set 3. (E) Odds ratios and horizontal
  bars denoting 95% confidence intervals are shown. The experiment-wise p-value threshold
  corresponds to 0.0021 to account for multiple testing (0.05/24 comparisons). (F)
  The number of genes from the considered sets is indicated using a 100% stacked bar
  chart.'
