caption: Crosstalk of septate junctions and cell compartmentation with signaling and
  fate determination in the Drosophila intestine. The septate junction (SJ) and transmembrane
  protein tetraspanin 2A (Tsp2A) plays a critical role in the differentiation of intestinal
  stem cells (ISCs) to adapt the absorptive enterocyte (EC) fate, by promoting SJ
  assembly and modulating the function of the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). The
  presence of a functional Tsp2A in differentiating ISCs promotes the degradation
  of aPKC, which antagonizes the Hippo pathway. This permits Hippo activation that
  inactivates Yki. Loss of Tsp2A, prevents SJ formation, affects the localization
  of adherens junction components and aPKC leads to Yki hyperactivation and overproliferation
  of ISC cells (diagram adapted with modifications from Ref. []).
