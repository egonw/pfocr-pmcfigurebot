caption: CircNDRG1 acted as a sponge for miR-520h in bladder cancer. (A) Venn diagram
  of the intersection among predicted microRNA by Starbase, CircInteractome and CircBank.
  (B) RT-qPCR showed nitroxoline suppressed the expression of miR-520h. (C) RIP experiments
  were carried out using an AGO2 antibody. (D and E) Biotin-labelled circNDRG1 probe
  was used to bind circNDRG1 through streptavidin agarose and miR-520h were sponged
  by circNDRG1. (F) Dual-luciferase reporter assay validated the binding between circNDRG1
  and miR-520h. (G and H) Transwell and wound-healing assay showed miR-520h minic
  promoted the migration of bladder cancer cells, while miR-520h inhibitor inhibited
  the migration. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
