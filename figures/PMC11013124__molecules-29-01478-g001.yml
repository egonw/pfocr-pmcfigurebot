caption: Energy metabolic disorder and inflammation of microglia in AD in response
  to therapy. When exposed to the AD environment, microglia polarizing to pro-inflammatory
  ‘M1’ phenotypes release many inflammatory cytokines. Microglia activate TLRs, which,
  in turn activate the TREM2/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation
  of HIF-1α, GLUT, and PKM2. This results in reduced OXPHOS, leading to the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory factors. Furthermore, the TREM2/AKT/mTOR
  and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways directly activate NLRP3, promoting inflammatory
  gene expression and further enhancing glycolysis. The drugs indicated in yellow
  text boxes act through target genes (in red) to induce anti-inflammatory responses
  and regulate microglial polarization and energy metabolic disorder, ultimately aiming
  to alleviate or treat AD.
