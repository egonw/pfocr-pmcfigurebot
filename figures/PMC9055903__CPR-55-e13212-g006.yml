caption: Histopathological observation using haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining
  and Masson staining of mice (scale bar = 200 μm) (A). Thickness of dermis, collagen
  ratio average fluorescence intensity score of VEGF and positive rate of p‐P65 (B).
  Immunofluorescence analysis of VEGF (C) and p‐P65 (D) of mice (scale bar = 200 μm
  for VEGF, scale bar = 25 μm for p‐P65). Data expressed as mean ± SD. Different symbols
  (a, ab, b, bc, c, cd and d) indicate significant difference among groups (Fisher's
  least significant difference, p < 0.05), and the values decrease with the order
  from a to d. We repeated the experiments three times to ensure the accuracy of the
  experiments
