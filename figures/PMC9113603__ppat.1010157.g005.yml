figure_title: Characterization of FoQDE2-dependent milRNA (milR-87) in F. oxysporum
  f. sp. cubense (Foc)
caption: (A) Predicted secondary structure of milR-87 precursor in Foc. (B) MilR-87
  expression in different milRNA biosynthetic pathway gene deletion mutants (ΔFoQDE2,
  ΔFoDCL1, and ΔFoDCL2) by qRT-PCR. Error bars indicate S.D. (n = 3). Different letters
  indicate significant difference at the level of α = 0.01. (C) Expression patterns
  of milR-87 at 0, 24, 48, and 96 hours post inoculation. Total RNAs were extracted
  from the host banana roots inoculated with Foc at the different time point (0–96
  h). Relative expression levels of milR-87 were calculated by 2-ΔΔCt method using
  snRNA (U4) as internal control. Error bars indicate S. D. (n = 3). Different letters
  indicate significant difference at the level of α = 0.01. (D) Mycelial sensitivity
  to H2O2. Mycelial growth of the WT strain XJZ2, the ΔmilR-87 mutant (ΔmilR-87-3)
  and milR-87 over-expression strain OEmilR-87-1 were measured at MM with 0 and 3
  mM H2O2. (E) Cellophane penetration assay comparing the invasive growth of the XJZ2,
  ΔmilR-87 mutant and OEmilR-87 strain. Conidia suspensions (100 μl per strain) with
  same concentration of 1×105 spores/ml were put on cellophane-covered PDA plates
  and incubated at 28°C for 4 days (Before, before cellophane removed), then the cellophane
  sheets were removed, and samples were incubated for an additional 3 days (After,
  after cellophane removed) and the colony size indicated mycelial growth were photographed.
  (F) Invasive growth on tomato fruits. (G) Symptoms of pathogenicity on the corm
  of the host banana seedling. (H) Disease severity analyzed by diseased plantlet
  number of different disease grade.
