caption: 'Overview of the immune-based therapeutic approaches under investigation.
  Starting from the top right and going clockwise: ADC are monoclonal antibodies against
  a specific tumor antigen, linked to a drug/toxin which is internalized in the target
  cell, causing its death. Bispecific antibodies have two targets, one specific for
  the tumor cell and the other for T cells, and function as T-cell engagers. Checkpoint
  inhibitors enhance anti-leukemic immune responses by the inhibition of the suppressive
  effect of checkpoint proteins. Dendritic cell-based therapies consist of vaccination
  strategies either with peptides or directly with DCs loaded with tumor antigens
  which are then presented on their surface to both T and NK cells. A macrophage-based
  therapy is represented by magrolimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody that interferes
  with the suppressive signals for macrophages, working similarly to checkpoint inhibitors.
  Finally, there are cellular therapies with adoptive NK cell infusions or CAR-T cells.
  Chimeric antigen receptors are surface molecules with an antigen-recognition domain
  linked to signaling regions of the T-cell receptor pathway, capable of T-cell activation.'
