caption: SADS-CoV nsp5 interferes with the innate immune response by directly cleaving
  DCP1A. SADS-CoV nsp5 antagonizes the type I interferon signaling pathway; the schematic
  was drawn using the Biorender website (https://www.biorender.com). SADS-CoV infects
  swine cells and releases its genome into the cytoplasm to produce nsp5 protein,
  which binds to DCP1A and cleaves it, inhibiting the activation of downstream molecules
  IRF3, NF-κB, STAT1, and STAT2, thereby reducing the production of type I IFN and
  inflammatory cytokines in the cells.
