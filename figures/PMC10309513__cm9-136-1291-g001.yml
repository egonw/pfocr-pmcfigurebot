caption: 'The potential binding mechanism of TREM2 and ApoE. The main hinge region
  of ApoE (shown in hydrophobic surface) potentially binds to the hydrophobic surface
  (brown color) of TREM2 extracellular domain (shown in hydrophobicity surface). The
  predicted structural models of ApoE and TREM2 were downloaded from the AlphaFold
  Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)[,] and visualized with
  the Discovery Studio Visualizer (BIOVIA, San Diego, CA, USA). Two dotted lines delineate
  the plasma membrane. Arrows indicate potential hydrophobic interactions between
  two proteins. ApoE: Apolipoprotein E; TREM2: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
  cells 2.'
