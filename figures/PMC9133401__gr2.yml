caption: Accelerated abiraterone metabolism facilitates drug clearance in patients(A)
  Schema of the steroidal metabolic pathway for abiraterone.(B) Decline in plasma
  abiraterone concentration observed in 6 of 11 patients with acquired resistance
  to abiraterone. Day 0 indicates the baseline PSAs before abiraterone treatment.
  Plasma samples were collected approximately 3 h after abiraterone administration.
  Abi, abiraterone.(C) Plasma concentration of abiraterone and its metabolites before
  and after abiraterone resistance in the 6 patients. The mean abiraterone metabolite
  quantity in each patient during the response period (decreasing PSAs) and progression
  period (increasing PSAs) was calculated and compared.(D) Relative percentage of
  abiraterone and its metabolites before and after abiraterone resistance. 5α-Abis,
  5α-Abi, and its downstream metabolites; 5β-Abis, 5β-Abi, and its downstream metabolites.(E)
  Western-blot analysis of 3βHSD1 expression in abiraterone- or ethanol-treated Huh7
  cells. Huh7 cells were treated with 1 μM abiraterone (Huh7-Abi) or ethanol (Huh7-Ctr)
  for more than 2 weeks before the detection of 3βHSD1.(F and G) DHEA (a mixture of
  10 nM DHEA and ∼20 nM [3H]-DHEA) and abiraterone (100 nM) metabolism in Huh7-Abi
  and Huh7-Ctr cells. AD, androstenedione.(H) Plasma abiraterone and PSA alteration
  in patients receiving abiraterone plus PPI. The red arrows indicate the time point
  of PPI administration. PPI, proton-pump inhibitor.Experiments were performed at
  least three times independently. Student’s t test. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01.See also  and
