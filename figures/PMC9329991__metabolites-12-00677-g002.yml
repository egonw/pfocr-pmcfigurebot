caption: The metabolite set enrichment analysis of our metabolites with PLS-DA scores
  higher than 1 and p-values < 0.05 after the analysis with MetaboAnalyst. Metabolic
  pathways whose name is indicated are significant (p-value lower than 0.05 after
  the adjustment using Holm-Bonferroni method and False Discovery Rate) and have a
  pathway impact value calculated from pathway topology analysis over 0. The pathways
  are represented as circles. The circle color indicates the significance level from
  highest (red) to lowest (white) in the enrichment analysis. The circle size is proportional
  to the impact value of each road from the topology analysis.
