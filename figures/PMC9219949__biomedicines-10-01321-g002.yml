caption: Genomic landscape of oligometastatic prostate cancer from targeted serum
  cfDNA sequencing. Oncoprint shows genomic alterations identified in cfDNA of patients
  with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Genes are grouped by pathway (37 genes shown).
  Mutational frequency for each gene in the targeted panel is provided on the right.
