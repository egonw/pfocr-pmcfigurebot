caption: TLR4 modulated HO-1 expression. (A) Western blot analysis of HO-1 expression
  in myeloma cell lines after LPS treatment. β-actin protein was used as total protein
  loading reference. (B) Immunofluorescence of Nrf2 (green) nuclear translocation
  after LPS treatment in myeloma cell lines. (C) Western blot analysis of HO-1 expression
  in myeloma cell lines 24 h after drug treatments. GAPDH protein was used as total
  protein loading reference. For Western blot analysis, the optical density of the
  bands was measured using Scion Image software. Data are expressed as mean MFI ±
  SEM of n ≥ 4 biological replicates; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001.
