caption: mpact of relaxin 2 (RLXH2) on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) formation. A. Induction of HIF-1Î± expression after hypoxia
  treatment for 12 and 24 hours. B. RLXH2 significantly decreased LDH release from
  the NCI-N87 cells in the hypoxia (H) group compared to the control (C) group (P<0.05).
  A P<0.01 was obtained from the hypoxia plus RLXH2 treatment group (H+R) compared
  to the H group. C. RLXH2 significantly decreased ROS production in the NCI-N87 cells
  in the H group compared to the control group (**; P<0.01) and in the H+R group compared
  to the H group (*; P<0.05). The results are the average of the three independent
  experiments.
