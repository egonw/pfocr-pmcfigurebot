caption: 'Expression of CXXC5, an inhibitor of the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, in human
  adipose tissues of patients with obesity‐induced diabetes. (A) Hierarchical clustering
  and heat‐map of RNA‐seq data in visceral adipose tissues from women with obesity‐induced
  diabetes (n = 5 for all groups). The colour scale shows Z‐score fragments per kilobase
  of transcript per million mapped reads representing the mRNA levels of each gene
  in the blue (low expression) to red (high expression) coloured scheme. (B) Gene
  set enrichment analysis of microarray transcriptome data from BMI‐matched patients
  with diabetes for Wnt/β‐catenin signalling‐activated gene signature. Black columns
  indicate 83 enriched genes in visceral adipose tissues of subjects with normal glucose
  tolerance or diabetes, involving the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway (n = 17 for
  all groups). NES, normalized enrichment score; ES, enrichment score; FDR, false
  discovery rate. (C–F) Expression levels of CXXC5 in visceral adipose tissues from
  lean and obese subjects (GEO: GSE16415, GSE15773, GSE27951, GSE2508) (C), in visceral
  adipose tissues from BMI‐matched obese patients suffering from insulin sensitivity
  and resistance (n = 5 per group) (D), in subcutaneous adipose tissues from subjects
  with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM (n = 4
  per group) (E), in subcutaneous adipose tissues from lean and obese subjects (n = 10
  per group) (F). Expression levels of mRNA were normalized by non‐diabetes (C), insulin
  sensitive (D), NGT (E), lean group (F). (G–I) Visceral adipose tissues from human
  subjects that were lean, obese, diabetic and obese‐diabetic (n = 4 per group). Representative
  IHC images of CXXC5 and β‐catenin in visceral adipose tissue and quantitative analyses
  of IHC staining for CXXC5 and β‐catenin (G: upper panel). The quantitative mean
  intensity value of IHC staining of CXXC5 and β‐catenin was performed (G: lower panel),
  correlation of CXXC5 expression (H) and β‐catenin expression (I) with BMI. (J, K)
  Cxxc5+/+ mice were fed HFD or NCD for 8 weeks (n = 6 per group). Relative Cxxc5
  mRNA expression in epiWAT, scWAT, liver, pancreas, kidney, muscle and heart tissues
  was normalized by NCD‐fed mice group (J) and β‐catenin and Cxxc5 expression in epiWAT,
  scWAT and liver tissues (n = 3 per group) (K). Scale bars = 100 μm. All data are
  presented as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 determined by Student''s t‐test.
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 determined by Tukey''s post hoc test'
