caption: Correlation analysis of ANKRD29 expression on immune cell infiltration and
  immunotherapy in NSCLC. A-B Three immune-related scores (ESTIMATE score, stromal
  score and immune score) (A) and immune cell enrichment scores (B) showed that ANKRD29
  expression was positively correlated with the level of immune cell infiltration
  levels. C-E Data obtained from KM plotter website showed that patients with low
  expression of ANKRD29 indicated promising responses to anti-PD1, anti-CTLA-4 and
  PD-L1/Atezolizumab therapy (D-E), in line with the increased expression of ANKRD29
  in ICB responders analyzed by ROC Plotter database (C). F-I Overexpression of ANKRD29
  in cancerous cells enhanced the ability of Jurkat to kill SPC-A1 and H1975 cells.
  Representative crystal violet staining images of SPC-A1 and H1975 cells after co-culture
  with Jurkat cells (F, H). (G, I) Quantification data for (F, H), respectively. J
  Correlation analysis between ANKRD29 expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration
  levels in NSCLC datasets from TIDE website. Bars are the mean value ± SD. ns = no
  significant. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001
