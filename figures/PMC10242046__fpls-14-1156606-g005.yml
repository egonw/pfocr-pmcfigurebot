caption: Phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling pathway showing co-expressed genes, proteins
  and metabolites in drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive (DS) chickpea genotypes
  under control (C) and drought (D) conditions. Co-expressed genes, proteins and metabolites
  are shown by orange, green and blue colored boxes, respectively. The up-regulated
  genes, proteins and metabolites are marked (*). PP-IPs- Diphosphoinositol phosphates;
  PI- Phosphatidylinositol; PIP, Phosphatidylinositol phosphate; IP, Inositol phosphate.
  Down-regulated genes, proteins and metabolites were not reported in this pathway.

  in chickpea via integrated multi-omics analysis.
