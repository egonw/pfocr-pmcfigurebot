caption: 'Intervention effects of SAG on LPS-induced preeclamptic features. (a) Schematic
  diagram of the animal experimental design. (b) Effects of SAG and LPS on maternal
  body weight gain. ΔMaternal body weight: the increased body weight referring to
  GD0 as baseline. (c) and (d) SBP of GD13 (c) and GD19 (d) in different groups of
  rats. (e) and (f) Proteinuria of GD13 (e) and GD19 (f) in different groups of rats.
  (g) and (h) Creatinine of GD13 (g) and GD19 (h) in different groups of rats. (i)–(k)
  Fetal development in each group. Fetal weight (i) and fetal length (j) in different
  groups. (l)–(n) Placental size in each group. Placental diameters (l) and placental
  weight (m) in different groups. (o) HE staining of placenta tissues in different
  groups of rats. (p) HE staining of liver tissues in different groups of rats. (q)
  HE staining of kidney tissues in different groups of rats. Scale bar: 200 μm. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P <
  0.0001 by Student''s t-test. SD: Standard deviation.'
