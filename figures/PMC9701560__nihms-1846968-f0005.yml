caption: The left panel shows individual tracts involved in the white matter (WM)
  composite, with their corresponding weights in descending order for the PCA. The
  right panel shows the relationship between the WM Composite and estimate years to
  onset (EYO) for non-carriers (NC) (green) and MC (blue). 95% confidence were added
  for each group. For the fig. PCC = Posterior Corpus Callosum; ACC = Anterior Corpus
  Callosum; F Maj = Forceps Major; Cing = Cingulum; F Min = Forceps Minor; ILF = Inferior
  Longitudinal Fasciculus; FOF = Fronto occipital fasciculus; FAT = Frontal Aslant
  Tract; PP = Perforant Pathway; SLF = Superior Longitudinal Fasiculus; UF = Uncinate
  Fasciculus; CS = Corticospinal Tract. (For interpretation of the references to colour
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
