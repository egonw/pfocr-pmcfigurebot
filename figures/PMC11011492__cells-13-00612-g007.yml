caption: 'Expression of NLRP3 in gal-3+/Iba-1+ cells in the optic nerve of mice with
  EAE. Frozen cross-sections from naïve mice (A–D) and EAE mice at peak disease (E–L)
  were triple-stained with anti-Iba-1 antibody ((A,E,I), blue), anti-gal-3 antibody
  ((B,F,J), green), and NLRP3 (marker for inflammasomes; (C,G,K), red). Merged images
  are shown (D,H,L,M). High-magnification images ((H), inset) are also shown (I–L).
  (M) High-magnification image of the inset in (L). Arrowheads show gal-3+/Iba-1+/NLRP3+
  cells in the optic nerve of EAE mice. Representative data are shown. Quantitative
  analysis of the number of gal-3+/Iba-1+/NLRP3+ cells in the optic nerve (N) and
  the ratio of gal-3+/Iba-1+/NLRP3+ cells to gal-3+/Iba-1+ cells in the optic nerve
  (O). Six mice per group were examined. Scale bars: (A–D): 100 μm; (E–H): 50 µm;
  (I–M): 25 µm; (L): 12.5 µm ** p < 0.01.'
