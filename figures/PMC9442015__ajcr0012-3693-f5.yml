caption: Effect of shKu80#2 and RN-1 on the tumorigenic ability of HCT116 cells in
  tumorigenic assays. A. The general picture of xenograft tumor from executed nude
  mice; B. The volume of xenograft tumor in shKu80#2 group and shKu80#2 + RN-1 group
  was significantly small than that in the control group, and the volume of xenograft
  tumor in shKu80#2 + RN-1 group was higher than that in shKu80#. There were also
  statistical differences between the two groups; C. The statistically significant
  difference in weight. D. Immunohistochemical detection of Ku80 and foxf2 protein
  expressions in nude mice xenografts in the control group, shKu80#2 group, shKu80#2
  + RN-1 group revealed that FOXF2 protein increased. E. The Ku80 and foxf2 protein
  expression in transplanted tumors were was detected by Western blot; the shKu80#2
  + RN-1 group found that FOXF2 protein was significantly restored. F. FOXF2 gene
  promoter region 1-2000 bp base sequence.
article_title: LSD1 regulates the FOXF2-mediated Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway by
  interacting with Ku80 to promote colon cancer progression.
