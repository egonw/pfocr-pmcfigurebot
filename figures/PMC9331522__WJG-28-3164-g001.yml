caption: 'The effects of blocking programmed cell death ligand. A: Expression of programmed
  cell death 1 (PD-1) protein; B: Statistical chart showing the differences in PD-1
  protein expression; C: Statistical map showing the differences in PD-1 mRNA expression;
  D: Western blot showing forkhead box protein 3 protein (Foxp3) expression; E: Statistical
  chart showing the differences in Foxp3 expression; F: Statistical map showing the
  differences in Foxp3 mRNA levels. Data are presented as mean Â± SD, and comparisons
  between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance
  was set as P < 0.05. PD-1: Programmed cell death 1; PD-L1: Programmed cell death
  ligand; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DSS: Dextran sulfate sodium;
  B. infantis: Bifidobacterium infantis; Foxp3: Forkhead box protein 3.'
