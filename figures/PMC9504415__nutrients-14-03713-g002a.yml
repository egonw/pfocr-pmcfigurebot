caption: Effect of pinostrobin on the protein levels of tyrosinase, TRP 1, TRP 2,
  and MITF in B16F10 cells. Cells were treated with pinostrobin at various concentrations
  for 24 h. (a) Tyrosinase, TRP 1, TRP 2, and MITF, were analyzed by Western blotting.
  (b–e) Blots were quantified using ImageJ software. β-actin is used as a loading
  control for quantitative Western blotting. The untreated cells were regarded as
  100%. Values are expressed represent as the mean±SD of three independent experiments.
  *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01 and * p < 0.05 compared with control group. NS; not significant.
