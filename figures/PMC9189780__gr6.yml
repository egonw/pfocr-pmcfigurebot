caption: 'The effect of DNTTIP1 on NPC metastasis depends on DUSP2. (a, c) Migration
  and invasion abilities were determined using the indicated stable cells. Representative
  data of three independent experiments. Data are represented as the mean ± SD. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns, no significance using Student''s t-test.
  (b, d) The indicated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting in the indicated
  stable cells. Western Blot bands were derived from three separate experiments but
  only one representative loading control is shown. (e-g) The indicated cells were
  injected into the tail vein of BALB/c nude mice to construct a lung metastasis model
  (n=8 per group). General views (left, scale bar: 5mm) and H&E staining of lung tissues
  of the mouse models with the indicated cells (middle, scale bar: 500μm; right, scale
  bar: 100μm). The red arrows indicate macroscopic pulmonary nodules (e). Lung weight
  (f), and quantification of macroscopic metastatic nodules (g). Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD. *** p < 0.001, ns, no significance using Student''s t-test.'
