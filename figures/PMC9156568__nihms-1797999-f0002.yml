caption: (a) The global nature of whole-brain harmonic waves precludes the identification
  of local propagation patterns that are presented within the associated subnetwork.
  Since we derive the region-adaptive harmonic wavelets within the associated subnetwork
  centered at each node (b), our harmonic wavelets (c-d) depict the local network
  oscillation, which allows us to capture the spatial-spectrum harmonic patterns in
  brain network inference.
