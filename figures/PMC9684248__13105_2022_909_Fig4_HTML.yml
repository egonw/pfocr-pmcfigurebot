caption: 'Pyroptosis in COPD. CS is the predominant risk factor for COPD. CS triggers
  pyroptosis of BECs by activating the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway. Meanwhile,
  CS induces ERS to trigger pyroptosis of BECs via mediating the generation of sufficient
  ROS. The initiation of CS-induced ERS results in the activation of PERK, which sequentially
  upregulates TXNIP by activating the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway. Increased TXNIP contributes
  to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Consequently, pyroptosis occurs. Additionally,
  CS induces caspase-4/11-induced pyroptosis in BECs and accelerates airway remodeling.
  Note: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CS, cigarette smoke; BECs, bronchial
  epithelial cells; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; PERK, protein kinase R-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase; TXNIP, thioredoxin interacting protein; eIF2α, eukaryotic
  translation-initiation factor 2α; CHOP, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous
  protein'
