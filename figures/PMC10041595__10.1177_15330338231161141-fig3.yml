caption: 'NRF1 inhibits anoikis through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. (a-b):
  The number and size of spheres were analyzed in oligomycin A treated breast cancer
  cells (M10A). Three view fields were selected to count the number of cells and data
  was presented as mean ± SD, n = 3.（c-d）The number and size of spheres were analyzed
