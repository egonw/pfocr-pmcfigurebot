caption: Gene expression profiling reveals alterations in cell cycle-related genes
  upon silencing MTHFD1L expression. A. Silencing MTHFD1L expression using short interfering
  RNA (siRNA) decreased protein expression in the human prostate cancer PC-3 and C4-2
  cell lines. The cells were transfected with control or MTHFD1L siRNAs (siMTHFD1L),
  and MTHFD1L protein expression in cells was examined via western blotting. B. Venn
  diagram analysis shows commonly significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes
  upon MTHFD1L knockdown in PC-3 and C4-2 cells, displayed as the number of genes.
  C. WikiPathway analysis of 57 common SDE genes expressed in both PC-3 and C4-2 cells.
  D. Pearson correlation between fold changes in gene expression of cell cycle-related
  pathway genes measured by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR in PC-3 and C4-2 cells. E. Matched
  DNA methylation and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were plotted
  to depict the correlation between MTHFD1L expression and the methylation status
  of the cell cycle-related genes.
