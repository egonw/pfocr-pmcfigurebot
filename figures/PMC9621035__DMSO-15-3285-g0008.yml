caption: 'FST overexpression inhibited lipid synthesis and Akt/mTOR pathway in HFD
  mice. (A and B) The protein expression and analysis results of ACC1, FASN, SREBP1,
  ChREBP, Akt, Akt-Thr308, Akt-Ser473, p-mTOR, and mTOR in the control (treated with
  an AAV vector encoding GFP) and FST-overexpressing (treated with an AAV vector encoding
  FST288 and FST315) HFD mice. β-actin was used as a loading control. (C and D) GTT
  and ITT results in the control and FST-overexpressing HFD mice. (E and F) AUC for
  GTT and ITT. (G) Immunohistochemical staining of hepatic FST in the control and
  FST-overexpressing HFD mice (400×, scale bar: 50 µm).'
