caption: Effects of RSV on ZEA-induced oxidative stress in TM4 cells. TM4 cells were
  seeded into 60 mm plates and exposed to ZEA (20 μmol·L−1) for 24 h after pretreatment
  with RSV (2.5 μmol·L−1) for 3 h. (A) Intracellular ROS levels of TM4 cells. Cells
  were incubated with 10 μmol·L−1 DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The ROS
  levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. (B) Contents of MDA in TM4 cells. (C) Activity
  of CAT in TM4 cells. (D) Contents of GSH in TM4 cells. Different letters (a, b,
  c) represent a significant difference (p < 0.05 calculated by ANOVA for each group),
  while the same letters indicate no significant difference between groups.
