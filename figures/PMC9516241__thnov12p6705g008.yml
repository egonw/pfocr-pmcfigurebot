caption: 'Crosstalk between Müller cells and photoreceptors involved Jak/STAT3 signalling
  pathway. (A) IPA of top 10 changed canonical pathways in MAPK inhibition human retinal
  explants compared with control human retinal explants after 24 h culture. Blue bars:
  negative z-score; red bars: positive z-score. n = 4. (B) Summary results of western
  blot of pSTAT3 in DMSO or PD98059 treated human retinal explants after 24 h culture
  (pSTAT3 is normalised by totalSTAT3). Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. n = 5. (C)
  Western blot image of pSTAT3 and totalSTAT3 in DMSO or PD98059 treated human retinal
  explants after 24 h culture. n = 5. (D) Summary results of western blot of IRBP
  in DMSO or 5,15-DPP (STAT3 inhibitor) treated human retinal explants after 24 h
  culture (IRBP is normalised by Tubulin). Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. n = 6.
  (E) Western blot image of IRBP and Tubulin in DMSO or 5,15-DPP treated human retinal
  explants after 24 h culture. IRBP: interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein.
  STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. pSTAT3: phosphorylation
  of STAT3. IL-1 beta: interleukin-1 beta. DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide. RNA: ribonucleic
  acid. IPA: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. 5,15-DPP: 5,15-Diphenylporphyrin.'
