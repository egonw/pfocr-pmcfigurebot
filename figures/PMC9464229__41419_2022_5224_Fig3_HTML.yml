figure_title: P130cas interacts with YAP and promotes its stabilization, thus inducing
  radioresistance
caption: A GSEA analysis was performed to explore the signaling pathway positively
  correlated with high P130cas expression in NSCLC. B Cytosolic and nuclear proteins
  were extracted respectively to check YAP expression in the A549-NC and -P130cas
  clones, and H1299-NC and –shP130cas clones, α-tubulin or LaminB1 were used as the
  cytosolic or nuclear protein internal control, respectively. In the H1299-NC and
  –shP130cas clones with or without betamethasone, immunofluorescence staining was
  used to evaluate the subcellular localization of YAP (C, scale bar = 10 μm), western
  blot assay was used to detect the phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP (D), qPCR assay
  was used to investigate the alteration of the target genes of YAP (E), luciferase
  reporter assay was used to identify binding activity between YAP and TEAD4 promoter
  (F). After being treated with CHX at indicated time point, the expression of YAP
  was evaluated by western blotting in the A549-NC and -P130cas clones (G). The co-IP
  assay was used to confirm the interaction between P130cas and YAP (H, I). Immunofluorescence
  assay revealed the co-localization of endogenous P130cas and YAP in A549 cells,
  colocation coefficient was quantified by Fiji software (J, scale bar = 10 μm). In
  the A549-NC and -P130cas clones irradiated by 5 Gy X-ray, after incorporation with
  YAP-siRNA or Verteporfin, western blotting (K, L) and immunofluorescence (M) were
  used to observe the expression of YAP and γ-H2AX, as well as the number of γ-H2AX
  foci (scale bar = 10 μm). Mice were subjected to radiation (8 Gy) on days 10, 11,
  to 12 after tumor cell inoculation, and verteporfin (100 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally
  every two days from day 10 to day 18 (n = 8). Mice were euthanatized on day 20 and
  analyzed for tumor size (N). Representative explanted tumor growth curve of mice
  treated as indicated (O, n = 8 per group). Each experiment was quantified as average ± SD
  of three independent experiments (t-test, two-sided, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
  For Western blot experiments, the samples derive from the same experiment and the
  gels/blots were processed in parallel.
