caption: Nanoparticles proposed for immunotherapy. Some nanoparticles proposed for
  immunotherapy are pointed out here comprising organic/inorganic nanoparticles composed
  by lipid membranes and Calcium-Phosphate (CaP) for dual-targeted therapy using a
  small interfering RNA (siRNA) against immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 and the plasmid
  DNA (pDNA) encoding immunostimulatory cytokine IL-2. Gold nanoparticles coated with
  antibodies such as cetuximab inhibit the proliferative downstream pathway PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  axis (—) due to EGFR blocking. Polymeric nanoparticles and core/shell nanoparticles
  can carry an anti-CTLA-4 siRNA or anti PD-1 antibodies increasing the percentage
  (+++) of effector CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Liposome-like nanoparticles carry
  immunotherapy drugs such as Gemcitabine (GEM) and Paclitaxel (PTX) working as drug
  delivery system. Figure generated using Biorender (https://biorender.com).
