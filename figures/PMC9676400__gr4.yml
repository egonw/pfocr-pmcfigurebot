caption: VP1 inhibits IFN-β activation by selectively targeting IRF7. The cells were
  cotransfected with a pRL-TK-Luc control plasmid, STING expression plasmid with the
  empty vector or VP1 construct, together with the IRF7-Luc reporter (A) or TBK1-Luc
  reporter plasmid (B) for 24 h before luciferase assays. All data are presented as
  the means ± standard deviations from three independent experiments; *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns indicates comparison.
