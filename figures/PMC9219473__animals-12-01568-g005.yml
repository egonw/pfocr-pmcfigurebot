caption: Effects of Iturin A on STb-R-restricted mTORC1 pathway in semimembranosus
  muscle. (A) Western blotting analysis of IGF-1R, IRS-1, p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-S6K1,
  p-S6, p-4EBP1, and eIF4E in semimembranosus muscle shows the change of mTORC1 signaling
  pathway after being fed with Iturin A and STb-R. (B) Quantification of the western
  blotting results and the values of the relative protein level are represented as
  the ratio of IGF-1R/β-actin, IRS-1/β-actin, p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, p-mTOR/mTOR,
  p-S6K1/S6K1, p-S6/S6, p-4EBP1/4EBP1, and eIF4E/β-actin. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM, and the different lowercase letters above standard error bars indicate significant
  differences, n = 3.
