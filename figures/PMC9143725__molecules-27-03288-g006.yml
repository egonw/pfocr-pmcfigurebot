caption: Cytotoxic Effects of Dyglomera® on viability of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. There
  were no significant differences in cell viability between Dyglomera® 50, 100, or
  200 μg/mL treated groups and those not treated with Dyglomera®. Data are presented
  as mean ± standard deviation of triplicate experiments.
