caption: The roles of palmitoylation in inflammation. Palmitoylation affects inflammatory
  response in many ways. MYD88 is palmitoylated by ZDHHC6, facilitating downstream
  NF-κB inflammation pathway activation by mediating association with IRAF-4. NOD1/2
  is palmitoylated by ZDHHC5, which is required for membrane recruitment and downstream
  signaling. Five palmitoyl-transferases (localized at different cell compartments
  including ER and Golgi apparatus) positively regulate STING-dependent inflammatory
  response. The STAT3 palmitoylation–depalmitoylation cycle, catalyzed by DHHC7 and
  APT2, controls phosphorylation of STAT3 by JAK2 and contributes to STAT3 nuclear
  translocation, which is essential for IL-17–induced inflammation.
