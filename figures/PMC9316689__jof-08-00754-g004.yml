caption: 'Role of CWI pathway in the cytotoxic effect of fludioxonil in S. cerevisiae.
  (A) Western blotting showing the activation of CWI pathway upon fludioxonil treatment.
  Cells were grown in SD media (-His) at 28 °C until an OD600 of ~0.8 and treated
  with fludioxonil (25 µg/mL) for different time intervals. Total cell extract from
  these samples was used for western blotting analysis. Blots were analyzed using
  an anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody that recognizes the dual-phosphorylated form
  of ScMpk1 and anti-Hog1 antibody for total Hog1 (Hog1) for loading control. The
  data shown are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Fludioxonil
  sensitivity of Δmpk1 strain harboring two plasmids pRS313 and p426ClNik1 (Δmpk1),
  pMPK1-313 and p426ClNik1 (MPK1), pMPK1-54 and p426ClNik1 (K54R), pMPK1-83 and p426ClNik1
  (K83A), and pMPK1-196 and p426Nik1 (R196A) by dilution spotting on SD plate with
  25 μg/mL fludioxonil. Δmpk1 strain harboring plasmids pRS313 and pRS426 (vector)
  was used as control. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.
  (C) Relative growth of Δmpk1 strain harboring plasmids pRS313 (Δmpk1), pMPK1-313
  (MPK1), pMPK1-83 (K83A), pMPK1-54 (K54R), pMPK1-196 (R196A) along with p426ClNIK1
  on SD liquid media containing different concentrations of fludioxonil. The log phase
  culture of each mutant was used to inoculate the 96 well plates (98 µL/well) having
  serial dilutions of fludioxonil (2 µL/well). OD600 of each well at 0 h and then
  after 24 h of incubation at 28 °C was recorded. The graph represents the relative
  growth of the culture at each concentration of fludioxonil that was expressed as
  the percentage of the growth measured in the absence of fludioxonil. Graphs are
  plotted as mean ± SD. Error bars indicate standard deviations from three biological
  replicates assayed. Data were analyzed using Tukey’s multicomparison test. (ns,
  p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; ****, p < 0.0001). (D) Schematic representation of the role
  of Bem2 and its downstream target genes in the antifungal action of fludioxonil.
  Red arrows: negative interaction between the genes and the drug. Dotted arrows:
  genetic interaction unknown. Black arrows: positive interaction between the genes.'
