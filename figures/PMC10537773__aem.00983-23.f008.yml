caption: Comparison of DEGs in WT and mutants (ΔAomedA and ΔAowetA). (A) UpSet plot
  analysis of DEGs between ΔAomedA/ΔAowetA mutant versus WT strain. The bar chart
  on the bottom left represents the number of the up/downregulated DEGs. The dotted
  line at the bottom right shows the number of DEGs in the different groups. (B) Visual
  representation of gene expression correlation of sporulation-related genes. In the
  figure, each node represents a gene/transcript and the connection between nodes
  represents the correlation between gene/transcript expression. The size of nodes
  indicates the transcript levels of genes/transcripts, and indicates the transcript
  correlation between different genes/transcripts. Node size is positively correlated
  with transcription level of gene/transcript. (C) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
  of DEGs of ΔAomedA and ΔAowetA mutants versus WT strain. (D) Kyoto encyclopedia
  of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of ΔAomedA and ΔAowetA mutants versus
  WT strain.
