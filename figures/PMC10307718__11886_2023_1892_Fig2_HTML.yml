caption: Metabolism of the thienopyridines. Clopidogrel is a prodrug, most of which
  (~ 85%) is inactivated by hepatic esterases (namely CES1), with the remainder undergoing
  oxidative bioactivation in two sequential steps catalyzed by multiple CYPs. Prasugrel
  is a prodrug that is activated in a two-step pathway catalyzed by intestinal esterases
  (namely CES2) and multiple CYPs respectively. Polymorphisms shown in red decrease
  drug exposure; those in green increase drug exposure. Despite CYP2C19 being involved
  in the bioactivation of both prodrugs, polymorphisms of the enzyme appear to have
  negligible effect on prasugrel’s efficacy (indicated by dotted lines). CES1, carboxylesterase-1;
  CES2, carboxylesterase-2; CYPs, cytochrome P450 enzymes
