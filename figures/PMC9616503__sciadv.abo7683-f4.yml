figure_title: Detailed analysis of pod wall metabolism using different 13C sources
caption: '(A) 13C enrichment in PGA and hexose phosphate (HP) after 4 hours of culturing
  from independent or combined sources of 13CO2 and U-13C glucose. The results are
  means ± SE (n = 2) where four biological replicates were pooled to precisely measure
  low abundant metabolites. (B) Relative 13C enrichment (y axis) in pod wall metabolites
  after 16 hours of culturing from 13C sources including CO2, glucose, malate, glutamine,
  or alanine. Five different pathways are described: (1) Calvin Benson Cycle (CBC)
  represented by serine (SER) that is a close product of PGA; (2) a combination of
  glycolysis and CBC represented by HP and phenylalanine (PHE); (3) carbohydrate biosynthesis
  represented by UDP-glucose (UDPG) and sucrose; (4) TCA cycle represented by cis-aconitate
  (ACON), glutamate (GLU), succinate (SUCC), and aspartate (ASP); and (5) anaplerosis
  represented by pyruvate (PYR) labeling. Assorted colors represent the five sources,
  with the arrow color indicating the primary source used in a particular pathway.
  All abbreviations used are listed in data S3. The results are means ± SE (n = 3).'
