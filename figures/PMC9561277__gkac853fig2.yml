caption: APE1 overexpression leads to the activation of ATR–Chk1 DDR pathway independent
  of its nuclease and redox function in mammalian cells. (A) ATR–Chk1 DDR pathway
  was activated by the overexpression of YFP-APE1 but not YFP nor CTL transfection
  (no vector transfection) in MDA-MB-231 cells. After different times of incubation
  (i.e. 2, 3, 4 or 7 days), total cell lysates were extracted and examined via immunoblotting
  analysis as indicated. (B) Chk1 phosphorylation induced by YFP-APE1 was dependent
  on ATR, but not ATM nor DNA-PKcs. After 4-d overexpression of YFP-APE1 or YFP, different
  DDR kinase inhibitors (5 μM of VE-822, KU55933 or NU7441) were added to MDA-MB-231
  cells for 2 h, followed by total cell lysate extraction and immunoblotting analysis
  as indicated. (C) APE1 inhibitors almost had no noticeable effect on Chk1 phosphorylation
  by YFP-APE1 overexpression. After 2-day overexpression of YFP-APE1 or YFP, different
  APE1 inhibitors (1 μM of AR03, APE1i III or E3330) were added to MDA-MB-231 cells
  for 2 days, followed by total cell lysate extraction and immunoblotting analysis.
  (D) The endonuclease activity of WT or mutant (i.e. D308A, C64A, E96Q, ED) His-APE1
  was examined on 20% TBE gel. (E) The exonuclease activity of WT or mutant (i.e.
  D308A, C64A, E96Q, ED) His-APE1 was examined on 20% TBE gel. (F) Chk1 phosphorylation
  was triggered by WT/mutant YFP-APE1 (i.e. D308A, C64A, E96Q, ED) overexpression
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. After 4-day overexpression of WT/mutant YFP-APE1 or YFP in
  MDA-MB-231, total cell lysates were extracted and analyzed via immunoblotting analysis.
  The Chk1-P-S345/Chk1 data are presented as means ± SD, n = 3.
