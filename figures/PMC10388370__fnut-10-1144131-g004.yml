caption: 'Pertubation of metabolites on vitamin D pathway regarding BMI and HDP status.
  Metabolites in the enriched vitamin D3 pathway were first annotated by the Mummichog
  algorism in Metabanalyst via the empirical compound library and then verified by
  matching against the public database. PDd indicated the annotation was supported
  by the exact mass match in the public database. The current untargeted approach
  may not unambiguously identify the structural isomers because of lacking experimental
  spectra and chromatographic information in the in-house library. #metabolite determined
  to associate with BMI in the non-HDP and/or HDP group (); ## metabolite determined
  to associate with HDP in at least one of the BMI categories (); ### metabolite determined
  to associate with HDP and BMI by regression modeling (). The box plots of the annotated
  metabolites were based on the relative peak intensity of the corresponding signal
  (ΔRT_exact mass) and the classification with BMI categories (NW, normal weight;
  OW, overweight; OB, obese) and the HDP status (with-HDP, without HDP). The pairwise
  comparison between BMI category or between HDP status was conducted by student t-test
  or Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (if the sample size in one of the groups is <10). Pairwise
  comparisons: (a) HDP vs. without-HDP in NW; (b) with-HDP vs. without-HDP in OW;
  (c) with-HDP vs. without-HDP in OB; (d) OW vs. NW in with-HDP; (e) OB vs. NW in
  with-HDP; (f) OW vs. NW in without-HDP; (g) OB vs. NW in without-HDP. Comparisons
  with significant changes were labled in the box plots (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).'
