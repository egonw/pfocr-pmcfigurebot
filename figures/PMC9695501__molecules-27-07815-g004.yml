caption: 'The effect of RA on the expression levels of SOD, CAT, GSH, T-AOC, MDA,
  NO, and MPO in the liver and kidney of mice induced by CP. The liver and kidney
  tissues were homogenized, the supernatant was taken, and the antioxidant capacity
  of the liver and kidney tissues was detected by ELISA (aâ€“g). These experiments were
  repeated three times. * and # denote significant differences (p < 0.05) and ** and
  ## denote highly significant differences (p < 0.01) compared with the control and
  CP model groups, respectively.'
