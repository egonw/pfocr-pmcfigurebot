caption: Prediction of upstream signaling pathways regulating the predicted TFs(A)
  Number of phosphorylated peptides (left) and phosphorylated proteins (right) measured
  in the phosphoproteome obtained from . We divided the IRpPs into increased (red)
  and decreased (blue) IRpPs as shown in E. See also .(B) Enrichment analysis of possible
  substrates of each kinase for the increased and decreased IRpPs (q value <0.05,
  Fisher’s exact test). See also  and .(C) Number of PPIs measured at three different
  time points after insulin stimulation (0, 10, and 30 min after insulin stimulation)
  (). AP-MS data were measured for the 20 canonical insulin signaling proteins ().
  Note that the number of interactions, not the number of the preys, are shown. See
  also .(D) Method used for predicting upstream signaling pathways regulating the
  predicted TFs. See also .(E) Upstream signaling pathways regulating the predicted
  TFs. We predicted the signaling pathways from the insulin receptor to each of the
  TFs following the procedure shown in D and obtained the insulin signal layer by
  merging the pathways. The border colors of the nodes in the layer correspond to
  the colors shown in D. The pie charts on the nodes indicate the downstream TFs of
  the nodes. Data sources are shown on the right side of the nodes contained in the
  PPI and phosphorylation network with the color-coded for increased or decreased
  IRpPs (A). The edges derived from the PPIs of  are colored by the detected time
  point(s) (C), and the others are shown in grey. The network diagram was created
  using Cytoscape (). See also .(F) KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis of
  the upstream signaling pathways of each predicted TF. See also  and .
