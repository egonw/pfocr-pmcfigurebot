caption: 'The crotonylation levels of Gpd1 and Fabp4 were downregulated, while the
  crotonylation levels of Ak2, Tpi1 and Ndufa8 were upregulated. Note: (A) Summary
  figure: after mice were injected with CL316,243, the crotonylation modification
  of proteins in cells in vivo changed; dynamic regulation of the level of protein
  crotonylation modification can regulate TCA cycle metabolism, oxidative stress,
  aerobic respiration, insulin signaling pathway, glyoxylate and dicarboxylic acid
  metabolism pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, ATPase activity, mitochondrial function,
  etc., thereby regulating the browning of white fat in the body. (B) Interaction
  network analysis of crotonylated proteins and crotonylation-related enzymes; differentiated
  and mature adipocytes were treated with 20 mM NACr, and cellular RNA and protein
  were extracted. (C) Relative mRNA expression levels of acylation-related genes after
  NACr treatment (n = 4). (D) Expression and quantification of Pan-KCr protein after
  NACr treatment (n = 4). (E,F): Immunofluorescence and quantitative map of Pan-KCr
  protein after NACr treatment, scale bar: 200 μm (n = 4). (G,H) The relative mRNA
  and protein expression levels of Gpd1, Fabp4, Ak2, Tpi1 and Ndufa8 after NACr treatment
  (n = 4). Values are mean ± SD compared to the control group, * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01.'
