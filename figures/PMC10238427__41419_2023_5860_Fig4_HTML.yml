figure_title: MCR affected the proliferation and apoptosis of ESCC by regulating the
  expression of SLC43A2
caption: A The level of SAM and HCY was detected in both the control group and MCR
  group (cells in MCR group were cultured in the medium with 10 μM methionine and
  no cystine) by ELISA for 72 h. n = 5 for each group, ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t test. B CCK-8 assays was performed to detect the proliferation of ESCC
  cell lines in the control group (complete cell cultural medium), 20 μM group and
  10 μM group (cells in MCR group were cultured in the medium with 10 μM or 20 μM
  methionine and no cystine). n = 5 for each group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test, compared with the control group. C EdU assays
  were performed to detect the proliferation of ESCC in the control group and in MCR
  group after 72 h. The cells under proliferation were stained red under a fluorescence
  microscope. n = 5 for each group, ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t
  test, scale = 50 μm. D Apoptotic cells were stained green under a fluorescence microscope
  via TUNEL assays in control group and in MCR group after 72 h. n = 5 for each group,
  ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test, scale = 50 μm. E Bax, Bcl-2
  and cleaved-PARP expression were detected in control group and MCR group by western
  blot after 72 h. F The expression of SLC43A2 in ESCA cohort was analyzed in Tumor
  and Normal tissues according to TCGA database. ***P < 0.001. G The Kaplan–Meier
  analysis was performed to analyzed the correlations between overall survival rate
  and SLC43A2 expression in ESCC patients from TCGA database and GEO (GSE53265) database.
  H The SAM levels of ESCC cells were detected in control group, si-SLC43A2 group
  and si-SLC43A2 + 30 μM methionine group. All cells were cultured in complete cell
  culture medium after 72 h. n = 5 for each group, ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t test. I, J SLC43A2 expression in tumor tissues derived xenograft tumor
  model (I) and ESCC cells cultured in MCR condition (J) were detected by western
  blot. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5).
