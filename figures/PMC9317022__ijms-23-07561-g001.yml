caption: Activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by H. pylori. Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) 2, 4, and 5 recognize different extracellular bacterial factors
  to mediate MyD88-dependent or -independent activation of proinflammatory cytokine
  secretion. TLR7/8/9 recognize ingested bacterial DNA or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)
  in phagosomes for activation of type I interferons production. Transcription factors
  NF-ĸB, activator protein 1 (AP1), and IRF3/7 play prominent roles in transactivation
  of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. C-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs)
  including MINCLE also induce NF-ĸB through interaction with CARD9/BCL10/MALT1. DC-SIGN
  transmits signals through an unknown pathway during H. pylori infection. NOD-like
  receptors (NLRs) such as NOD2 activate the inflammasome complex to induce production
  and maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) such as retinoic
  acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) are activated by 5′triphosphate (PPP) single-stranded
  RNA, leading to conformation change, which subsequently activates Tank-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1). This, in turn, causes production of type I interferons through IRF3/7
  signaling.
