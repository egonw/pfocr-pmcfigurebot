caption: The impact of engeletin on multimodel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results
  in CSDS model mice. (A) Representative T1‐weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2‐weighted
  imaging (T2WI) images from the CON, CSDS, and engeletin groups. (B, C) Representative
  T2 mapping images and corresponding quantification. (C, D) Representative diffusion
  tensor imaging (DTI) images. (E, F) DTI index quantification (FA, ADC) in the bilateral
  prefrontal cortex. Results are means ± SEM (n = 12). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, one‐way
  ANOVAs with Bonferroni post hoc testing. ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient. CSDS,
  chronic stress social defeat stress.
