caption: 'IGF2BP3 regulated the stability of Linc00662 as a m6A reader. A. The knockdown
  of METTL3 in PC cells reduced the half-life of Linc00662 compared to that in control
  cells. B. The RNA Pull down/MS was conducted to identify the proteins bound to Linc00662.
  The image of silver staining was displayed to show the proteins pulled down. C.
  The results of MS showed that IGF2BP3 was the only member of the IGF2BPs bound to
  Linc00662. D. The secondary structure of IGF2BP3. E. The proteins pulled down with
  the Linc00662 probe were examined by western blotting and the results showed that
  IGF2BP3 was a component of the complexes. F. The RIP assay confirmed that Linc00662
  was enriched in the IGF2BP3 group but not in the IgG group. Bar chart showed the
  fold enrichment of Linc00662 normalized by IgG in PC cells. *: P < 0.05. G. Correlation
  analysis showed that IGF2BP3 expression was positively related with Linc00662 expression
  in PC tissues (P = 0.046) using the online bioinformatics analysis tool (GEPIA).
  H. IGF2BP3 was knocked down in PC cells using siRNAs. And IGF2BP3 si-2 showed the
  highest inhibitory efficacy by qPCR. I. IGF2BP3 was knocked down in PC cells using
  siRNAs and western blotting confirmed that IGF2BP3 si-2 showed the highest inhibitory
  efficacy. J. The knockdown of IGF2BP3 in PC cells reduced the half-life of Linc00662
  compared to that in control cells. Abbreviations: PC: pancreatic cancer, NC: negative
