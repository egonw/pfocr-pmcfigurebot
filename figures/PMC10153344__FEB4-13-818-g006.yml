caption: 'Increased MTT production of HeLa cells in the presence of 10 nm hUCN1. A
  significant increase in cell proliferation was measured by the applied MTT assay
  in the presence of 10 nm hUCN1 for 24 h compared with the untreated (Control) group.
  This effect of hUCN1 could be prevented in the presence of Antalarmin, a chemical
  inhibitor of CRF1 (Panel A). On the contrary, Astressin 2b, a specific inhibitor
  of CRF2 was not able to abolish the cell proliferation‐stimulating effect of hUCN1
  (Panel B). The values shown are presented by box + whiskers plots, indicating median
  (central horizontal line), min/max values, and mean (with ‘+’ within the box) of
  six independently performed experiments (n = 6, Panel A and B). Panel A: *P < 0.05
  Control vs. 24 h hUCN1 (10 nm), #P < 0.05 24 h hUCN1 (10 nm) vs. Ant + 24 h hUCN1
  (10 nm); Panel B: *P < 0.05 vs. Control (one‐way ANOVA, Tukey).'
