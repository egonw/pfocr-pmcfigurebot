caption: The schematic diagram of lncRNA HHIP-AS1/HHIP modulating osteogenic differentiation
  of BM-MSCs. lncRNA HHIP-AS1 bound to HHIP mRNA through complementary base pairing.
  This interaction increased ELAVL1 binding to HHIP mRNA and thus improved the mRNA
  stability and expression. HHIP protein can binds to SHH, which suppresses the activation
  of SMO by SHH. As the result, osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs induced by Hedgehog
  signal is suppressed.
