figure_title: CCL5 emerges as an upstream regulator of PBMC activation upon plasma
  stimulation
caption: a, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis performed using the DEGs in PBMCs from healthy
  donors stimulated with either atherosclerotic plasma (n = 20 biologically independent
  samples, 10 men) or plasma from healthy donors (n = 12 biologically independent
  samples) revealed the top upstream regulators. Upstream regulators were plotted
  using the activation z-score from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Fisher’s exact test
  was used; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. b, Differentially expressed
  cytokines in plasma from patients with atherosclerosis (n = 20 biologically independent
  samples, 10 men) versus healthy donors (n = 15 biologically independent samples).
  Dots represent plasma levels of the tested cytokines and are expressed as picograms
  per milliliter. Dotted line represents the average (Ave.). P values were calculated
  by two-tailed unpaired t-test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
  c, Heat map of phosphoprotein expression in both monocytes and CD1c+ DCs in PBMCs
  from healthy donors stimulated with healthy plasma alone (healthy) or in combination
  with CCL5 (10,000 pg µl−1), CXCL1 (600 pg µl−1), CXCL10 (200 pg µl−1), PDGF-AA (600 pg µl−1)
  and PDGF-BB (500 pg µl−1). z-Scores were used to identify the significant changes
  in phosphorylation levels (n = 3 biologically independent samples per condition).
  d, viSNE plot of all major PBMC cell types defined based on canonical expression
  patterns. e, Intracellular signaling patterns were visualized across this immune
  map in response to plasma from patients with atherosclerosis admixed with either
  an antihuman CCL5 antibody (0.16 µg µl−1; n = 6 biologically independent samples,
  3 men) or isotype control antibody (0.16 µg µl−1; n = 6 biologically independent
  samples, 3 men). Unstimulated PBMCs were included as control (no plasma). f, Dot
  plots show the effect of CCL5 blocking on the phosphorylation of intracellular kinases
  in CD14+ monocytes and CD1c+ DCs after stimulation with atherosclerotic plasma.
  P values were determined by unpaired two-tailed t-test.
