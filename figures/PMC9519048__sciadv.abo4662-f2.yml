figure_title: Induction of DNA DSBs is sufficient to elicit immune pathway signaling
  in neuron primary culture
caption: '(A) Left: Representative images of NeuN and γH2AX immunostaining in etoposide
  (ETP) and vehicle-treated primary cultures. Each data point represents γH2AX mean
  gray value for one nucleus. Right: Representative images of p65 immunostaining in
  ETP- and vehicle-treated primary cultures. Each data point represents p65 mean gray
  value for one nucleus. (B) Schematic of ETP treatment. DIV13 neuron primary cultures
  were treated with either 50 μM ETP or vehicle control (DMSO) for 6 hours. (C) Differential
  Gene Ontology (biological pathway) terms identified through GSEA from ETP versus
  DMSO contrast. (D) Left: Heatmap of stage 1 and stage 2 signature enrichment in
  DMSO- and ETP-treated neurons. Right: Quantification of stage 1 and stage 2 signature
  enrichment in DMSO- and ETP-treated neurons. Each data point represents one biological
  replicate. (E) Venn diagram of significantly up-regulated protein-coding genes from
  ETP-treated neurons and stage 1 and stage 2 gene signatures. Percentages are in
  reference to the total number of unique genes from all three gene sets. Genes overlapping
  in ETP and stage 2 are in turquoise. Genes overlapping in ETP, stage 2, and stage
  1 are in magenta. The area of the circles is in proportion to the size of the gene
  sets. Error bars represent SEM; ****P < 0.0001. Student’s t test (A). Wilcoxon test
  (D). Data are representative of three independent experiments (A).'
