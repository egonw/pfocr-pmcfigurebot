figure_title: Chinese medicines-effective compounds–hub targets–pathways–disease (C–E–H–P–D)
  network of Callicarpa nudiflora Hook et Arn. (CN) an-ti-neuroinflammation (NI).
  The C–E–H–P–D network of CN anti-NI was composed of 26 ingredients, 67 common targets,
  and 30 pathways, covering 125 nodes and 662 edges. The purple color represents herbs;
  green indicates bioactive compounds from CN; yellow stand for the target genes;
  blue represents signal pathway; red is the disease
