caption: 'Sodium cantharidate (SCA) inhibits tumorigenesis in nude mice. (A) Tumor
  signal intensity before and after SCA treatment. (B) Body weight change curves of
  nude mice during SCA treatment. (C) Tumor weight after 21 days of treatment. (D)
  Hematoxylin-eosin staining images (400×) of the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and
  tumor of nude mice after SCA treatment for 21 days, scale bar: 2 µm. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared with the control group).'
