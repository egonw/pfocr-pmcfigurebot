caption: 'Cholesterol biosynthesis precursors and cholesterol esters accumulate upon
  CBD treatment.A, pathway diagram of cholesterol biosynthesis. Quantified metabolic
  intermediates are outlined in black bold, and enzymes showing significant increase
  over time with CBD in proteomic analysis are shown in bold red (D). Dashed arrows
  indicate multiple intermediate steps that were not identified in the pathway. B, d-glucose
  (U-(13)C6) metabolically labeled cholesterol biosynthesis precursors at 24 h post
  20 μM CBD treatment. (Student’s t test: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001)
  (). C–F, total abundance of lipids quantified by LC–MS/MS from cell extracts of
  SK-N-BE(2) cells treated with vehicle or 20 μM CBD. Cholesteryl esters (CEs), fatty
  acids (FAs), phospholipids, and sphingomyelins (SMs) identified by mass spectrometry
  are displayed by peak area (, D and E). (Student’s t test: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗p < 0.001). CBD, cannabidiol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine.'
