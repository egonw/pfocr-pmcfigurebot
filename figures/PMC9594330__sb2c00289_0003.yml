caption: 'Biosynthetic yields of etoposide intermediates 7 days post infiltration
  promoted by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of CA pathway genes or single
  lignin-associated TFs in N. benthamiana leaves. DPT pathway: dirigent protein (PhDIR),
  pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase (PhPLR), secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase
  (PhSDH), PhCYP719A23, PhOMT3, PhCYP71CU1, PhOMT1, and Ph2ODD; EPT pathway: DPT pathway
  and PhCYP82D61; EA pathway: EPT pathway and PhCYP71BE54; No substrate: no exogenous
  addition of the substrate CA; 1 mM CA: exogenous addition of CA; CA pathway: eight
  canonical biosynthetic enzymes converting phenylalanine to coniferyl alcohol;, n.d.:
  no data; <LQ: below limit of quantification (<0.04 mg/g DW). Biosynthetic yields
  were quantified based on EIC peak integrations (m/z of [M + H]+) as detected by
  LCâ€“MS in comparison to standard curves. Bar heights show the means of biological
  triplicates, and error bars show standard deviations.'
