caption: PDZK1 has oncogenic roles by enhancing PI3K/AKT and fatty acid metabolism.
  (a) Heat map of all DEGs obtained by comparing PDZK1 top 20 high and top 20 low
  samples. (b) GO enrichment for biological process (BP) based on the DEGs. (c) KEGG
  enrichment based on the DEGs. (d) GSEA analysis for gene expression fold change
  between PDZK1 top 20 high and top 20 low samples. (e) GSEA plot for PI3K-AKT, fatty
  acid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation pathways. (f) Heat map for key genes
  representing PI3K-AKT, fatty acid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation signaling.
