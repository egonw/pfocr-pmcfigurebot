caption: SIRT7 suppresses MST1 transcription via H3K18 deacetylation. (A, B) HepG2
  and Huh7 cells were transduced with scrambled or SIRT7 shRNA (shSIRT7#1, shSIRT7#2)
  for 72 h, or transfected with Flag‐SIRT7 for 24 h, and protein levels of the Hippo
  pathway were analyzed using western blot. (C) Immunofluorescence staining of transfected
  Flag‐SIRT7 or Flag‐SIRT7 HY (red) and endogenous MST1 and MST2 (green). (D, E) mRNA
  expression levels of MST1/2 after SIRT7 knockdown (D) and Flag‐SIRT7 or Flag‐SIRT7
  HY overexpression (E). (F) Illustration of the MST1 promoter regions (MST1‐A, MST1‐B)
  accessed using ChIP analysis. (G) Promoter binding of SIRT7 to the MST1 promoter
  regions (MST1‐A, MST1‐B) was evaluated using ChIP assay in HepG2 cells using antibodies
  as indicated. (H–J) Cells were transduced with shSIRT7 or transfected with Flag‐SIRT7;
  acetylation levels within the promoter regions of MST1 (MST1‐A) were measured by
  ChIP assay using antibodies as indicated. Graphs are presented as means ± SD of
  at least three replicates. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
