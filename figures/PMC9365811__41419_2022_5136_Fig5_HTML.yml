figure_title: USP7 inhibits LUAD cell proliferation via modulation of the ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway
caption: A, B Wound healing assays were performed in Myc-USP7-transfected A549 and
  H1299 cells and mock vector-transfected A549 and H1299 cells as controls. And cell
  images were captured at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after scratch. Wound area (%) was determined
  by the rate of remaining wound area compared to control, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001,
  n = 4 (A549), n = 3 (H1299). C, D Colony-forming assays were performed in Myc-USP7-transfected
  A549 and H1299 cells and mock vector-transfected A549 and H1299 cells as controls.
  Cells were stained with crystal violet solution and cell images were captured. The
  number of colonies is analyzed by image J and calculated by a two-tailed Student’s
  t-test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n = 6 (A549), n = 4 (H1299). E Cell cycle analysis
  were performed in Myc-USP7-transfected H1299 cells and mock vector-transfected H1299
  cells as controls with flow cytometry. Cells were synchronized by double thymidine
  block and fixed by 70% ethanol and stained by FxCycle™ PI/RNase staining solution
  to analyze the cell cycle, and the percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases
  was measured in a time-dependent manner (0, 4, and 8 h). Representative data was
  shown from at least three independent experiments. F A549 cells were also synchronized
  by double thymidine block and fixed by 70% ethanol and stained by FxCycle™ PI/RNase
  staining solution to analyze the cell cycle, and the percentage of cells in G1,
  S, and G2/M phases was measured in a time-dependent manner (0, 6, 12, and 18 h).
  Representative data was shown from three independent experiments.
