caption: 'Effect of JDHY on the NF-κB signaling pathway in liver tissue of liver failure
  rats. Western blot was utilized to detect the expression of p-IKKβ/IKKβ, p-NF-κB/NF-κB,
  and p-IKβα/IKβα in liver tissue of rats in each group. It showed that the ratio
  of p-IKβα/IKβα, p-IKKβ/IKKβ, and p-NF-κB/NF-κB was significantly increased in the
  ALF group (n = 10), while JDHY (n = 10) could reduce their expression. ∗∗P < 0.01
  vs. control group (n = 6), ##P < 0.01 vs. ALF group (n = 10).'
