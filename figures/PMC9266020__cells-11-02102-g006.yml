caption: 'Proteome analysis of whole lung tissue lysate and bronchoalveolar lavage
  fluid. Panel (A): Volcano plot showing protein expression fold change values and
  their corresponding false discovery rate (−log10 p-value). Red points show statistically
  significant proteins with FDA > 1.3. Volcano plot on the left represents the whole
  lung tissue lysate proteome after angiotensin (1–7) stimulation normalized to untreated
  group. Volcano plot on the right represents the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid
  proteome after angiotensin (1–7) stimulation normalized to untreated group. Panel
  (B): Graph of mutual interactions between proteins drawn with the use of SPRING.org.
  Only proteins with altered expression in whole lung tissue lysate after stimulation
  of mice with angiotensin (1–7) were included in the analysis. The main biological
  processes by which the identified proteins are functionally related are marked with
  separate colors. With red color are labeled proteins involved in peptide metabolic
  process, with green color are labeled proteins involved in Interleukin-1 signaling
  pathway, with blue color are labeled proteins involved in cytoskeleton reorganization.
  Panel (C): Graph of mutual interactions between proteins drawn with the use of SPRING.org.
  Only proteins with altered expression identified in BALF after stimulation of mice
  with angiotensin (1–7) were included in the analysis. The main biological processes
  by which the identified proteins are functionally related are marked with separate
  colors. With red color are labeled proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization,
  with purple color are labeled proteins involved in MAPK family signaling cascades,
  with yellow color are labeled proteins involved in regulation of immune system processes.
  Panel (D): Graph represents the number of identified proteins in whole lung tissue
  lysate which were annotated to signaling pathways based on Reactome.org. With black
  color are labeled proteins which were not show altered expression after Ang (1–7)
  stimulation compared to untreated group. With red color are labeled protein with
  statistically significant change in expression after Ang (1–7) stimulation, when
  compared to untreated group. Panel (E): Annotation to detailed signaling pathways
  of immune system divided into Cytokine signaling in immune system labeled with blue
  color, Innate immune system labeled with red color, Adaptive immune system labeled
  with green color. Panel (F): Venn diagram that shows total number of identified
  proteins in whole lung tissue lysate (upper diagram) and BALF (lower diagram) from
  untreated and Ang (1–7)-treated groups.'
