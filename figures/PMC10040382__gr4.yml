caption: PA increases MARS transcription by activating the NF-κB pathway(A) PA activated
  the NF-κB pathway in cultured HEK293T and HL-1 cells. Cells were treated with PA
  for 4 h before harvesting.(B) Knockdown of RELA blocked the effect of PA on MARS
  mRNA expression (n = 5 biological replicates per group).(C) Knockdown of RELA blocked
  the effect of PA on activating MARS protein expression.(D) EMSAs showed RELA bound
  to the MARS promoter region in three species.(E) Effects of p65 on the transcription
  activities of the human MARS promoter in HEK293T cells and mouse Mars promoter in
  HL-1 cells, determined using dual-luciferase reporter assays (n = 3 biological replicates
  per group).(F) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR (top) and ChIP-qPCR (bottom)
  assays were performed using p65 antibody in both HL-1 and HEK293T cells untreated
  or treated with PA. Rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody was used as the control
  (n = 4 per group).(G) The NF-κB pathway was activated in the embryonic heart tissue
  of maternal high-PA-chow-fed mice, as detected by western blotting (n = 6 mice per
  group).(H) IHC staining of pIKKa/β and K-Hcy for embryonic heart sections of mice
  model. Scale bar, 500 μm (n = 3 mice for chow-diet group, n = 5 mice for high-PA
  group).The data are expressed as mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05,
  nsp > 0.05 using unpaired Student’s t tests.
