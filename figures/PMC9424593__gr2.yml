caption: 'Adenosine-induced decrease in CCND1 levels drives PD-L1 protein upregulation.
  (A) Comparative RNA-seq analysis of untreated and adenosine (200 μM)-treated human
  macrophages. In the network, each node represents a GO biological pathway, and the
  edges indicate the relationships among biological pathways, based on kappa values.
  (B) Genes most significantly influenced by adenosine treatment: cell cycle-related
  (50 genes) and DNA damage repair-related (38 genes). Cyclin D1 (CCND1) was selectively
  decreased upon adenosine treatment, at the mRNA (n = 4) (C) and protein levels (n =
  7) (D, E). (F) Representative histogram of 5 independent experiments and (G) quantitative
  measurements of PD-L1 expression following treatment with anti-CCND1 shRNA or negative
  control shRNA in the presence or absence of adenosine (200 μM) treatment, as analyzed
  using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Data have been presented as
  mean ± standard error of the mean. ns, not significant. ∗∗∗P < .001 (Student t test).'
