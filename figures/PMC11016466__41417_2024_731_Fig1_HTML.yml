figure_title: RanGAP1 is highly expressed in CRC and considered as a diagnostic indicator
caption: A RanGAP1 mRNA expression levels were higher in multiple cancers than in
  normal tissues based on TCGA data. B, C The mRNA expression levels of RanGAP1 based
  on TCGA and GSE68468 data. D, E RanGAP1 mRNA expression levels of patients with
  primary and metastatic colon cancer based on GEO datasets. F–H The protein expression
  levels of RanGAP1 were compared between CRC tissues and matched para-cancer tissues
  (n = 10), and were subsequently analyzed in Tissue Microarray samples of CRC and
  normal tissue. I The survival analysis between RanGAP1 expression and Recurrence
  free survival (RFS) of CRC based on KMplot data.
