caption: miR-26a-5p suppresses cell viability and stem cell-like phenotype in NSCLC.
  (a) The expression of miR-26a-5p was detected by qRT-PCR after miR-26a-5p upregulation/downregulation.
  (b) Cell viability was examined using CCK-8 assay after miR-26a-5p upregulation/downregulation.
  (c) Cell colony formation was determined by plate clone assay after miR-26a-5p upregulation/downregulation.
  (d) Cell cycle was detected by FCM after miR-26a-5p upregulation/downregulation.
  (e) CSC-like property was detected using sphere formation assay after miR-26a-5p
  upregulation/downregulation. (f) Protein levels of NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 were determined
  by western blotting after miR-26a-5p upregulation/downregulation. (g) CD34, CD133,
  and ALDH1 positive cells were identified by FCM after miR-26a-5p upregulation/downregulation.
  Control group was used as the blank control. ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
