caption: Expression of SECTM1 in data sets and clinical tissue samples. Kruskal-Wallis
  analyzed the relative expression difference of SECTM1 in patients with primary GBM,
  recurrent GBM and secondary GBM in the CGGA database (A). Kruskal-Wallis analyzed
  the relative expression difference of SECTM1 in Grade II, III and IV glioma patients
  in the CGGA database (B). C-F was the relative expression difference of SECTM1 in
  IDH mutation and wild-type patients (C), different sex patients (D), 1p19q deletion
  and non-deletion patients (E), and patients younger than 41 years old and older
  than 41 years old (F). In the CGGA database, Kruskal-Wallis analyzed the relative
  expression difference of SECTM1 in different histological grades of GBM (G), H-J
  was RT-qPCR (H) or western blot (I-J) to detect the relative expression difference
  of SECTM1 in normal brain tissue, LGG tissue and GBM tissue. K-M was IHC staining
  (K) and immunofluorescence staining (L-M) to detect the relative expression difference
  of SECTM1 in glioma II, III and IV patients, respectively, with scales of 2μm and
  10μm. All data were analyzed by T-test for P-values as the mean ±SEM of three independent
  experiments. ** P <0.01; *** P < 0.001; **** P < 0.0001.
