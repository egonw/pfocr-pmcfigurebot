figure_title: Effect of HFPGE on NO production and iNOS mRNA expression in RAW 264.7
  cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate and
  incubated. After 48 h, cells were serum-starved with serum-free DMEM for 2 h, and
  treated with the indicated concentration of HFPGE in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. The
  24-h conditioned media were collected. (A) NO production was determined using the
  Griess reagent system. (B) Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and real-time
  PCR was performed. iNOS mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH and presented relative
  to the 0 μg/mL group. Each bar expresses the mean ± SEM (n = 6). Means without the
  same letter differ, P < 0.05
caption: DMEM, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium; HFPGE, hydrolyzed and fermented
  Platycodon grandiflorum extract; LPS, 0.1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide; NO, nitric oxide;
  iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
