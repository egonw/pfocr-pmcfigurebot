caption: SPX increases mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes. (A) The
  levels CYT-B/actinin 100 nM SPX-treated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after 3 h.
  (B) Representative transmission electronic microscopic images from 100 nM SPX-treated
  differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Original magnification, ×15,000 (Red arrows indicate
  the mitochondria). (C) MitoTracker Green staining of mitochondria in 3T3-L1 cells
  (Original magnification, 600×, scale bar = 50 μm). All values are represented as
  means with error bars representing S.D. In the bar graph, *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.
