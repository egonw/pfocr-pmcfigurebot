caption: Oxaliplatin inhibits the Nrf2 signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells.
  Western blotting was performed to detect the levels of the Nrf2 signaling pathway-related
  proteins Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 in the control group and the groups treated with oxaliplatin
  concentrations of 1, 2 and 3 µM. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001. Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1;
  NQO1, NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1.

  cancer cells by inhibiting the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
