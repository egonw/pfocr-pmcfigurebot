caption: Scheme summarizing the protective effects of SalB inhalation on PM2.5-induced
  inflammatory and oxidative stress. SalB and ST2825 resulted in effective protection
  against PM2.5-induced acute airway inflammation and oxidative stress. These effects
  were closely correlated to the inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF-6/NLRP3 pathway
  and the activation of the ERK1/2 and P38 signaling pathway.
