caption: Infiltration of M1-TAM in human hepatoma tissue is associated with the therapeutic
  effects in patients with liver cancer. (A-C) Immunohistochemistry was used to detect
  the expression levels of CD68 (red) and HLA-DR (brown) in a hepatoma tissue, and
  representative images of immunohistochemical detection of CD68+HLA-DR+-labeled M1-like
  TAM in case of (A) no expression in a male patient (age, 53 years) with therapeutic
  efficacy rated as CR; (B) low expression in a male patient (age, 49 years) with
  therapeutic efficacy rated as PR; and (C) high expression in a male patient (age,
  58 years) with therapeutic efficacy rated as NR (magnification, ×200). (D) Number
  of CD68+HLA-DR+ (M1-TAM) cells in the hepatoma tissue of patients with liver cancer.
  HLA, human leukocyte antigen; TAM, tumor-associated macrophages; CR, complete remission;
  PR, partial remission; NR, no remission.
