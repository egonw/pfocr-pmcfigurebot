caption: Cell viability of HT-29 cells after treatment with naringenin or FEN. The
  effect of (a) naringenin (50–500 µM) and of (b) FEN (25–43%) was evaluated on HT-29
  cells after 24 h post incubation (MTT assay). Viability is expressed as a percentage
  of cellular activity between the exposed group to naringenin (a) and FEN (b). The
  experimental data are expressed as the mean value ± SD of the three independent
  experiments with three replicates each one. Letters indicate statistical difference
  (p < 0.05).
