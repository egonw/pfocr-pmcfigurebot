caption: 'SMURF2 positively regulates KAP1 protein levels in tumor cells. (A) Western
  blot analysis showing that overexpression of SMURF2WT, but not its E3 ligase-inactive
  mutant (SMURF2CG), enhances the protein abundance of KAP1 in osteosarcoma U2OS cells.
  (B) Immunoblot analysis showing diminished protein levels of KAP1 in SMURF2 knockdown
  U2OS cells. Two different siRNAs targeting SMURF2 mRNA expression at either 3′UTR
  or coding sequence (CDS) were used. NS—non-silencing siRNA. (C) Immunoblot analysis
  of KAP1 expression in SMURF2CRISPR knockdown U2OS cells (SMURF2CR, left panels)
  and in cells following SMURF2 reconstitution (right panels). SMURF2CR cells were
  reconstituted with FLAG-SMURF2. Cells transduced with an empty FLAG vector were
  used as a control. (D) Western blot analysis showing the effect of SMURF2 knockdown
  on KAP1 protein levels in different types of human cancer cells: cervix carcinoma
  HeLa cells, prostate carcinoma DU-145 cells, and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-468 cells.
  Non-silencing siNS and shLuc were used as controls for siRNA and shRNA experiments,
  respectively. (E,F) Confocal microscopy analysis of KAP1 expression in SMURF2 knockdown
  MDA-MB-468 cells. Scale bars: 20 µm. Quantification of the results (panel F) is
  shown as mean ± SD. n—number of cells quantified for each group from 10 different
  fields. (G) Western blot analysis of KAP1 protein expression in SMURF2 knockdown
  U2OS cells treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (5 µM; 4 h). The inhibition
  of the proteasomal pathway by MG-132 was verified using anti-poly-ubiquitin-K48-specific
  antibody. (H) Quantification of data shown in (G) from two independent experiments.
  Data are mean ± SD. The uncropped Western blot images can be found in .'
