caption: The effect of AEG-1/miR-221 was analyzed on cell cycle and angiogenesis regulatory
  proteins in HCC cell lines. The relative AEG-1 protein expression in THLE-2, HepG2,
  Huh7, and Hep3B cells (A) and miR-221 mimic-, miR-221 inhibitor-, and AEG-1 siRNA-transfected
  HCC cells (B). The regulatory protein expressions which regulate angiogenesis (LSF
  and MMP 9) and cell cycle (p57, p53, and RB) were analyzed in miR-221 mimic-, miR-221
  inhibitor-, AEG-1 siRNA-, and their controls-transfected HepG2 (C), Huh 7 (D), and
  Hep3B (E) cells by western blot. p-Values presented as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,***
  p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 and error bars presented as the mean ± s.d. ns—(non-significant)
  compared to the controls.
