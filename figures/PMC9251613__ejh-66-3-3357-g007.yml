caption: 'Inhibition of HMGB1 suppresses the NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo. Expression
  of phospho-p65 in the synovium (A) and cartilage (B) of CFA groups, CFA with anti-HMGB1
  antibody treatment groups at day 21 were detected by IF staining, or in the control
  groups; data are shown as the means with 95% CI and analyzed by one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA), n=5, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001; scale bar: 100 μm. C) Schematic
  diagram of inhibition of HMGB1 suppresses inflammation and catabolism in temporomandibular
  joint osteoarthritis via NF-κB signaling pathway.'
