caption: Identification of transcriptional signatures of resistance and differentiation
  in BRAFV600E mutant MaMel cells. A Soft clustering based on the top 30% of genes
  with the highest variance across MaMel cell lines. The number of genes within every
  cluster is indicated in brackets; only genes with a minimum membership score of
  0.7 are included. Some of the main significantly over-represented (q < 0.05) hallmarks
  and biological processes for every cluster are annotated next to the respective
  plot. B Normalized expression (z-score) from genes (n = 1549) corresponding to the
  MITF/SOX10 transcriptional signature []. C Normalized expression (z-score) from
  transcription factors with enriched targets within the clusters identified on A.
  D Transcriptome diversity, and E specialization of MaMel cells. F Heatmap displaying
  the normalized expression (z-score) of the 10% of genes with the highest variance
  across MaMel cell lines, human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), and human epidermal melanocytes
  (HEM). Some of the main significantly over-represented (q < 0.05) biological processes
  and pathways are annotated alongside the clusters of genes (identified by k-means
  clustering) with similar expression patterns across the samples. G Enrichment score
  (ES) of transcriptional signatures of progressive melanoma dedifferentiation
