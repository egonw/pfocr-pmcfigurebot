caption: Heatmaps and volcano plots of differentially expressed genes in brain tissue
  after latent herpesvirus infection. Heatmaps and volcano plots of differentially
  expressed genes in the brain tissue after infection with wild-type herpes simplex
  virus (HSV)-1 (A, B) and mutant HSV-1 (C, D) are shown. In the volcano plots, red
  dots represent genes with high differential expression, cyan dots represent genes
  with low differential expression, and black dots represent genes with no differential
  expression. The MOCK group had a sample size of n = 3, the MHV-68 group had n =
  3, and the ORF73 group had n = 3.
