caption: (A) Histological representation showing lobular inflammation in injury groups
  at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W compared to VC groups. Periportal necrotic bodies (Black arrow)
  in injury group at 7 W, pigmented macrophages (Black arrow) in injury group at 14 W
  and infiltration of inflammatory cells in injury group at 21 W was observed (20X
  microphotographs). (B, C, D, E&F) Differential expression of Il1-β, Il6, Il-10,
  Tnf-α and Tgf-β mRNA was observed in injury groups at 7 W, 14 W and 21 W compared
  to VC groups. The graphical data presented in mean ± S.D. and significant level
  was considered as p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001.
