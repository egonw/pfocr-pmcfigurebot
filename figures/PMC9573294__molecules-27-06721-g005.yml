caption: The effect of 2′3′-cGAMP and TGF-ꞵ in the presence of ENPP1 inhibitor on
  the expression level of EMT markers. (A–C) EMT was induced in MDA-MB-231 cells through
  TGF-ꞵ treatment (10 ng/mL) for periods of 24, 48, and 72 h. The cells were consecutively
  treated with 2′3′-cGAMP alone and in combination with AVA-NP-695. (D) Mean cell
  lengths with the treatment of TGF-ꞵ along with 2′3′-cGAMP and AVA-NP-695 from each
  time point and group were plotted. Cell length was analyzed using ImageJ. (E,F)
  The gene expression of VIM and N-CAD was evaluated through real-time PCR and the
  data were normalized using GAPDH (n = 3). (G,H) Low-ENPP1-expressing A549 Dual™
  cells were treated with TGF-β, cGAMP, and TGF-β and TGF-β, cGAMP, and AVA-NP-695
  for 48 h; VIM (G) and N-CAD (H) mRNA expression levels were evaluated using RT-PCR
  (n = 3). (I) The schematic representation showing the cumulative conclusion of the
  experiment. The p-values were calculated with respect to the no-treatment group
  using ordinary one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s test. For comparison
  between two internal groups, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed. *<0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
