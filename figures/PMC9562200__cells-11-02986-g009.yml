caption: Effect of non-viable Lactobacillus gasseri strains on the expression of negative
  regulators of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway in porcine alveolar
  macrophages after the activation of TLR3. Alveolar macrophages were stimulated with
  non-viable L. gasseri TMT36 (HK36), TMT39 (HK39), or TMT40 (HK40) and then challenged
  with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). The expression of Tollip, A20, MKP-1, Bcl-3, SIGIRR
  and IRAK-M were analyzed by qPCR. Non-lactobacilli treated alveolar macrophages
  challenged with poly(I:C) were used as controls. The results represent data from
  three independent experiments. Significant differences were observed when compared
  to polyI(:C)-challenged control porcine alveolar macrophages. * (p < 0.05).
