caption: 'The expression of IL-1β in serum and weight-matched strategy for analyzing
  the relationship between diet FAs and OA severity. (a) The concentration of IL-1β
  in serum was detected by ELISA, n = 5. (b) The mice whose weights were in the range
  of 33 to 44 grams were used for OA analysis at 26 weeks of feeding. The line of
  the box indicated median, and the length of the box represented interquartile range.
  (c) DMM-operated to sham-operated joint OA score ratio of the weight-matched mice.
  The data are presented as the means ± SD. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 versus the LD
  group; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 versus the SFA group; ^p < 0.05 and ^^p < 0.01 versus
  the MUFA group; &p < 0.05 and &&p < 0.01 versus the n-6 group.'
