figure_title: Top subtype-specific molecular pathways associated with differentially
  methylated or expressed genes
caption: (A and C) Radial plots for methylation- or RNA-based pathways, respectively.
  The radio represents the presence level (as a percentage) of pathways in each tissue-specific
  AD subtype. The full molecular pathway names are listed in table S4. (B and D) Molecular-based
  similarity (overlapping) across brain-based (ROSMAP) and blood-based (ADNI) AD subtypes.
  Each pairwise value was calculated as the percentage of common number of differentially
  expressed pathways relative to the total.
