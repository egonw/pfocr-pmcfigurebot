caption: 'Regulation of five signaling pathways on alveolar injury and repair during
  sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS. The activation of STAT3 can enhance the effect of proinflammatory
  macrophages (M1) on cytokine storm. The activation of STAT3 can also activate Treg
  cells to increase the secretion of IL-10 to promote the proliferation and differentiation
  of AT2 cells (lung regeneration) during the alveolar injury and repair. NF-κB pathway
  recruits M1 to produce cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6), which promote the cytokine storm
  and the development of ALI/ARDS. Inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway by dual-specificity
  phosphatase (DUSP) can inhibit inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS. The mTOR signaling
  pathway and Notch signaling pathway can promote M1 to produce cytokine to aggravate
  the inflammation of ALI/ARDS. FGF21 increases the incidence of ALI/ARDS by regulating
  glucose and lipid metabolism through the mTOR signaling pathway. MSC exosomes can
  inhibit ALI/ARDS by inducing autophagy and pulmonary regeneration. The Notch signaling
  pathway can also promote Dcreg cells to produce IL-10 to inhibit ALI/ARDS. DHMEQ:
  dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin; M1: proinflammatory macrophages; M2: anti-inflammatory
  macrophages; DUSP: dual-specificity phosphatase; BRL: BRL-44408 maleate; FGF21:
  fibroblast growth factor 21; Arg-1: Arginase-1; Treg cell: regulatory T cell; SIRT1:
  Sirtuins1; DCregs: regulatory dendritic cells.'
