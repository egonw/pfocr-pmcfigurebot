caption: The regulatory circuit of LOXL2 up‐regulation and its downstream factors
  in the collagen‐enriched microenvironment. (A) A total of 369 patients with liver
  cancer from TCGA were divided into two groups (n = 185 and n = 184) based on the
  median expression of LOXL2. GSEA (version 4.1) was used to perform pathway enrichment
  between the LOXL2‐high and LOXL2‐low groups. The top three enriched pathways with
  NES ≥2 and FDR ≤0.01 in LOXL2‐high groups are shown. (B) Pearson's correlation between
  LOXL2 and HIF1A in TCGA‐LIHC (n = 369). (C) Relative firefly luminescence in luciferase‐NC
  and LOXL2‐promoter‐luciferase‐NC groups with and without HIF1A overexpression, normalized
  by Renilla luminescence. (D) Log2 fold changes of different integrins in HepG2 and
  Miha groups based on whole transcriptome sequencing, and Pearson's correlation between
  LOXL2 and these integrins based on TCGA‐LIHC data (n = 369). (E) Pearson's correlation
  between LOXL2 and major components in focal adhesion signaling based on TCGA‐LIHC
  data (n = 369). (F) Changes of ITGA5 and ROCK1 expression between VEC and LOXL2‐overexpressed
  cells, determined by western blot. (G) Changes of ITGA5, ROCK1, PXN, and VCL expression
  after LOXL2 knockdown in SNU‐878 cells, measured by quantitative reverse‐transcription
  polymerase chain reaction. (H) Changes of key proteins in the focal adhesion signaling
  after LOXL2 knockdown in SNU‐878 cells, determined by western blot. (I) Chemoresistant
  effects of LOXL2 and its direct downstream effector ITGA5 calculated by the CARE
  software. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. CARE, computational analysis of resistance;
