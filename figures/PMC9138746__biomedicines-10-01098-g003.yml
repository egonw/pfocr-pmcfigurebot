caption: csGRP78 functions as a signaling receptor that mediates cell proliferation
  or apoptosis. At the cell surface, GRP78 associates with GPI-anchored proteins.
  Activated α2M binds to csGRP78 and activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, which stimulates
  the PDK1/PLK1 pathway to upregulate c-MYC expression and cell proliferation (red
  arrows). Similarly, T-cadherin interacts with GRP78 to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway
  and stimulates GSK3β to increase cell proliferation (green arrows). Furthermore,
  Cripto binds to csGRP78 and inhibits TGF-β-mediated Smad2/3 activation and results
  in cell proliferation (yellow arrows). Cell surface GRP78 can also induce apoptosis
  through isthmin-1 interacting with csGRP78 to allow for GRP78 internalization. This
  leads to the inhibition of mitochondrial ATP transport and apoptosis (blue arrows).
  Furthermore, Kringle 5 interacts with csGRP78, which enhances caspase 7 activity
  (purple arrows). Moreover, Par-4 binds to GRP78 and activates the FADD-induced caspase
  8/caspase 3 pathway to lead to apoptosis (maroon arrows). Image generated with BioRender.
