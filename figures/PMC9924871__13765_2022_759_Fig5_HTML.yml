caption: Baicalein triggered ERS to induce apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway
  via the activation of BTG3. A PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT proteins determined by
  Western blot; B Expressions levels of Grp78, and CHOP determined by Western blot;
  C Intracellular Ca2 + levels measured using Fluo-3 AM fluorescent probes; D Intercellular
  Ca2 + levels measured using flow cytometry; E Apoptosis detected by flow cytometry.
  Cell experiment was duplicated thrice, and the data were expressed as mean ± SD.
  One-way ANOVA was used for comparisons among multiple groups, followed by Tukey’s
  test. *p < 0.05, **p<0.01, ***p < 0.001

  reticulum stress via repression of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
