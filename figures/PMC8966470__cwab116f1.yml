caption: (A) illustrates in cartoon form the endoplasmic reticulum (red) and cis-,
  medial- and trans-Golgi compartments (blue, yellow and green, respectively). Monosaccharide
  symbols follow the Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans system (). Shown in the figure
  are the steps required for synthesis of Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 after the initial
  transfer of the sugar precursor to the protein. (B) details the graphical location
  of glycan intermediates along this biosynthetic pathway for a specific Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2.
  The color scheme is the same as the ER/Golgi subdomains in (A). (C) is a zoomed-in
  image of (B), highlighting further processing that may occur within a given HexNAcHex
  composition. Core fucosylation is indicated by a rightward shift of 0.2 units. Each
  sequential addition of sialic acid is indicated by an upward shift of 0.2 units.
  The exact order of fucose and sialic acid addition is not necessarily fixed, leading
  to multiple pathways to go from Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 to Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2Fuc1SA2.
  (D) shows the likely biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of a specific HexNAc5Hex4.
  HexNAc5Hex4 is synthesized from HexNAc4Hex3 by the addition of a HexNAc and a galactose,
  and as addition of galactose is thought to inhibit N-acetyl-glucosamine transferases
  (GnTs), the addition of HexNAc occurs before the final galactosyltransferase step.
  (E) illustrates the potential biosynthetic pathways for a specific tetra-antennary
  HexNAc6Hex7SA2. Following the same logic as (B), addition of the GlcNAc arms proceeds
  prior to addition of any galactose. The two terminal sialic acids may have been
  added directly to HexNAc6Hex7SA2 or to any intermediates in which galactose was
  already present. The regions of the graph corresponding to high-mannose; hybrid;
  complex and paucimannose regions are indicated with arrows. An important caveat
  to the use of this representation is that in many instances, the researcher will
  not know the exact branching pattern for a given glycan, and therefore, multiple
  distinct glycans may occur at single positions in this map. Distinct isomers will
  have alternative routes within this map. This will limit the ability to precisely
  calculate biosynthetic fluxes.
