caption: FPD5 increased the protein level of p53 in the nucleus of A549 cells. (A,B)
  The influence of different concentrations of FPD5 (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20 μM) for
  24 h on the protein level of p53 in the A549 cell line was analyzed by Western blot.
  (C,D) A549 cells were treated with 5 µM FPD5 for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h. The protein
  level of p53 was examined by Western blot. (E–G) The A549 cell line was treated
  with FPD5 (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10 μM) for 24 h. The nucleus and cytoplasm were extracted
  for Western blot, respectively. Data are mean  ±  SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  N.S., not significant, n = 3.
