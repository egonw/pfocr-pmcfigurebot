caption: Pretreatment of narcissoside (NCS) attenuated apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells
  induced by 6-OHDA exposure. (A) Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations
  of NCS for 24 h and then cell viability was measured using CellTiter Blue Cell Viability
  Assay. The DMSO concentration applied is 0.1%. (B) Experimental cells following
  (A) were treated with 100 μM 6-OHDA for an additional 18 h. Cell viability was determined
  by CellTiter Blue Cell Viability Assay. (C) The ratio of cell apoptosis was analyzed
  using annexin V-FITC binding and propidium iodide (PI) uptake. FITC and PI fluorescence
  was measured by flow cytometry. (Top). Q1 is a dead cell, Q2 is a late apoptotic
  cell, Q3 is a live cell, and Q4 is an early apoptotic cell. The apoptosis rate was
  quantified by (Q2 + Q4)/(Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) × 100% (bottom) (D) The ratio of cleaved
  caspase 3/pro caspase 3 and cleaved PARP/pro PARP was determined by western blotting
  and β-tubulin was internal control (left). The intensity of the signal was quantified
  by the ImageJ software. (right).
