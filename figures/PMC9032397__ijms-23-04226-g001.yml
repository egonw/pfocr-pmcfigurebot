caption: Schematic illustration of vitamin D synthesis pathway. Moreover, 7-dehydrocholesterol
  in the epidermis layer of skin absorbs UV-B radiation and is converted to pre-vitamin
  D3. Vitamin D3, by either the isomerization of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal basal
  layers or intestinal absorption from the diet, binds to vitamin D-binding protein
  (DBP) in the bloodstream, transported to the liver. Vitamin D3 is hydroxylated by
  25-hydroxylase or sterol 27-hydroxylase. The resultant calcidiol (25(OH)D3) is 1α-hydroxylated
  in the kidney by 1α-hydroxylase, yielding biologically active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3).
