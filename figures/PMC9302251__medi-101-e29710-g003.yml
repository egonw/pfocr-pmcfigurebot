caption: GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis based on pyroptosis-related
  DEGs with pooled Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas
  cohort. (A) Bubble chart for GO enrichment of pyroptosis-related DEGs. Size of bubble
  indicates the number of significant genes in the given enriched term. Color denotes
  adjusted P value. The closer the color is to red, the more significant the enrichment
  is. (B) Barplot chart for GO enrichment of pyroptosis-related DEGs. Length of the
  bar indicates the number of significant genes in the given enriched term. Color
  signifies adjusted P value. The closer the color is to red, the more significant
  the enrichment is. (C) Bubble chart for KEGG pathway of pyroptosis-related DEGs.
  (D) Barplot chart for KEGG pathways of pyroptosis-related DEGs. COVID-19 = coronavirus
  disease 2019, DEG = differentially expressed gene, GO = gene ontology, KEGG = Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, IL = interleukin, NOD = nucleotide binding oligomerization
  domain, TNF = tumor necrosis factor.
