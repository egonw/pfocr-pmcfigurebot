caption: 'Activation of TRKB signaling in ∆K280 tauRD-DsRed SH-SY5Y cells. (A) Experimental
  flow chart. On day 1, cells were plated with retinoic acid (RA, 10 µM) added to
  the culture medium. On day 2, LMDS-1/2 (10 µM) was added to the cells for 8 h, followed
  by inducing ∆K280 tauRD-DsRed expression with doxycycline (Dox, 2 µg/mL). Kinase
  inhibitors U0126 or wortmannin (10 µM) were added to the cells on day 6. On day
  8, total and/or phosphorylated ERK, AKT, TRKB, CREB, BDNF, BCL2 and BAX levels were
  measured. (B) p-ERK (T202/Y204), ERK, p-AKT (S473), AKT, (C) p-TRKB (Y516 and Y817),
  TRKB, p-CREB (S133), CREB, pro/m-BDNF (31/13 kDa), BCL2 and BAX levels analyzed
  by immunoblotting using GAPDH as a loading control (n = 3). To normalize, protein
  expression level in untreated cells was set at 100%. p values: comparisons between
  induced vs. uninduced cells (#: p < 0.05, ##: p < 0.01), compound-treated vs. untreated
  cells (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01), or kinase inhibitor-treated vs. untreated cells
  (&: p < 0.05, &&: p < 0.01, &&&: p < 0.001) (one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey
  test).'
