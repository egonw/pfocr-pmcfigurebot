caption: PC-induced Nrf2 protein stability and ubiquitination in MOKE-K cells. (a)
  Intervention with 5 μg/mL PC for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min and the control group
  for 24 h (100 μg/mL CHX for 1 h). All tests were repeated at least three times.
  (b–d) PC-induced Nrf2 relative protein levels in MODE-K cells. “M” is Easysee protein
  marker, “Ctrl” is the control group, and GAPDH is the internal control. “∗” represents
  P < 0.05 compared with the CHX control group, “∗∗” represents P < 0.01 compared
  with the CHX+PC control group. “#” represents P < 0.05 compared with the CHX control
  group, and “##” represents P < 0.01 compared with the CHX+PC control group.
