figure_title: mPTCL has an oncogenic β‐catenin mutation and overactive MYC
caption: Allele frequencies of predicted deleterious mutations detected by exome sequencing
  of mPTCL T‐cells (n = 4). Deleterious variants have a SIFT (sorting intolerant from
  tolerant) score ≤ 0.05. In red are OncoKB‐listed oncogenes or tumor suppressors.
  Each oncogene in red has a SIFT score = 0, indicating high likelihood to be deleterious.
  Bars represent SEM. The dotted line represents the lower allele frequency cutoff
  for clonal heterozygous variants.IHC for β‐catenin in spleens (left) and magnified
  regions of mesenteric lymph node (right) in a normal C57bl/6J mouse and a mouse
  with mPTCL. Images are representative of six mice.Ingenuity pathway analysis predicted
  upstream regulators in purified TCRvβ8+ mPTCL versus CD4+ T‐cells (n = 6). A selection
  of upstream regulators is shown. The full set can be found in Dataset . Z‐score
  ≥ 2 or ≤ 2 represents predicted activation or inhibition of a regulator, respectively.Log2‐transformed
  expression levels of Myc transcript in TCRvβ8+ versus wildtype CD4+ T‐cells (n = 6).
  Adjusted P = 5.78E‐08. P‐values were calculated by ROSALIND.Immunostain for c‐MYC
  in mPTCL versus C57bl/6J spleens (representative of three mice).Western blot for
  c‐MYC in whole spleen lysates from control C57bl/6J and mPTCL mice. Quantification
  of c‐MYC expression normalized to vinculin housekeeper gene levels (n = 6). T‐test
  P = 0.0007. Bars represent SEM.GSEA for the top 12 (of 16) enriched MYC‐regulated
  gene signatures in purified TCRvβ8+ lymphoma cells. Red line indicates FDR q = 0.05.
  FDR Q‐values can be found in Dataset . *** P < 0.001.
