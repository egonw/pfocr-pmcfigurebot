caption: Significant enrichment pathway analysis of metabolites which showed accumulation
  in roots (A) and leaves (B) after the application of SWE. The y-axis (-log (p))
  indicates the p-value of the pathway enrichment analysis, represented by the bubble
  color (darker color means more significant enrichment). The x-axis is the impact
  factor of topological analysis, represented by the bubble size (bigger bubble means
  a higher impact).
