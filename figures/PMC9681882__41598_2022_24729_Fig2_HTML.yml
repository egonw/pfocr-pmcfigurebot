caption: Protein–protein pathway analysis illustrating significantly upregulated proteins
  in POTS. Protein–protein interaction analysis of 18 out of 19 upregulated proteins
  with association networks detected by STRING in POTS. In the network figures, each
  protein is represented by a colored node while protein–protein interaction and association
  are represented by a line. The strongest network interactions in POTS were particularly
  associated with a hypercoagulable state and upregulated expression of proteins related
  to platelet activity, but also enhanced inflammation, cardiac contractility and
  hypertrophy, skeletal muscle expression, and adrenergic activity. Complete names
  of proteins are found in Table .
