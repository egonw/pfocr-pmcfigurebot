caption: The impact of GART inhibition on E2:ERα signaling to cell proliferation.
  (A) Western blot of presenilin 2 (pS2), cathepsin D (CatD), cyclin D1 (CycD1), Bcl-2,
  and ERα expression levels in MCF-7 cells pre-treated with lometrexol (LMX 1 µM)
  for 48 hours and then treated for 24 hours with 17β-estradiol (E2 - 10 nM). The
  loading control was done by evaluating vinculin expression in the same filter. Panels
  show representative blots. Densitometric and statistical analyses are reported in
  . (B) Western blot of presenilin 2 (pS2), cyclin D1 (CycD1), Bcl-2, and ERα expression
  levels in MCF-7 cells pre-treated with GART siRNA oligonucleotides for 24 hours
  and then treated for 24 hours with 17β-estradiol (E2 - 10 nM). The loading control
  was done by evaluating vinculin expression in the same filter. Panels show representative
  blots. Densitometric and statistical analyses are reported in . (C) Western blot
  of presenilin 2 (pS2), and cathepsin D (CatD) in MCF-7 and Y537S cells treated with
  lometrexol (LMX 1 µM) for 48 hours. The loading control was done by evaluating vinculin
  expression in the same filter. Panels show representative blots. Densitometric and
  statistical analyses are reported in . (D) Estrogen response element promoter activity
  in MCF-7 ERE-NLuc cells pre-treated with fulvestrant (ICI182,780 - ICI 100 nM) or
  lometrexol (LMX 1 µM) for 48 hours and then treated with 17β-estradiol (E2 10 nM)
  for additional 24 hours. The experiments were performed three times in quintuplicate.
  Significant differences were calculated with the Anova test. **** (p-value < 0.0001)
  indicates significant differences with respect to untreated (i.e., -) sample. °°°°
  (p-value < 0.0001) indicates significant differences with respect to E2 treated
  sample. ^^^^ (p-value < 0.0001) indicates significant differences with respect to
  LMX treated sample. Western blot (E) and relative densitometric analyses (E’) of
  ERα and ERα S118 phosphorylation expression levels in MCF-7 cells pre-treated with
  lometrexol (LMX 1 µM) for 48 hours and then treated for 30 min with 17β-estradiol
  (E2 -10 nM). The loading control was done by evaluating vinculin expression in the
  same filter. Panels show representative blots of 4 independent experiments. Significant
  differences with respect to - sample are calculated by Student t-test and indicated
  by * p-value < 0.05. (F) Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay in MCF-7 cells
  treated with 17β-estradiol (E2 10 nM – 24 hours) after 48 hours pre-treatment with
  lometrexol (LMX 1 µM). The experiments have been performed twice in duplicate. Significant
  differences were calculated with the Anova test. **** (p-value < 0.0001) indicates
  significant differences with respect to untreated (i.e., -) sample. °°°° (p-value
  < 0.0001) indicates significant differences with respect to E2 treated sample. ^^^^
  (p-value < 0.0001) indicates significant differences with respect to LMX treated
  sample. (G) Real-time growth curves in MCF-7 cells treated with lometrexol (LMX
  1 µM) in the absence and the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2 10 nM). The graphs show
  the normalized cell index (i.e., cell number), which is detected with the xCelligence
  DP device and calculated at each time point with respect to the control sample.
  Each sample was measured in quadruplicate. For details, please see the material
  and methods section.
