caption: Alternative unfolding pathways of S6-α-S8 core in pulling simulations. (a)
  Pathways were determined by the detachment sequence of secondary structure units.
  Synchronized unfolding of two elements is marked by hyphenation and enclosing them
  in one cell. H4 labels both the H4 and H4b helices since they always unfold at the
  same time. (b) Summary of the pathway frequencies of the first stage of the S6-α-S8
  core unfolding. Helix H6 unfolds last in all outlier pathways. (c) Summary of the
  pathway frequencies of the second stage of the S6-α-S8 core. (d) Unfolding force
  distribution of secondary structural elements S6 and H6.
