caption: Function, pathway, and disease enrichment analysis of core genes. (A) Bubble
  plot of GO function enrichment for core genes. (BP, Biological Process; CC, Cellular
  Components; MF, Molecular Function). (B) Circle plot of GO functional enrichment.
  (C) Bubble map of KEGG pathway enrichment for core genes. (D) Circle plot of KEGG
  enrichment analysis. (E) Bubble plot of DO enrichment for core genes. (F) Circle
  plot of DO enrichment analysis. The size of bubbles in the bubble plot represents
  the number of core genes in the corresponding pathway. The color of the bubbles
  represents the adjusted p-value. The circle plot illustrates certain core genes
  corresponding to the GO/KEGG terminology or disease. LogFC represents the expression
  level of gene.
