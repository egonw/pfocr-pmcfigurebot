caption: '2-DG protects against cachexic-associated muscle wasting by inhibiting USP
  and ALP pathway activation. (A) Images showing the morphological changes in the
  muscles of the three groups using H&E staining. Scale bar: 100 µm. Average size
  of muscle fiber cross-sectional area in the three groups. Representative Masson’s
  trichrome staining of paraffin sections from muscle fibers of different groups of
  mice is shown. Scale bar: 100 µm. Using ImageJ, the collagen volume fraction (CVF)
  was plotted in a bar graph. The glycogen content was determined by periodic acid–Schiff
  (PAS) staining. Scale bar: 50 µm. In the histogram, the optical density (OD) of
  PAS staining is shown. (B) Gastrocnemius myosin heavy-chain (MHC) expression was
  examined by immunofluorescence staining. Scale bar: 50 µm. MHC, green; DAPI, blue.
  The bar graph shows the mean gray value of different groups. Antibodies against
  the fast myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) were used to stain gastrocnemius sections. Nuclei
  were detected using DAPI. Laminin and DAPI antibodies were used to stain gastrocnemius
  sections. Centrally nucleated fibers are indicated by red arrows. DAPI-labeled nuclei
  are indicated by white arrows. In the histogram, the number of centrally nucleated
  fibers is expressed as a percentage of the total number of fibers. (C) Western blot
  evaluated the MHC, atrogin-1, MuRF-1, myostatin, p-STAT3, STAT3, p62, and LC3 expression
  in the three groups (mean ± SD, n = 10). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
  denotes the NC group versus the cachexia group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p <
  0.001 denotes the cachexia group versus the cachexia+2-DG group. (D) Total RNA was
  extracted from the gastrocnemius of the three groups, and the expression levels
  of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 were evaluated using RT-PCR. Data are expressed as the mean
  ± SD, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, n = 10. n.s. means not significant.'
