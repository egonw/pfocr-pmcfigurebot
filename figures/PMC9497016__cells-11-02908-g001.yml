caption: Neuroinflammatory response mediated by inflammatory cells and its impact
  on dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease (PD). DAMPs released by dying neurons
  and CCL2, a proinflammatory mediator, released by astrocytes or by misfolded or
  aggregated proteins (such as α-syn) trigger the initiation of an inflammatory response.
  Microglia and astrocytes change their morphology and gene expression and secrete
  several pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators to restore homeostasis. Canonically,
  activated microglia can be polarized into M1 (mainly proinflammatory cytokines promoting
  inflammation) or M2 phenotype (especially anti-inflammatory mediators stimulating
  repair and regeneration, which can be divided into M2a, M2b, or M2c). Similarly,
  reactive astrocytes acquire A1 and A2 phenotypes. In PD, the dysregulated cytokine
  release and the vast abundance of M1 and A1 phenotypes contribute to neurotoxicity
  and neurodegeneration. M1 phenotype is favorably adopted when DAMPs and CCL2 are
  released. In astrocytes, the presence of α-syn inclusions leads to the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines. However, this phenotypic and morphological characterization
  of inflammatory cells was established according to in vitro studies. NRLP3 (inflammasome)
  can detect aggregated substances (fibrillar α-Syn in microglia or detected by TLR2
  receptors) or IL-1β released by microglia, activating the NF-kB pathway and NLRP3
  inflammasome, producing proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, which
  ultimately leads to pyroptosis. Thereby, in in vivo conditions, microglia and astrocytes
  exhibit wide heterogeneity. Despite the insufficient techniques to precisely identify
  the participant cells in inflammatory events in PD, their response is affected by
  the brain region, morphology, phenotype, and function. The inflammatory response
  occurring in PD mediated by the release of cytokine growth factors and genetic dysregulation
  produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), leading to neurodegeneration
  of dopaminergic neurons. (Figure generated using BioRender.com (accessed on 1 June
