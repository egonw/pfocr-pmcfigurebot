caption: The effects of ellagic acid on the expression of genes related to the stress
  response in worms exposed to UV radiation. (A) The expression of the daf-16, sod-3,
  and hsf-1 genes was measured using qPCR, n > 500. (B) The expression of small heat
  shock protein genes (hsp-16.1, hsp-16.2, hsp-16.49, and hsp-12.6) was determined
  with qPCR, n > 500. The data are shown as the mean Â± SD. p < 0.01 (**).
