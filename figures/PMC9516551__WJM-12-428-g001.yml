caption: Physiology of interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 has regulatory role in various physiological
  processes such as inflammation, immunity and reproduction. IL-6 is induced by viruses
  and UV, etc., and is released by macrophages, monocytes and stromal cells under
  normal physiological conditions, and under pathophysiological conditions, it is
  induced by nuclear factor-ÎºB, prostaglandin E2, hypoxia and released by tumor-infiltrating
  immune cells and tumor cells, etc. IL-6 can activate the STAT3 signaling pathway
  either by the classical pathway or trans-signaling pathway. Activation of STAT3
  can upregulate a variety of genes and may have an important role in tumor formation.
