caption: NSA or Mdivi-1 attenuated synaptic damages in the hippocampus of SAE mice.
  A Representative microphotograph of Golgi-Cox staining in the hippocampal sections.
  Magnification images from red box in upper panels. Scale bar = 10 μm. B Quantification
  of dendritic spine density of neurons in the hippocampus (n = 3 mice/group, three
  images per mouse). C Representative TEM images indicating the synapses in the longitudinal
  cross-section of an axon (indicated by red arrows). Magnification 3,000 ×. Scale
  bar = 2 μm. D Synaptic counts in the hippocampus. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM
  (n = 3 mice/group, three images per mouse). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus the indicated
  groups
