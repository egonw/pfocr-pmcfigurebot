figure_title: Succinate reverses the inflammatory response and the metabolic modifications
  induced by influenza virus
caption: 'Bronchial epithelial (BEAS‐2B) cells were infected or not with influenza
  A/Scotland/20/74 (H3N2) virus (IAV) at MOI = 1 for 4 h and treated or not with succinate
  (Suc; 4 mg/ml/24.7 mM) for 20 h. AVolcano‐plot showing the most significantly regulated
  canonical pathways determined by microarray analysis compared with mock‐treated
  cells. Each dot represents a specific canonical pathway as determined by GSEA. Pathway
  representations result from the magnitude of regulation (z‐score, x‐axis) and significance
  (−log10 adjusted P‐value, y‐axis). The dashed horizontal line indicates the statistical
  significance threshold (P ≤ 0.01 after adjustment with the Bonferroni correction).
  The two vertical dashed lines show the z‐score threshold (−2: repressed; 2: induced).
  Colored spots characterize the most highly regulated canonical pathways endowed
  with statistical significance.BRepresentative inflammatory protein‐array blots obtained
  from the supernatants of control‐ or IAV‐infected‐ or IAV‐infected and succinate‐treated
  cells. The table on the right side indicates the 8 most regulated mediators by succinate.CQuantification
  by ELISA of IL‐6, IL‐8, IP‐10, and RANTES in the supernatants of cells infected
  or not by IAV and treated or not with succinate.D, EPanels show the basal replotted
  ECAR and OCR (D), and glycolytic capacity (ECAR max) and maximal respiration (OCR
  max) (E) in cells infected with IAV and treated (green symbols) or not (pink symbols)
  with succinate. Data were normalized with respect to mock‐infected, untreated cells
  (orange symbols), and were also normalized for DNA content.Data information: Data
  are the mean ± SEM of 6 (panel C) or 4 (panels A, D, E) independent experiments.
  Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post‐test
  (C, D, E) (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01) and ANOVA with Holm–Sidak’s posttest (A).'
