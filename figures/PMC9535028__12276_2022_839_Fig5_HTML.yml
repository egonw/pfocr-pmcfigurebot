figure_title: β-catenin/Oct4 regulates the expression of antiapoptotic molecules
caption: 'a The mRNA and protein levels of bFGF, survivin, Bcl2, Bax (a–c), and cleaved
  caspase-3 (b, c) in the PBMSCs treated with vehicle, oeβ-catenin, shβ-catenin, or
  oeβ-catenin plus shβ-catenin were evaluated using qRT‒PCR (a) and western blotting
  (b, c). d–f The mRNA and protein levels of these molecules from PBMSCs treated with
  vehicle, oeOct4, shOct4, or oeOct4 plus shOct4 were also detected using qRT‒PCR
  (d) and western blotting (e, f). All graphical data are shown as the means ± SEMs.
  P < 0.05: * vs. the vehicle group, # vs. the oeβ-catenin group, Δ vs. the shβ-catenin
  group, n = 10 for each group.'
article_title: β-Catenin promotes long-term survival and angiogenesis of peripheral
  blood mesenchymal stem cells via the Oct4 signaling pathway.
