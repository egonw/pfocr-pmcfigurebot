caption: 'cGGNBP2‐184aa regulates STAT3 phosphorylation to activate JAK‐STAT signaling.
  (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed the significantly
  affected signaling pathway on cGGNBP2‐184aa overexpression in RBE cells. (B, C)
  Western blotting analysis showed the phosphorylation status of STAT3Tyr705 and STAT3Ser727
  in the indicated cells. (D, E) Subcellular fractionation assays revealed the distribution
  of phosphorylated STAT3Tyr705 and phosphorylated STAT3Ser727 in the indicated cells.
  GAPDH and H3 were used as positive controls in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively.
  (F) Luciferase assays determined the activity of STAT3 response elements in the
  indicated cells. (G) qRT‐PCR analysis for the relative mRNA expression of STAT3
  target genes in the indicated cells. (H) Left: cell counting kit‐8 (CCK8) assays
  showed cell proliferation capacity of the indicated cells cotransfected with STAT3
  siRNA or treated with C188‐9 (20 μM) or BP‐1‐102 (20 μM). Right: Cell proliferation
  capacity of the indicated cells cotransfected with wild‐type or Tyr705‐mutated STAT3
  vectors. (I) The migration and invasion capacity were examined in the indicated
  cells. (J) Wound healing assays were performed in the indicated cells. C188‐9 and
  BP‐1‐102 were small molecular inhibitor of STAT3. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p <
  0.001; ###p < 0.001 versus OE‐cGGNBP2+siRNA‐NC or cGGNBP2 shRNA; ns, not significant
  versus cGGNBP2 shRNA'
