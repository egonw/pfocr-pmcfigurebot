caption: 'Paeoniflorin ameliorated HPRL-induced osteoblast differentiation inhibition
  in vitro. (a) The structure of PF. (b) A CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate cell
  viability. (c) Representative images of ALP and ARS staining. (d) The ALP-positive
  cells in each group were quantified. (e) Quantification of ARS-stained cells and
  mineral nodules. n = 3; scale bar = 200 μm; ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗ vs the 0 ng/ml group;
  &&P < 0.01, &vs the NC group; ##P < 0.01, # vs the PC group.'
