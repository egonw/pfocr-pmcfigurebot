caption: Protein complex LIS1/CLIP170 regulates SACC-LM cell proliferation and apoptosis
  through the Cdc42 pathway. (A) The protein level of LIS1 was detected by western
  blotting and statistically analyzed. (B) The proliferation of tumor cells treated
  with ML141 (Cdc42 inhibitor) was assessed by CCK-8 assay. (C) Cells were transfected
  with LIS1 or CLIP170. Immunoprecipitation was then performed to examine the interaction
  between LIS1 and endogenous CLIP170. (D) SACC-LM cells were transfected with vector
  or LIS1 and then transfected with si-control or si-CLIP170. The proliferation of
  tumor cells with or without the treatment of ML141 was assessed by CCK-8 assay.
  (E) TUNEL assays were performed to examine cell apoptosis. (F) Quantitative statistical
  analysis of TUNEL assay results. (G) Cyclin D1 and BCL2 protein expression was assessed
  via western blotting in SACC-LM cells. (H) Quantitative analysis of the protein
  level in G. Mean Â± SEM; *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. LIS1, lissencephaly 1;
  CLIP170, cytoplasmic linker protein 170; SACC, salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma;
  Cdc42, cell division control protein 42 homolog; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; si-,
  small interfering RNA; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end
  labeling; IP, immunoprecipitation.
