caption: CLPTM1L is crucial for efficient utilization of GlcN-PI by the GPI biosynthetic
  pathway in the ER lumen. (A) Flow cytometry analysis of WT and CLPTM1L-KO HEK293
  cells stably expressing CLPTM1L-mEGFP controlled by a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible
  Tet-On system (Left) stained with anti-CD59 mAb (Center). CLPTM1L-mEGFP expression
  is induced by 1 µg/mL of Dox. (B) HPTLC analysis of GPI intermediates from cells
  metabolically labeled with [3H]Man for 1 h. Representative of two biological repeats.
  (C) Flow cytometry analysis of WT, DPM1-KO, MPDU1-KO, and CLPTM1L-KO HEK293 cells
  stained with anti–α-dystroglycan (α-DG) mAb. DPM1 and MPDU1 are essential for biosynthesis
  and utilization of DPM, respectively. (D and E) HPTLC analysis of GlcN-PI (D) or
  GlcN-(acyl)-PI (E) from cells metabolically labeled with [3H]inositol for 10 h.
  (F) Flow cytometry analysis of PIGW-KO, PIGL-KO, and PIGW-CLPTM1L-DKO HEK293 cells
  stably expressing empty vector (Vec) or CLPTM1L stained with anti-CD59 mAb. Data
  shown in Right panels of A, C, and D–F are mean ± SD of three (A, C, E, and F) or
  two (D) independent biological repeats. In A, P value is from t test (unpaired and
  two-tailed). In E and F, P values are from one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test
  for multiple comparisons.
