caption: Impact of KrasWT and KrasG12D mutation on expression levels of alt-EJ components.
  (A) Protein expression of Polθ, PARP1, Lig3, Mre11, Lig4, Ku80, and Ku70 in cell
  extracts isolated from transduced Panc02 and BxPC3 cells, and their respective quantification,
  are presented. Representative immunoblots from three independent experiments are
  shown. (B) Bar graphs show protein expression levels relative to GAPDH in Panc02
  and BxPC3 determined by the means of densitometry of three independent experiments
  (mean ± SD; * p < 0.05 is considered as significant; Student’s t−test). The uncropped
  blots and molecular weight markers are shown in . (C,D) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
  plots for the Reactome NHEJ and alt-EJ in Panc02 and BxPC3 cells are shown. The
  heatmap on the right side of each panel visualizes the genes contributing the most
  to the enriched pathway. The green curve corresponds to the enrichment score (ES)
  curve, the running sum of the weighted enrichment score in GSEA. p values are reported
  within each graph (Panc02 control, n = 2; Panc02 KrasMT, n = 3; BxPC3 control, n
  = 3; BxPC3 KrasMT, n = 3).
