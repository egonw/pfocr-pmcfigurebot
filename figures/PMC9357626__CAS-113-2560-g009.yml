caption: The miR‐148a‐3p/HDAC5 axis is involved in the EMT pathway by modulating vimentin.
  A‐D, The relationship of HDAC5 with vimentin, CDH1, CDH2, and TWIST1 in TCGA database.
  E, The mRNA levels of four genes in SW480 cells after knockdown of HDAC5 were detected
  by qPCR. F, The mRNA levels of the four genes in HCT116 cells after overexpression
  of HDAC5 were detected by qPCR. G, The relative expression levels of four genes
  in SW480 cells after transfection with miR‐148a‐3p mimic were detected by qPCR.
  H, The relative expression levels of four genes in HCT116 cells after transfection
  with miR‐148a‐3p inhibitor were detected by qPCR. I, After cotransfection with HDAC5
  siRNA and miR‐148a‐3p inhibitor in SW480 cells, the expression level of vimentin
  was detected by qRT‐PCR and Western blot (WB). J, HCT116 cells were cotransfected
  with the HDAC5 overexpression plasmid and miR‐148a‐3p mimic, and the expression
  level of vimentin was detected by qRT‐PCR and WB
