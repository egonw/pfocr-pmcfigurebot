figure_title: Stimulation of TLR7 activates NFκB signaling in keratinocytes
caption: '(A) In TLR7-overexpressing HaCaT keratinocytes, top-ranked enriched KEGG
  terms in genes that were differentially regulated between R848 and control revealed
  gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The NFκB signaling pathway was highlighted
  in red box. (B) In TLR7-overexpressing HaCaT keratinocytes, GSEA on RNA-sequencing
  data between R848 and control shows enrichment for the NFκB signaling pathway in
  the R848 group. Significance was calculated by permutation test. (C) Immunoblot
  analysis of p-p65, total p65 and TLR7 in cell lysates from TLR7-overexpressing primary
  human keratinocytes treated with R848 for 15 min. p-p65 protein levels were analyzed
  relative to total p65. GAPDH is the loading control. Data (C) are representative
  of at least three independent experiments. TLR7 OE, TLR7-overexpression. (D) The
  mRNA expression levels of NFκB family of transcription factors (NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA,
  and RELB) in TLR7-overexpressing primary human keratinocytes treated with R848 for
  12 h (from three replicates). (E) Immunostaining of p-p65 in skin sections from
  Scr siRNA and Tlr7 siRNA mice. Epi, epidermis. Der, dermis. Scale bar: 200 µm. Scr
  siRNA, scrambled siRNA. (F) Quantification of relative fluorescence intensity for
  p-p65 in epidermis (n = 6). All results are representative of at least three independent
  experiments. Data represent the mean ± SEM. ** P < 0.01. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s
  post hoc test (F) or two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (D) was used.'
