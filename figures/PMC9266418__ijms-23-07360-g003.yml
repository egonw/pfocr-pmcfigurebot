caption: The transcription levels of (A) estrogen receptor α (ESR1), (B) estrogen
  receptor ß (ESR2), and (C) progesterone receptor (PGR) in the mares’ endometria
  in follicular (FLP; n = 50) or mid-luteal (MLP; n = 50) phases of the estrous cycle.
  The endometrial samples were classified as Kenney and Doig’s category I (n = 20),
  IIa (n = 30), IIb (n = 30), or III (n = 20). Category I included C group (n = 20)
  samples; category IIa included types E IN (n = 5), E ID (n = 10), E AN (n = 12),
  and E AD (n = 3) samples; category IIb included types E IN (n = 11), E ID (n = 5),
  E AN (n = 5), and E AD (n = 9) samples; and category III included types E IN (n
  = 4), E ID (n = 5), E AN (n = 3), and E AD (n = 8) samples. Boxes represent lower
  quartile, median, and upper quartile, whereas whiskers represent minimum and maximum
  values. The dashed line separates the categories of unaffected and affected endometria.
  Lowercase letters indicate differences between categories of endometrosis for p
  < 0.05. Asterisks indicate differences between phases of estrous cycle (* p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.0001).
