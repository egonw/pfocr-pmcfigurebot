caption: The abnormality of genes contributes to the formation of radiation resistance
  in CSCs. (A) High expression of Bim‐1, RSK4, CD133, and JAK2 induces cancer cells
  resistance to radiation. (B) Activation of the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway not
  only enhances DNA damage repair in CSCs but also promotes the EMT, which induces
  radioresistance. (C) EGFR/Stat3/c‐Myc/p27 pathway contributes to the cell quiescence
  and lead to abnormal cell cycle in cancer. (D) TGF‐β secreted by resident fibroblasts
  promotes the EMT of CSCs, which may decrease radiosensitivity

  potential implications for cancer treatment.
