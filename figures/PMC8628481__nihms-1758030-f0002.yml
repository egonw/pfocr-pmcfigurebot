caption: Architecture and scheme of the hierarchically-organized BCP@NEA electrochemical
  SERS sensor. (A) Phenazine biosynthetic pathway in P. aeruginosa. PCA, phenazine-1-carboxylic
  acid; 1-OHP, 1-hydroxyphenazine; 5-MCA, 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid; PCN,
  phenazine-1-carboxamide; PYO, pyocyanin. Phenazine-modifying genes for the conversion
  reactions are labelled along with arrows., â€“ (B) Schematic illustration of the electrochemical
  SERS sensor with BCP gate closed at pH 7.0. (C) Schematic illustration of the electrochemical
  SERS sensor with BCP gate open at pH 4.5 for the permselective transport and detection
  of negatively charged molecules by square wave voltammetry and SERS.
