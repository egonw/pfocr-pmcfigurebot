caption: Schematic representation of IL-6-signaling pathways in CRC. (A) Classical
  signaling pathway, IL-6, binds to the membrane-bound IL-6R (mIL-6R), which then
  transmits the signal by recruiting and homodimerizing two glycoprotein 130 (gp130)
  subunits. (B) Cells which are not able to secrete mIL-6R, react to IL-6 through
  the alternative pathway, which is referred as the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway.
  In this pathway, a soluble receptor of IL-6 (sIL-6R) is released by alternative
  splicing or by A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) protease-mediated receptor
  shedding from the membrane. (C) The binding of the IL-6/mIL-6R or IL-6/sIL-6R complex
  to gp130 on tumor cells activates Janus kinases (JAKs) and STAT3 signaling and promotes
  tumor cell proliferation.
