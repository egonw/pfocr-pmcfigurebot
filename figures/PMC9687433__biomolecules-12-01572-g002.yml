caption: Hp-TGM1 functions similarly to mammalian TGFβ despite lack of homologies
  between proteins. Hp-TGM1 binds to mammalian TGFβ I and II type receptors; induces
  Smad 2/3 phosphorylation with lack in Akt and p38 signal pathway activation in murine
  splenocytes; induces generation of mice and human Foxp3+ Treg cells; increases Foxp3
  and CD39 expression in induced Treg same as mammalian TGFβ.
