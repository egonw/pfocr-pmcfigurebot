caption: Effects of BSDF administration on the liver transcriptome in HFD-induced
  obese mice. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis
  using DEGs between t the NCD, HFD, and HFD-BSDF groups. n = 5 per group. (B) Relative
  mRNA expression of important genes on the PPAR signaling pathway in liver. n = 8
  per group. Data presented as mean Â± SEM, n = 8. a, b, c means in the same bar without
  a common letter differ at p < 0.05. NCD, normal control diet; HFD, high-fat diet;
  HFD-BSDF, high-fat diet supplemented with 6% BSDF freeze-dried powder.
article_title: Bamboo shoot dietary fiber alleviates gut microbiota dysbiosis and
  modulates liver fatty acid metabolism in mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity.
