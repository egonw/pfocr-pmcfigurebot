caption: 'MRPL9 is highly expressed in PTC. (A) The expression level of MRPL9 in thyroid
  cancer was analyzed by TCGA database. (B) The GEPIA2 website (http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#index,
  accessed on 22 March 2022) analyzed the effect of MRPL9 on the survival and prognosis
  of patients with thyroid cancer. (C) Representative images of MRPL9 immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) of normal PTC tissue (top) and PTC tissue (bottom) (IHC score: 10, scar bar
  = 100 µm). (D) MRPL9 immunohistochemical score statistics of PTC group (n = 26)
  and normal group (n = 26) (Each dot represents a patient’s normal thyroid tissue,
  and each triangle represents a patient’s PTC tissue). (E) Representative Western
  blot of MRPL9 protein in 26 pairs of PTC tissues and normal tissues. (F) Western
  blot results were quantified and normalized to Actin (n = 3). (G) RT-qPCR analysis
  examined the expression level of MRPL9 in Nthy-ori 3.1, TPC-1, K1, BCPAP cell lines
  (n = 3). (H) Western blot detection of MRPL9 protein expression levels in Nthy-ori
  3.1, TPC-1, K1, and BCPAP cell lines. (I) Western blot results were quantified and
  normalized to Actin (n = 3). Measurement data (mean ± standard deviation) between
  two groups were compared by paired t test, and multiple groups were compared by
  one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test. “*” represents
  p ≤ 0.05, “**” represents p ≤ 0.01.'
