caption: Regulation of eG4 dynamics and cancer treatment. Cancer cells grow and divide
  indefinitely in vivo, leading to tumor growth and disease progression. There are
  two potential ways to target G4 in cancer treatment. The first method is to use
  G4-stabilizing ligands to prevent the unfolding of the proto-oncogene promoter eG4s,
  thereby reducing the expression of proto-oncogenes in cancer cells (yellow). The
  second method is to kill cancer cells by combining DSBs caused by G4-stabilizing
  ligands with inhibition of the HR or NHEJ pathway (magenta)
