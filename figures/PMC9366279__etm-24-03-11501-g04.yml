caption: MiR-374a-5p exerts its function in LPS-treated HPMVECs by regulating the
  ZEB1-mediated p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Expression levels of p-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK,
  p-JNK, JNK, p-ERK, ERK were analyzed by western blotting. The representative blots
  and quantitated results of p-p38/p38 ratio, p-JNK/JNK ratio, and p-ERK/ERK ratio
  are shown in HPMVECs transfected with miR-374a-5p mimic and ZEB1 after treatment
  of LPS. Results represent the means Â± SD of 3 independent experiments. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. MiR-374a-5p, microRNA-374a-5p; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  HPMVECs, human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells; ZEB1, zinc finger E-box
  binding homeobox 1; p-, phosphorylated.
