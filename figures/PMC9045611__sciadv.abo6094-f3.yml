figure_title: Widespread alteration of transcriptome and metabolism triggered by cocultivation
  of A. nidulans carrying the veA1 allele with E. dendrobii
caption: '(A) Expression levels of the 64 core biosynthetic genes in eight chromosomes
  of A. nidulans. Red, green, and gray color represent the genes that are up-regulated,
  down-regulated, and not regulated significantly under cocultivation condition, respectively.
  (B) The differential expressions of BGCs are indicated by heatmap during cocultivation.
  Their corresponding products referring to the published data are labeled on the
  right. Unknown: The biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated yet. (C) Additional
  SMs in A. nidulans are activated under cocultivation condition.'

  alteration requiring the partial loss-of-function VeA1 protein.
