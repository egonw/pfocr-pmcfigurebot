caption: EMT is correlated with high expression of ASIC1a and drug resistance of HCC.
  (A) MTT analysis of the cell viability. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3.
  (B) Representative images of the colony formation assay in HCC cells. The percentage
  of colony formation was calculated. Data are presented as mean ±SD, n = 3. **p <
  0.01 and ***p < 0.001 all versus H or B therapy group. (C) Western blotting analysis
  of EMT marker molecule protein levels in HCC cells. Data were expressed as the mean
  ± SD, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 all versus H group. (D) Invasion
  abilities of different group cells were determined by transwell invasion assays.
  Representative images were taken at ×200 magnification. Data were expressed as the
  mean ± SD, n = 3. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 all versus H group. (E) Migration abilities
  of different group cells were examined by wound‐healing assays. Representative images
  were taken at ×100 magnification. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD, n = 3. *p
  < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.01 all versus 0 h group
