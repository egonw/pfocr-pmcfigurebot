caption: LncRNA HAR1A regulated NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis via the STAT3
  signaling pathway. (a) GSEA revealed that the IL-6-JAK-STAT3 pathway was associated
  with lncRNA HAR1A in NSCLC cell lines. (b) Western blot was used to detect expression
  and phosphorylation levels of STAT3 under the influence of the knockdown or overexpression
  of lncRNA HAR1A. (c) shCtrl and shHAR1A cells and controls were treated with or
  without STAT3 inhibitor, Stattic. Western blot was performed to examine the levels
  of the indicated proteins. (d,e) Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry.
  (f) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK8. The experiments were performed in triplicate,
  and data were calculated from three independent experiments using statistical analysis.
