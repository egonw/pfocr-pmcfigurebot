caption: Anti-inflammatory effects of Cudrania tricuspidata fruit extracts. (a) Cudrania
  tricuspidata (CT) fruit was extracted using 99% ethanol, room temperature water
  or hot water (top panel). Extraction yield of CT fruit (bottom panel). (b) The indicated
  concentration of extract from CT fruit was mixed with assay buffer and analyzed
  for the free radical-scavenging ability. (c) RAW 264.7 cells were treated with the
  indicated amount of extract for 24 h, and the MTT assay was performed. Results are
  presented as a percentage of the untreated control and represent the mean ± SEM.
  (d) RAW 264.7 cells were treated with the indicated amount of extract with or without
  0.1 μg/ml of LPS for 24 h. The expression levels of mRNAs were analyzed using RT-PCR.
  β-Actin was detected as a control. Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation
  (SD). ∗P < 0.05 vs. control.
