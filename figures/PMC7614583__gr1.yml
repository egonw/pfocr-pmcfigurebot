caption: Integrative analysis reveals the activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and glycolysis in pulmonary fibrosis. (A) Scatter plot showing
  gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) from 6 categories (development, immune, metabolism,
  pathway, proliferation, and signaling). The sizes of circles represent the −Log10
  of the adjusted P values and the colors of circles represent the normalized enrichment
  score (NES). (B, C) Fold change in the mRNA levels of EMT markers in the lungs from
  saline-treated (Control) or bleomycin-challenged mice (BLM) at day 7 (B) or day
  21 (C) post instillation. Actb (β-actin) -normalized mRNA levels in the control
  group were used to set the baseline value at unity. Data are expressed as mean ± s.d.∗Q < 0.05,
  ∗∗Q < 0.01, by two sample Mann–Whitney U test, multiple comparisons using false
  discovery rate (Q) with the method of two-stage step-up (Benjamini, Krieger and
  Yekutieli).
