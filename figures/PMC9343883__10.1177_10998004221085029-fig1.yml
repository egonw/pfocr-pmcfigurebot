caption: Boxplots of metabolic pathway scores (i.e., summed z-scores of pathway metabolites)
  by average steps-per-day categories (low <10,000; medium = 10,000â€“15,000; high >15,000).
  A) Aminoacyl t-RNA biosynthesis metabolic pathway (asparagine, phenylalanine, methionine,
  valine, tryptophan, and tyrosine metabolites). B) Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan
  metabolic pathway (phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolites). C) Glycine, serine,
  and threonine metabolic pathway (betaine, 3-phosphoglyceric acid, glyceric acid,
  and glyoxylic acid metabolites). D) Galactose metabolic pathway (galactose and myoinositol
  metabolites). The Phenylalanine metabolic pathway shared the same metabolites with
  the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolic pathway.
