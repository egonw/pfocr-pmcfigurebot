figure_title: POU6F1 inactivates HIF1A signaling pathway and transcriptionally regulates
  ENO1, PDK1, and PRKCB expression
caption: A Volcano plot showing differential expression genes (DEGs) in A549 cells
  stably transfected with POU6F1 compared with empty vector (mock). B Human KEGG pathway
  analysis of DEGs indicating participated pathways in A549 cells stably transfected
  with POU6F1 relative to mock. C Venn diagram revealing comprehensive analysis of
  genes, that were involved with the HIF1A signaling pathway and associated with LUAD
  progression in various status of death, tumor stage, and metastasis. D Western blotting
  assay showing the expression of HIF1A, ENO1, ENO2, GAPDH, PDK1, and PRKCB in A549
  and NCI-H1299 cells stably transfected with mock or POU6F1. E Real-time qRT-PCR
  assay indicating the expression of HIF1A, ENO1, PDK1, and PRKCB in A549 cells stably
  transfected with mock or POU6F1. F Dual-luciferase assay indicating relative activity
  of HIF1A promoter in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells stably transfected with mock or POU6F1,
  and those treated with DMSO or ML228 (1.0 μmol/l). G Western blotting assay showing
  the expression of HIF1A in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells stably transfected with mock
  or POU6F1, and those treated with DMSO or MG132 (5 μmol/l) for 6 h. H Dual-luciferase
  assay showing relative activity of ENO1, PDK1, and PRKCB promoter in A549 and NCI-H1299
  cells transfected with mock or POU6F1. I ChIP and qPCR assays indicating relative
  POU6F1 enrichment on ENO1, PDK1, and PRKCB promoter in A549 cells stably transfected
  with mock or POU6F1. Student t-test and ANOVA compared the difference in E, F and
  H, I. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
