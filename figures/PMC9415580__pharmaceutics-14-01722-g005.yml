caption: 'Proposed mechanisms for Doxil® and Abraxane® tumor accumulation. After being
  injected intravenously, the pegylated liposomes of doxorubicin (DOX—orange) formulation
  may reach the tumor through passive targeting/enhanced permeation-retention (EPR)
  effect (1), since this site presents irregular vascular architecture with fenestrated
  capillaries and impaired lymphatic drainage. The presence of polyethylene glycol
  (PEG) in Doxil® corona provides a hydration layer that repels opsonins from the
  liposome and avoids phagocytosis by cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES),
  such as macrophages (2). DOX may be released through three distinct mechanisms:
  secretion of phospholipases (3) or ammonia (4) by tumor cells or endocytosis followed
  by lysosomal processing (5). Abraxane® presents other peculiarities: it probably
  dissociates into smaller complexes composed of albumin and paclitaxel (PTX; blue)
  (6). These structures, such as Doxil®, may accumulate in tumor microenvironment,
  by EPR effect (1), transcytosis through binding receptors (glycoprotein 60—gp60)
  in endothelial cells (7), and interaction with secreted protein acidic and rich
  in cysteine (SPARC—yellow) (8). Albumin may be endocytosed through the caveolin-1
  pathway (9), followed by lysosomal processing with subsequent drug release (5).
