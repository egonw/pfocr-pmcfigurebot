caption: Sevoflurane activated the apoptotic pathway in 3 × Tg but not in wild-type
  mice. Cleaved caspase 3 and BAX/Bcl2 proteins were examined in the hippocampus and
  neocortex of wild-type and 3 × Tg mice. (a) No significant change in the cleaved
  caspase 3 was in line with a reduction in the BAX/Bcl2 ratio in wild-type mice.
  (b) Significant elevation of cleaved caspase 3 protein and BAX/Bcl2 ratio in 3 ×
  Tg mice. Bar graphs below show the quantification of Western blot. Data correspond
  to the mean ± SEM (n = 5–6) and represent the band densities that were normalized
  with the endogenous loading control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 in comparison to the
  control. Values were analyzed using the unpaired t-test.
