caption: METTL1 depletion reduced tRNA m7G modification, m7G tRNA expression, and
  oncogenic mRNA translation(A and B) m7G modification decreased in A549 lung cancer
  cells with METTL1 or WDR4 depletion. (C) The list of m7G-modified tRNAs in A549
  cells identified by TRAC-seq. (D) Representative images of cleavage scores of indicated
  tRNAs at m7G-modified sties. Decreased cleavage score was shown in the shMETTL1
  group, indicating the reduced m7G tRNA modification level in METTL1-depleted cells.
  (E) tRNA m7G modification level was decreased in METTL1-depleted A549 cells. (F)
  m7G-modified tRNAs expression levels were decreased in METTL1-depleted A549 cells
  compared to that of the non-m7G-modified tRNAs. (G) Relative expression profile
  of m7G-modified tRNAs based on TRAC-seq. The relative expression of each tRNA type
  was calculated from the combined expression of all of the tRNA genes belonging to
  the same tRNA type. (H) Northern blotting analyzed the expression levels of representative
  m7G-modified tRNAs and non-m7G-modified tRNAs in lung cancer cells upon METTL1 or
  WDR4 depletion. U6 snRNA was used as a loading control. (I) Overexpression of METTL1
  or WDR4 increased the expression level of m7G modification and m7G-modified tRNAs
  in lung cancer cells. (J) Polysome profiling of A549 cells with or without METTL1
  knockdown. (K) Translation efficiency (TE) of METTL1-depleted A549 cells was decreased
  by analyzing the puromycin intake in cells. Overexpression of wild-type METTL1 instead
  of catalytic inactive mutant METTL1 rescued translation deficiency of METTL1-depleted
  A549 cells. (L) Scatterplot of gene TE in A549 cells with or without METTL1 depletion.
  TE was calculated by dividing the RNC-mRNA sequencing signals to input mRNA sequencing
  signals. (M) Frequency of the m7G-related codons in TE up, TE down, and other genes
  (others) in METTL1 depletion cells. (N) m7G codon frequency of genes with the top
  25% TE was significantly higher than that of the genes with the bottom 25% TE in
  the NC group. (O) TEs of the identified TE down gene were significantly higher than
  that of the other and TE up genes in NC cells. (P) Gene ontology analysis of function
  enrichment in the biological process with TE down genes in METTL1 depletion cells.
  (Q) Pathway analysis with TE down genes in METTL1 depletion cells. (R and S) qRT-PCR
  and western blotting confirmed the TEs changes of the identified cell-cycle-related
  genes. (T) IHC confirmed the decreased expression of the identified TE down gene
  CCND3 in METTL1-depleted xenograft tumors sections. Data were presented as mean ± SD.
  Scale bars, 100 μm and 50 μm. (One-way ANOVA, Student’s t test, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p <
  0.001, compared to the shGFP group.)
