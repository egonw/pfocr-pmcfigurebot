caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of rab-like protein 6 signaling in hepatitis
  B-related hepatocellular carcinoma tumors. Genes are implicated in several disease
  potential disease processes including inflammation, cell division, Akt signaling,
  and more. Legend illustrates relationship between genes. See Figure 2 legend for
  identification of shapes. RABL6: RAB, member RAS oncogene family like 6; TP53: Tumor
  protein p53; E2F4: E2F transcription factor 4; FOXO1: Forkhead box O1; FOXM1: Forkhead
  box M1; MCM10: Mini-chromosome maintenance 10; BUB1: Mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine-protein
  kinase BUB1; TTK: TTK protein kinase; UBE2C: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C;
