caption: 'Analysis of tumor cell viability for silencing of miR-21 microRNA expression
  by siRNAs. Panel (A): CaSki cells not transfected (NT, lanes a–f), transfected with
  pSilencer 1.0-U6 empty vector plasmid (lanes from aa to cf), or transfected with
  pSIMIR21-5P plasmid (lanes from da to ff) were analyzed by white light microscopy
  (20×) during 5 days after transfection. Black arrows indicate the dead cells. Panel
  (B): Cellular viability was measured in CaSki cells transfected with pSilencer 1.0-U6
  or pSIMIR21-5P plasmids, respectively, using MTS assay. p values < 0.05 are indicated
  with an asterisk.'
