caption: Biological process and signaling pathway functional enrichment analysis of
  the candidate molecular targets for DM1. (A) The top 10 biological processes associated
  with the candidate molecular targets for DM1. (B) REAC signaling pathway enrichment
  analysis of the eight overrepresented signaling pathways using g:Profiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost
  (accessed on 29 August 2022). The purple bars represent the number of genes annotated
  in the category. GO, gene ontology; NGF, nerve growth factor; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; PI3K/AKT, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ protein kinase
  B; ECM, extracellular matrix; NTRK1 (TRKA), neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor
  type 1.
