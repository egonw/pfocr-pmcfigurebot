caption: The methylation status measuring sequence analyses of HIF-1α and LDH-A genes.
  (A) The methylation status measuring region of the HIF-1α gene. The abscissa indicates
  a part of the HIF-1α gene; ordinate denotes CG percentage; light blue shaded part
  shows the CpG island (CG percentage more than 50%, −336~+219, 555 bp); blue box
  represents the methylation status measuring region (234 bp (from −243 to −10), with
  18 CpG dinucleotides); and green five-pointed star represents the position of start
  codon (ATG). (B) The 234 bp sequence of methylation status measurement in the HIF-1α
  gene. The 18 CpG dinucleotides are indicated in yellow shading and the bold letters,
  and the start codon is shadowed in green and bold. The transcription factor binding
  sites (TFBSs) are marked with dashed underlines, and their corresponding transcription
  factors (SOX10, Sox17, Sox6, VDR, ETS1, ZNF354C, GATA2, and GATA3) are near the
  corresponding TFBSs. (C) The methylation status measuring region of the LDH-A gene.
  Its illustration is the same as A except that the abscissa indicates a part of the
  LDH-A gene; the light blue shaded part shows the sequence with a CG percentage more
  than 40% (−653~−535, 119 bp); and the blue box represents the methylation status
  measuring region (243 bp (from −753 to −511), with 7 CpG dinucleotides). (D) The
  243 bp sequence of methylation status measurement in the LDH-A gene. Its 7 CpG dinucleotides
  are indicated in yellow shading. TFBSs are shown with dashed underlines, and their
  corresponding transcription factors (SPl1, ZNF354C, ETS1, ARNT::HIF1A (HIF-1), Arnt,
  Mycn, TFE3, Creb312, USF1, and USF2) are near them.
