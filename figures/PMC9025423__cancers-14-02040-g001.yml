caption: 'The Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway specializes in the repair of
  DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). The FA pathway is activated in response to ICL
  formation. ICLs are recognized by the FANCM protein, which subsequently recruits
  the FA core complex to chromatin. The FA core complex is a ubiquitin E3 ligase composed
  of eight FA proteins (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, FANCM; blue
  circles) as well as FA associated proteins (FAAPs) (white circle). The FA core complex
  monoubiquitinates the FANCD2:FANCI complex (pink rectangles) in conjunction with
  the E2 conjugating enzyme FANCT (green rectangle). The activated FANCI:FANCD2 (ID)
  complex then allows the recruitment of translesion synthesis and homologous recombination
  complex proteins (orange and purple ovals) to complete DNA repair. Silver spiral
  strand: interstrand cross link in the DNA double helix. Arrow: activation. FANCS/BRCA1:
  Breast cancer susceptibility protein 1; FANCN/PALB2: Partner and localizer of BRCA2;
  FANCJ/BRIP: BRCA interacting protein; FANCW/RFWD3: ring finger and WD repeat domain
  protein; FANCU/XRCC2: X-ray repair cross complementing protein; FANCP/SLX4: structure-specific
  endonuclease subunit; FANCD1/BRCA2: Breast cancer susceptibility protein 2; FANCO/RAD51C:
  Fanconi anemia, complementation group O; FANCR/RAD51: Fanconi anemia, complementation
  group R; FANCV/REV7: Fanconi anemia, complementation group V; FANCQ/ERCC4: Excision
  repair, complementing defective, in Chinese hamster, 4. The Fanconi anemia (FA)
  DNA repair pathway specializes in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs).
