  NRF2/NFE2L2 (NFE2-like bZIP transcription factor 2) a basic leucine sipper (bZIP)
  protein is a transcription factor that regulates genes which contain antioxidant
  response element (ARE) in the promoters. Under homeostatic conditions, NRF2 forms
  a complex with KEAP1, a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase to be targeted for proteosome-dependent
  degradation. However, upon exposure to diverse chemicals with an electrophilic center,
  KEAP1 will be oxidized and release NRF2 into nucleus to activate ARE-containing
  genes. Among the NRF2 responsive genes are antioxidant proteins including GPX2,
  GPX3, SOD and other proteins such as P62/SQSTM1
