figure_title: GO and KEGG analysis of CXCL10 and its co-regulation genes. (A) GO analysis
  is presented by point charts. (B) Gene expression level of tumor and tumor microenvironment
  cells in normal and tumor tissues. (C) Linear regression of CXCL10 with macrophages
  (CD163, AIF1) and T-cells (CD8A, CD8B). (D) KEGG analysis is presented by point
  charts. (E) Gene expression level of NOD-like receptor signaling pathway related
  genes in normal and tumor tissues. (F) Expression levels of key NOD-like receptor
  signaling pathway genes. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001
