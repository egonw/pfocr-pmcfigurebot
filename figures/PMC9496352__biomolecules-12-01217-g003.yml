caption: D-glutamine and the D-glutamate metabolism pathways and associated gene expression
  were affected. (A) Analysis of all metabolites with significant differences. The
  metabolism enrichment index of D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism was highest
  in metabolic activities (p < 0.005). The higher the enrichment index, the more obviously
  the pathway was affected, and p < 0.05 indicated that the result was statistically
  significant. (B) Five substances in the pathway were downregulated. In the metabolite
  association analysis, all four metabolites were associated with the production of
  L-glutamic acid. (C,D) Map of all L-glutamic-acid-related differentiated metabolites
  and gene networks in metabolite association analysis (C) and metabolite (green circle)–gene
  (red hexagon) association analysis (D). (E) Pattern diagram of integrated metabolite–gene
  interaction network. Green indicates metabolites that are detected and also reduced,
  and black indicates metabolites with insignificant changes. Blue represents genes,
  with arrows pointing to suggest trends. Other colours without special instructions
  do not imply trend change. (Aldh4a1, aldehyde dehydrogenase family 4, member A1,
  Gls, glutaminase, Got, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, Gpt, glutamine-pyruvate
  transaminase, Glul, glutamate-ammonia ligase).
