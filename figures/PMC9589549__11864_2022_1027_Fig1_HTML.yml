caption: Intestinal microbiota is associated with immune metabolism. (1) Microbial
  PRRs directly stimulate intestinal immunity and increase the expression of TLRS
  and NLRs. The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway then can be activated. (2) In response to
  PAMPs, APCs are activated and matured, resulting in B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes
  becoming activated. (3) The intestinal microbiota can also influence the immune
  system by releasing SCFAs and polyamines. This can lead to the secretion of intestinal
  IgA as well as the maintenance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier.
