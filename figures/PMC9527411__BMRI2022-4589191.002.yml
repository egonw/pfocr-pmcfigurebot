caption: Metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid. COX is cyclooxygenase. PGs are prostaglandins.
  CYP450 is cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. EETs are epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. LOX
  is lipoxygenase. LTs are leukotrienes. 12S-HpETE is 12S-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic
  acid. PhGPx is phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase. 12-HETE is 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid. HXA3 is hepoxilin A3. EH is epoxy hydrolase. TrXA3 is trioxilin A3.
