caption: 'EESS-loaded liposome suppressed Aβ-induced cognition and synaptic plasticity
  deficits via Erk signaling pathway. (a,c) show representative images of Western
  blot analysis of p-Erk1/2/Erk1/2 in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively. (b,d)
  show the relative p-Erk1/2/Erk1/2 levels in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively.
  Data were presented as means ± SEM. * indicates significant difference (p < 0.05)
  between Aβ and sham groups; # indicates significant difference (p < 0.05) between
  EESS-loaded liposome, AST-commercial and Aβ groups; n = 5 rats/group.'
