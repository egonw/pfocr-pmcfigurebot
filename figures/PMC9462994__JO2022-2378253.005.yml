caption: The oncogenic function of CKAP2L in ESCC cells was dependent on cell cycle
  regulation. (a) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
  on GSE17351. (b) Functional protein association network constructed using STRING.
  (c) The correlation between CKAP2L and cell cycle-related protein expression predicted
  by the GEPIA database. (d) Effects of shCKAP2L on the cell cycle progression of
  KYSE150 cells measured by flow cytometric analysis ∗P < 0.05 by student's t-test.
  (e) The expression of Cyclin B1 and CDK1 was analyzed by western blot ∗P < 0.05
  by student's t-test. The data were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3).
