caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of interactions among highlighted significant DEGs throughout
  the 1st MT from S to O blastocysts (O vs. S) and across the OMT from S to T blastocysts
  (T vs. S) that indicate differential conceptus regulation of cytokine and growth
  factor signaling throughout the initiation of elongation. Conceptus IFN‐γ can induce
  expression of CXCL12 within both the conceptus and endometrium; CXCL12 can recruit
  Tregs to the maternal‐conceptus interface. Conceptus IL1Bs activate NF‐κB, which
  can also induce expression of IL1Bs. Endometrial FGF7 and IGF‐1, as well as conceptus
  FGF10, signal through the MAPK pathway by binding to conceptus FGFR2 and IGF1R.
  Additionally, binding of conceptus IGFBP3 to IGF‐1 may inhibit its attachment to
  IGF1R. Cleavage of IGFBP3 by plasmin to increase IGF‐1 bioavailability may be reduced
  through inhibition of PA plasminogen activation by conceptus SERPINE1. RBP4 may
  regulate delivery of RDs to the conceptus, which can induce expression of conceptus
  TGFBs. Latent TGF‐β complexes secreted by the conceptus can facilitate maternal‐conceptus
  attachment by binding to ITGs on both the endometrium and conceptus. These interactions
  between latent TGF‐β complexes and ITGs may also induce conformational changes in
  the latent complexes, enabling binding of bioactive TGF‐βs to both conceptus and
  endometrial TGFBRs. Further, PA‐activated plasmin is also able to generate bioactive
  TGF‐βs through proteolysis of latent TGF‐βs. All highlighted conceptus DEGs were
  significant between both O versus S and T versus S distinct morphologies unless
  specifically indicated by an asterisk: orange asterisk = significant between O versus
  S, while not significant between T versus S. Significant DEGs between blastocysts
  at sequential stages of development throughout the 1st MT are indicated by bubbles
  corresponding to specific developmental stage comparisons: 1a = ST1 versus S; and
  1c = O versus OT1. Green DEGs, upregulated; red DEGs, downregulated; ITGs, integrins;
  LAP, latency‐associated peptide; MAPK, mitogen‐activated protein kinase; NF‐κB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; PA, plasminogen activator; pln, plasmin; plngn, plasminogen;
  RDs, retinoids; TGFBRs, TGF‐β receptors; Treg, regulatory T cell'
