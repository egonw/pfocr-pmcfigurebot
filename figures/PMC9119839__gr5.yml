caption: TRPC5OS activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and regulates glucose uptake in breast
  cancer cell lines.Levels of total and phosphorylated PI3K and Akt in TRPC5OS-overexpressing
  and -repressed breast cancer cells were detected by western blot analysis (A, B).
  Bar graphs of the ratio of phosphoPI3K/total PI3K, phosphoAkt/total Akt in TRPC5OS-overexpressing
  or -repressed breast cancer cells (C, D). Glucose uptake in TRPC5OS-overexpressing
  and -repressed cells was investigated by liquid scintillation spectrometry (E).
  Viability of ENO1-overexpressing and -repressed breast cancer cells was determined
  by CCK8 assay, colony-formation, and EdU-incorporation assays (F-I).
