figure_title: Three-dimensional structure, effects of SIRT1 and the underlying mechanism.
  SIRT1 has obvious effects in regulating a variety of respiratory diseases by acting
  on different momentous substrates. SIRT1 can regulate gastric cancer, NSCLC, and
  sepsis-associated liver injury by activating the STAT3/MMP-13 pathway or inhibiting
  the JAK/STAT3 pathway, especially via STAT3. SIRT1 affects gouty arthritis, hyperuricemia,
  and allergic inflammation by activating ABCG2, inhibiting Th2 response and inflammatory
  cell infiltration, especially through binding with PPAR-γ. SIRT1 can modulate diabetic
  cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, and arterial thrombosis through inhibiting PD-1,
  cardiomyocyte apoptosis, vWF, and P-selectin, especially acting on FOXO-1. SIRT1
  can control COPD, diabetic nephropathy, oxidative stress, and inflammation by activating
  autophagy, mitophagy, or regulating mitochondrial function, mitochondrial biogenesis,
  especially via PGC-1α
