caption: The mechanisms and therapeutic targets of autophagy in neurodegenerative
  diseases. An increasing number of genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases,
  especially AD, PD, HD, and ALS, act at different steps throughout the autophagic
  process. Their proposed sites of action, as well as associated neurodegenerative
  diseases are indicated. The protein aggregates, supposed to be degraded by the autophagy–lysosome
  pathway, accumulate and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases when autophagy
  is defective. AD, Alzheimer's disease; PD, Parkinson's disease; HD, Huntington's
  disease; ALS, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
