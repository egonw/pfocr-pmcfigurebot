caption: 'Effects of DEAC on TLR-4, p-NF-κB, p-JNK, and p-ERK1/2 expression in LPS-stimulated
  BV-2 cells. Cells were pretreated with DEAC (100 μg/mL) for 1 h and incubated with
  LPS (0.5 μg/mL) for 1 more hour. The results are expressed as mean ± SEM. For statistical
  analysis, one-way ANOVA (a), two-way ANOVA (b–d), followed by Bonferroni posttest.
  #p < 0.05 vs. negative control (0.1% DMSO, drug vehicle), ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  vs. LPS group, n = 4/group.'
