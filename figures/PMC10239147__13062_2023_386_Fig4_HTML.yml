caption: 'Knockdown of LINC01003 inhibited the CAV1-FAK signaling pathway. A The heatmap
  reflected the differently expressed genes (DEGs)Â regulated by LINC01003 knockdown.
  B A volcano plot of DEGs from (A). C Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway analysis was performed for the 557 downregulated genes regulated by LINC01003
  knockdown from (B). D Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of p-FAK
  and CAV1 in U87MG and U251 cells with LINC01003 knockdown. Up: upregulation; Down:
  downregulation; No: no change'
article_title: m6A-mediated upregulation of LINC01003 regulates cell migration by
  targeting the CAV1/FAK signaling pathway in glioma.
