caption: Functional enrichment of DEPPs related to A-Raf and regulated during T. gondii
  infection. DEPPs data set used for the functional analyses was the DEPPs with the
  same phosphorylated sites in the comparison of p3T/pho3 versus p3T/p3KT. The X axis
  indicates the number of DEPPs. The Y axis represents GO terms (A) and KEGG pathway
  maps (B). C KEGG pathway enrichment of the DEPPs related to A-Raf
article_title: Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals changes in A-Raf-related protein
  phosphorylation in response to Toxoplasma gondii infection in porcine macrophages.
