caption: CircNDRG1 inhibited the metastasis of bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo.
  (A) The silence efficiency of circNDRG1 and linear mRNA NDRG1 by circNDRG1-si. (B
  and C) Transwell and wound-healing assay indicated the silence of circNDRG1 promoted
  the migration of bladder cancer cells. Cells were pretreated with nitroxoline (10
  µM) for 24 hours. (D) The overexpression efficiency of circNDRG1 was determined
  by RT-qPCR. (E and F) Transwell and wound-healing assay showed the overexpression
  of circNDRG1 inhibited the migration of bladder cancer. Cells were pretreated with
  nitroxoline (10 µM) for 24 hours. (G and H) UM-UC-3 cells stably transfected with
  circNDRG1-sh and vector were injected into nude mice by tail veins and bioluminescent
  signals were measured by the IVIS imaging system. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
