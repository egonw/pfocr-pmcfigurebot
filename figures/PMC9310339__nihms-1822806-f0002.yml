caption: 'Cell death-related functions. Panel A: Significant cell death-related diseases
  and functions among genes differentially expressed in irradiated WT, DKI, and DN
  mice as identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Panel B: Significant cell-death
  functions among genes differentially expressed in p38DN vs. p38WT mice under basal
  conditions as identified by IPA. Biological functions displaying a z-score ≥ 2 or
  ≤ −2 and showing Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05 were considered significant.
  Abbreviations, WT: p38 wild-type; DKI: p38 double knock-in mutant; DN: p38 dominant
  negative.'
