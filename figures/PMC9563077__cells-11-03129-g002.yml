caption: 'Constitutive activation of FGFR2 (p.Cys342Arg) enhanced osteogenesis via
  Erk1/2 MAPK signaling pathway: (A) Schematic representation of the relative linear
  location in which the FGFR2 mutation is identified as illustrated by the large red
  arrow shown in the context of the protein structure. (B) CCK-8 assay was carried
  out to assess cell proliferation. Proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells was more active
  in the MT group. (C) Relative expressions of osteogenic marker measured by qPCR.
  The expressions of Alp, ColIÎ±2, Runx2, Opn and Ocn mRNA in differentiated MC3T3-e1
  were remarkably increased in the MT group. Western blot analysis showed that the
  level of ALP, COLI and RUNX2 were also increased in the MT group. (D) ALP staining,
  alizarin red staining and quantitative tests. ALP staining showed increased crystal
  violet-staining cells in the MT group compared with the WT group. Quantitative experiment
  demonstrated that ALP activity is more active in the MT group. Alizarin red staining
  and quantitative test showed there were more mineralized nodules and mineral content
  in the MT group than in the WT group. (E) Western blot analysis demonstrated that
  the levels of p-FGFR2 and p-Erk1/2 were increased in the MT group. There was no
  significant change in the expression of key proteins in other downstream pathways.
  The western blot results of FGF/FGFR2-Erk1/2 was circled by the red frame. p values
  were significant at * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001.'
