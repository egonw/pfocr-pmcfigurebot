caption: Significant Transcription factor-metabolic pathway interconnecting paths/network
  in cervical cancer. (A) represents a significant transcription factor metabolic
  interaction network, (B) shows the transcription factor to metabolic pathways interconnectivity,
  and (C) shows the significant transcription factor to metabolic paths regulating
  metabolites in cervical cancer. Terminal transcription factors and metabolic enzymes
  are colored green and blue. Protein-protein interactors are colored in orange. Gene
  regulatory edges are represented as black arrows and protein-protein interactions
  are represented by orange edges. Nodes with an asterisk (*) are key or effector
  nodes in the significant paths/network.
