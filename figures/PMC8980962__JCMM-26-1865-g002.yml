caption: Receptors that signal through a phosphotyrosine‐independent pathway. (A)
  hIL‐22R, (B) hIFN‐λ‐R, (C) mIL‐23R, (D) hG‐CSFR and (E) hIFNAR signal through a
  classical JAK‐STAT signalling pathway as well as an alternative pathway. This alternative
  pathway is independent of tyrosines of the receptor. Graphs are not to scale
article_title: 'JAK/STAT: Why choose a classical or an alternative pathway when you
  can have both?.'
