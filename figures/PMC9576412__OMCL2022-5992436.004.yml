caption: 'Renal I/R-generated pyroptosis and apoptosis could be regulated by ER stress
  in mice. Mice in the 4-PBA+I/R group were injected intraperitoneally with 4-PBA
  (100 mg/kg, dilution in phosphate-buffered saline) 24 h before undergoing renal
  I/R surgery. (a, b) The levels of serum Cr and serum BUN in renal I/R injury decreased
  notably after inhibiting ER stress by 4-PBA application. (c, d) Quantitative analysis
  of tubular injury scores and representative images of H&E staining in different
  groups. (e) KIM-1 protein levels were assessed by western blot analysis. (f) The
  established inhibitor 4-PBA effectively restrained the protein expression of GRP78,
  CHOP, and caspase-12 in renal I/R injury. (g) The inhibition of ER stress by 4-PBA
  tremendously depressed the caspase-1 activity in mice with renal I/R surgery. (h)
  The mRNA levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 in the I/R group declined after the
  application of 4-PBA. (i, j) 4-PBA as one specific inhibitor of ER stress remarkably
  depressed the activation of pyroptosis-related protein markers including NLRP3,
  ASC, caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, and caspase-11. (k) The protein levels of apoptotic
  markers consisting of BAX, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3. Values measured during
  animal experiments were carried out as mean ± SD, n = 3 − 5. ∗P < 0.05, compared
  with the Sham group; #P < 0.05, relative to the NS+I/R group.'
