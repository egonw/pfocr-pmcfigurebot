caption: The functional role of ERRα in osteogenic and osteolytic metastases. Both
  osteogenic and osteolytic metastases are involved in the interactions among tumor
  cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, osteogenic and osteolytic metastases can reciprocally
  transit. In the osteogenic lesions, ERRα overexpression in prostate cancer cells
  directly or indirectly modulate bone re-modeling by boosting the expression of metastasis
  factors (VEGF-A, TGFβ1, WNT5A). The interactive modulation between osteoblasts and
  osteoclasts generates a tumor-friendly environment to facilitate tumor anchoring
  and growth. In the breast cancer, ERRα promotes the cell growth in situ but inhibits
  the proliferation of breast cancer cells in bone via increasing angiogenesis and
  exacerbating bone environment (OPN-mediated growth repression and cytokines-induced
  immune activation). Moreover, ERRα also facilitates the breast cancer dissemination
  to the bone through upregulating RANK and activating mTOR signaling pathway.
