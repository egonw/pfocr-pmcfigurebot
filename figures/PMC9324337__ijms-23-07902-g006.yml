caption: Macrophage genes expression in h3D and t3D matrix. (a) M2-markers and for
  (b) HSPG2, (c) canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway by qRT-PCR. One-way ANOVA
  and Tukey correction were used to evaluate the differences between means; * p <
  0.033, ** p < 0.002, *** p < 0.0002, **** p < 0.0001. n = 3 for each experimental
  group.
