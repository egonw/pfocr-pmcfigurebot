figure_title: Human melanoma has a positional identity defined by HOX genes
caption: 'Related to . (a) GSEA pathway analysis for top enriched pathways in human
  acral melanoma and is controlled for disease stage. Limb development pathways and
  positional identity-related pathways are highlighted. See  for a full list of pathways.
  (b) GSEA barcode plot showing enrichment for the GO: Appendage Development pathway
  in acral melanoma, generated with WKS testing. NES and FDR = 0.05 adjusted p-values
  are indicated. (c) PCA of all samples based on the expression of just HOX genes.
  Color indicates the combination of melanoma subtype and disease stage. (d) N = 3
  acral melanoma tissue microarrays of n = 32 samples total from Sloan Kettering was
  used for staining for H&E, CRKL, HOXB13, and pIGF1R. (e) Extent and intensity of
  each sample was independently scored by a Sloan Kettering dermatopathologist and
  is represented in a pie chart. 2 samples were removed from the analysis due to heavy
  pigmentation, resulting in n = 30 samples total used for IHC quantification analysis.
  Extent scores range 0− 4 and intensity scores range 0–3. (f) N = 3 cutaneous melanoma
  tissue microarrays of n = 14 total samples from Sloan Kettering was used for staining
  for H&E, CRKL, HOXB13, and pIGF1R. (g) Extent and intensity of each sample was independently
  scored by a Sloan Kettering dermatopathologist and is represented in a pie chart.
  Extent scores range 0–4 and intensity scores range 0–3. (h) CRKL, HOXB13, and pIGF1R
  antibodies were optimized on human tissues chosen for their expression characterized
  by the Human Protein Atlas. CRKL is a ubiquitously expressed protein with relatively
  high expression in the colonic epithelia and lower expression in liver. HOXB13 is
  expressed in prostate epithelia with low expression in liver and skin (anatomic
  source unknown). pIGF1R demonstrates higher levels in prostate epithelia, colon
  epithelia, tonsil, and lower levels in skin. See  for details regarding antibody,
  concentration, and staining procedure.'
