caption: GTP‐CDC42 required for promotion of CRC cell migration by CRC‐EV‐activated
  NOD1 in macrophages. (a) Relative levels of NOD1, CDC42 and p‐RIP2 in THP‐1 cells
  incubated with EV‐HT29 (left), or BMDMs incubated with EV‐MC38 (right); (n = 3).
  (b) GTP‐bound state of CDC42 in THP‐1 cells incubated with EV‐HT29 or EV‐MC38; (n = 3).
  (c) GTP‐bound state of CDC42 in THP‐1 cells incubated with EV‐HT29 pre‐treated with
  ML141(20 μM; left), and THP‐1 cells incubated with EV‐sh‐NC‐HT29 or EV‐sh‐CDC42‐HT29
  (right); (n = 3). (d) Wound‐healing assay and (e) transwell assay of HT29 cells
  in response to CM from THP‐1 cells stimulated by EV‐sh‐NC‐HT29 or EV‐sh‐CDC42‐HT29.
  (f) Wound‐healing assay and (g) transwell assay of HT29 cells following treatment
  with CM from THP‐1 cells incubated with EV‐HT29 pre‐incubated with ML141(20 μM).
  Representative micrographs and relative migration rates are displayed. Student's
  t‐test; error bar, S.E.M.*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
