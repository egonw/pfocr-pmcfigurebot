caption: UBE2C enhanced EGFR protein stability. Following stimulation for 0, or 15
  min with EGF (A) or HGF (B), the expression of the indicated proteins was assessed
  in PANC1 and Mia-capa2 cells, with GAPDH as a loading control. (C) Anti-FLAG was
  used for co-immunoprecipitation analyses of PC cells following FLAG-UBE2C and HA-EGFR
  or empty vector control co-transfection as indicated. (D) The knockdown of UBE2C
  was associated with reductions in the stability of EGFR in cells that had been treated
  with CHX for 0, 3 or 6 hours. (E) The MG132 proteasome inhibitor was sufficient
  to ablate changes in EGFR degradation observed following the knockdown of UBE2C.
