caption: 'Gene expression data groups tumors with diverse genetic alterations that
  affect similar biological processes. Tumors were clustered in four groups (EX1–EX4)
  based on their resemblance to the four expression profiles identified by unsupervised
  analysis of the 10,000 most variably expressed genes (see methods). (A) Tumors (columns)
  of each expression cluster show upregulation of the genes (rows) of the corresponding
  expression profile compared to tumors of other expression clusters. Shown are the
  top 50 genes of each expression profile sorted by log2-fold change (l2fc). Tumors
  are annotated by their histological subtype. (B) Representative biological processes
  enriched in expression profiles (q-value < 0.05). (C) Oncoplot of tumors grouped
  by their expression cluster with alterations (left) and CN profiles with SVs (right),
  similar to . The Oncoplot displays alterations affecting recurrently altered cancer
  genes, Wnt pathway genes and WT associated genes from Treger et. al. (2019) [].
  Alteration types: SNVs (purple) and SV breakpoints (light green), as well as nearby
  or overlapping SVs (dark green) and CNs (orange) in case of a gene expression change
  (nz-score >+/−1.98). The CNs and SVs are displayed for recurrently altered chromosomes
  1, 8, 11, 12, 16 and 17, depicted as in B. See  for gene alteration data and  and  for
  full sized figures.'
