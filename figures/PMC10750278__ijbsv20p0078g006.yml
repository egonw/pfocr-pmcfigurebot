caption: SECTM1 regulates glioma migration and invasive phenotype through TGF-β1/Smad
  pathway and SECTM1 knockdown inhibits the EMT-like process in glioma. The correlation
  between SECTM1 gene and TGFβ pathway (A) and EMT marker (B) in glioma was analyzed
  in TCGA. (C-F) Western blotting showed the changes of downstream genes of TGF-β1/Smad
  pathway after SECTM1 knockdown in U87 MG cells (C, D) and U251 MG (E, F), where
  D and F were the quantitative gray values of WB experiment. All data were presented
  as mean ± SD (three independent experiments). * P < 0.05; * * P < 0.01; * * * P
  < 0.001.
