caption: Inflammatory signalling pathways as potential targets of SGLT2 inhibitors.
  SGLT2 inhibitors supress the mitochondrial complex I eventually predisposing to
  the induction of AMPK/mTOR/autophagy signalling. Autophagy directly inhibits inflammasome
  activation, while it also attenuates NF-κB mediated release of several inflammatory
  cytokines together with NLRP3, an essential component of the inflammasome. Increased
  intracellular Ca2+, enhanced K+ efflux and lysosomal degradation can signal inflammasome
  assembly and activation. On that note, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce intracellular Ca2+
  levels which can contribute to the inhibition of inflammasome activation and subsequent
  attenuation of IL-1β release. The overall reduction of inflammatory cytokines enhances
  M2 macrophage production and reduce their polarization to the pro-inflammatory M1
  subtype, a process which was also directly modulated by SGLT2 inhibitors. These
  direct actions on inflammation can explain the CV benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.
  Blue arrows, represent the normal signalling pathway; red arrows, represent decreased
  expression upon SGLT2 inhibitor treatment; green arrows, represent enhanced expression.
