caption: 'Landscape of small-scale mutations reveals recurrent events affecting PI-3-K/AKT
  pathway genes in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. (A) Number of
  small-scale mutations per patient. The distribution of missense, nonsense, frameshift
  and splice site mutations per patient is shown. (B) Distribution of nucleotide substitutions
  per patient. (C) Median contribution of COSMIC mutational signatures in primary
  cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) (n=7) and Sézary syndrome (n=30).
  AID SHM: activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation; DSBRD:
  doublestrand break repair deficiency; SS: Sézary syndrome; UV: ultraviolet. (D)
  Gene set analysis of genes affected by indels and single nucleotide variants (SNV)
  in pcALCL. Mutated genes were primarily involved in G-protein signaling and the
  PI-3-K pathway. (E) Diagram showing small-scale mutations affecting PIK3R1 and PDPK1
  in patients with pcALCL. Splice site mutations in PIK3R1 are predicted to affect
  the three known protein isoforms (i.e., p85α, p55α and p50α) encoded by this gene.
  Missense mutations in PDPK1 impacted the PH domain of its encoded protein. (F) Sanger
  chromatograms showing validation of splice site and missense mutations in PIK3R1
  and PDPK1, respectively.'
