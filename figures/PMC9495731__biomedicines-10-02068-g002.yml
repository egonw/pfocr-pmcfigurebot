caption: Global gene expression profile of HSV receptors in DRGO. (A) Supervised gene
  expression heatmaps showing the HSV receptor genes differentially expressed either
  in DRG vs. iPSC or in DIV 40 DRGO vs. iPSC; the correlation between samples is also
  shown as an unsupervised hierarchical clustered dendrogram on the side. (B,C) Gene
  expression heatmaps showing the differentially expressed genes belonging to aggregated
  GO categories associated with heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathways (B) and integrin-mediated
  signaling pathway (C); the correlation between samples is also shown as an unsupervised
  hierarchical clustered dendrogram on the side.
