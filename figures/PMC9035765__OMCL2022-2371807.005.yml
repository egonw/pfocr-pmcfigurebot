caption: Inhibition of caspase-3 activation and pyroptosis was reduced in GSDME-expressing
  cells. (a–c) The IC50 values of three cell lines were detected using CCK-8. (d–h)
  The expression levels of GSDME-N and pathway proteins were determined by WB. (i)
  The death morphologies of the three cell lines were observed using an Olympus microscope
  after the three cell lines were treated to Z-DEVD-FML and carboplatin; black arrows,
  apoptotic cells. (j and k) Flow cytometry showed the ratio of FITC monostaining
  to FITC and PI double-positive staining after treatment with Z-DEVD-FML and carboplatin,
  and quantitative maps were drawn for carboplatin-treated cells after 24 h. (l) LDH
  in the cell supernatant was detected by ELISA. Each experiment was repeated at least
  three times. Scale bar, 100 μm.
