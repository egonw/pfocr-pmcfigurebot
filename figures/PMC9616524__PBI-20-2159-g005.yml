caption: Transcriptome profiles of SGS affected genes and pathways across diverse
  soybean compartments. (a) Hierarchical clustered heatmap of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) between healthy and SGS diseased samples across diverse soybean compartments.
  DEGs with ¦log2FC¦ > 2 (FC, fold change) and adjusted P‐value < 0.01 were displayed
  in the heatmap. Columns on the right indicate DEGs that are categorized as SGS disease
  induced (red line) and deduced (blue line) gene sets. (b) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of SGS induced DEGs across diverse soybean compartments. The enriched ratio
  and FDR‐adjusted enrichment P‐value of the pathway were indicated using the size
  and colour of the bubble points, respectively. (c) The pathway‐gene network of the
  particular genes induced in SGS diseased seeds in each terms of the enriched KEGG
  pathways.
