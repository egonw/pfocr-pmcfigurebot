caption: TKS5 is involved in AKT pathway activation in Y235T, RT4 and UMUC3 cells.
  (A) Protein levels of phospho-AKT (Ser473), phospho-AKT (Thr308) and total-AKT in
  Y235T parental, Y235T-shScramble and Y235T-shTKS5 cells. (B) Protein levels of phospho-AKT
  (Ser473), phospho-AKT (Thr308) and total-AKT in RT4 parental, RT4-shScramble and
  RT4-shTKS5 cells. (C) Protein levels of phospho-AKT (Ser473), phospho-AKT (Thr308)
  and total-AKT in UMUC3 parental, UMUC3 empty vector (EV) or UMUC3 with ectopic TKS5
  cells. We used the same lysates and membranes to detect the target proteins (TKS5
  and AKT) and internal reference protein (β-actin). Please note that one ß-actin
  membrane served as the loading control for both pAKT targets. We repeated all the
  experiments three times with different lysates. The quantitation of the blots are
  presented in the supplemental data ().
