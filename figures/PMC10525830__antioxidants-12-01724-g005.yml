caption: 'Effects of KEPS and KE on the ex vivo bioluminescence signaling of LPS-induced
  inflammation in various organs of NF-κB-luciferase+/+ transgenic mice. (A) The arrangement
  of mouse organs in a bright field for ex vivo IVIS imaging. (B) The representative
  IVIS images of different organs in female NF-κB-luciferase+/+ transgenic mice. (C)
  The quantification data of bioluminescence signals in various organs of female mice,
  including the heart, kidney, spleen, pancreas, lung, and gut. (D) The representative
  IVIS images of different organs in male NF-κB-luciferase+/+ transgenic mice. (E)
  The quantification data of bioluminescence signals in various organs of male mice.
  The data are presented as mean ± SD. (n = 3). Statistical significance is indicated
  as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared to the control group, #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 compared to the LPS alone group, and &p < 0.05 compared
  to the KE/LPS group.'
