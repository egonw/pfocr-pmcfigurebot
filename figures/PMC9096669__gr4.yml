caption: 'Fecal microbiome transfer affects short-chain fatty acid levels and changes
  the metabolic transcriptome of MC38 tumors in FMT recipient mice. A) Circulating
  propionic acid in serum in Chow–Chow (n = 9), HFD-Chow (n = 10), HFD (n = 7) and
  HFD-Met (n = 6) FMT recipient mice as measured by LC-MS. B) Circulating butyric
  acid in serum in Chow–Chow (n = 9), HFD-Chow (n = 10), HFD (n = 7) and HFD-Met (n = 6)
  FMT recipient mice as measured by LC-MS. C) Pathways identified with GSEA to have
  significant downregulation in HFD-Met FMT (n = 4) mice compared to HFD FMT (n = 4)
  mice. D) Heat map of genes in the cholesterol metabolism pathway (most enriched
  pathway in transcriptomics data set) (n = 4 per group). E) In vitro MC38 clonogenic
  growth with 0.05–1 mM of butyrate (n = 8 independent experiments for each concentration,
  excluding 0.05 mM, n = 6). Statistics: One-way ANOVA with Tukey (A, B, F) post-hoc
  testing, and unpaired two-sided t-testing (A, B, E) was used for a direct comparison
  of HFD-FMT and HFD-Met FMT (A, B). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; δ p < 0.05
  for unpaired two-sided t-testing.'
