caption: AKR1C1 knockdown remodeled the expression profiles of metabolic genes. AKR1C1
  siRNA was introduced into NCI-H460 cells for twice at the confluency of 60%. 36
  h later, cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent followed by microarray analysis. KEGG
  pathway (a) and Heat map (b) from microarray data were shown. Genes with a fold-change
  ≥2 were used for KEGG analysis, including the most downregulated and upregulated
  genes (siAKR1C1 vs. NC). The ListHit for Biosynthesis of antibiotics was 53, for
  Pyruvate metabolism was 15, for Peroxisome was 25, for HIF-1 signaling pathway was
  29, for Cysteine and methionine metabolism was 14, for Cell cycle was 33, for Transcriptional
  misregulation in cancer was 44, for Insulin signaling pathway was 36, for RNA transport
  was 41, for Fatty acid metabolism was 15. c. qRT-PCR technology was conducted to
  evaluate the levels of metabolic genes. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.
