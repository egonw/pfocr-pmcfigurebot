caption: 'H8 inhibits 11β-HSD1 as well as increases the expression of SIRT1 and phosphorylation
  of AMPK. In rat liver: (A) the relative mRNA expression; (B) the representative
  Western blot images; (C) the protein=expression levels. In cells: (D) the relative
  mRNA-expression levels; (E) the representative Western blot images; (F) the protein
  expression levels; (G) immunofluorescence staining, green fluorescence FITC represents
  the protein P-AMPK, red fluorescence CY3 represents the protein SIRT1, nuclei were
  visualized by DAPI (scale bar, 50 μm). The data represent the mean ± SEM. # p <
  0.05, ## p < 0.01 versus the control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus the HFD+STZ
  group.'
