figure_title: Wnts are upregulated as an immediate response to BMP4 signaling in mESC-derived
  NPCs
caption: '(A) Timelines for bulk RNA-seq analysis of protocol 3 (n = 3).(B) Venn diagram
  showing the overlap of genes significantly upregulated after 6 and 24 h of RA +
  BMP4 treatment (logFC > 2, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01). 78 genes were common
  to both comparisons.(C) GO analysis of the 78 common genes shows the upregulation
  of the Wnt signaling pathway in all three GO categories: biological processes, molecular
  processes, and pathway categories.(D) Heatmap showing the expression (FPKM, N =
  3) of 19 Wnt ligands at day 4 (dP state1), day 4.25 (immediate response to BMP4),
  and day 5 (dP state2).(E) Volcano plots showing upregulated genes at 6 and 24 h
  of RA + BMP4 treatment. Multiple Wnt ligands and Wnt pathway genes are highly upregulated
  in both conditions.(F) qRT-PCR validation of selected Wnt genes under RA, RA + BMP4,
  and RA + BMP4 + noggin conditions at day 5. Wnt expression was significantly upregulated
  by BMP4 but reduced in the presence of noggin. n = 3 differentiations. The data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM. Significance is determined by two-way ANOVA (Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test), *p < 0.05, **p < 0 .005, ***p < 0.0005.'
