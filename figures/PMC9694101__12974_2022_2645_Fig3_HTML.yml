caption: Knock-down miR-26a-3p in hippocampus promoted inflammatory response. A Immunofluorescent
  staining showed the Iba-1-positive microglia. B The number of Iba-1-positive microglia
  within the hippocampal region was significantly increased after knock-down of miR-26a-3p.
  C The microglia significantly activated in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. D The expression
  of CD11b and CD45 was significantly increased in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. E–H
  The pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats. I,
  J The anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased in miR-26a-3p knock-down rats.
  Data are presented as the means ± SEMs. N = 6–8 per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001
