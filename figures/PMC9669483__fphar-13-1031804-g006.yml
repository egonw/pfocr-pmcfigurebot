caption: (A) Effect of DEX on mechanical withdrawal threshold in MTrPs group rats.
  Increased mechanical withdrawal threshold in MTrPs rats (n = 6) at 1 and 2 h after
  intramuscular injection two concentrations of DEX (10ug/ml and 100ug/ml). (B). The
  expression of TNF-α, p-P65, P65, MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC was detected 2 h after injection
  of two different concentrations of dexmedetomidine (10 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml) into
  the gastrocnemius muscle of MTrPs rats, and the protein levels were found to be
  significantly inhibited. (C). The mRNA expression levels of MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC
  were significantly lower than those of the MTrPs group after dextromethorphan injection,
  with GAPDH as the internal reference mRNA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
