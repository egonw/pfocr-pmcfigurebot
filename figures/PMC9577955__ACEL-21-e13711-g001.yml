caption: 'Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway activation by GlcNAc feeding does not have
  adverse effects in mice. (a) Schematic representation of the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway. The rate‐limiting enzyme glutamine fructose‐6‐phosphate amidotransferase
  (GFAT) is depicted in purple, GlcNAc is marked in blue. GNPDA: Glucosamine‐6‐phosphate
  isomerase 1; GNA1: Glucosamine‐6‐phosphate N‐acetyltransferase; PGM3: Phosphoacetylglucosamine
  mutase; UAP1: UDP‐N‐acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase; GALE: UDP‐glucose 4‐epimerase;
  HK: Hexokinase; NAGK: N‐acetyl‐D‐glucosamine kinase. (b) Drinking volume of control
  (white) and GlcNAc‐treated mice (blue) of both sexes at 3 and 9 months of age. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD (n ≥ 7). Two‐way ANOVA, Tukey''s post‐test; *p < 0.05;
  ns: Not significant. (c) GlcNAc consumption in mg/kg body weight per day of mice
  of both sexes at 3 and 9 months of age. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n ≥ 7).
  Unpaired t‐test; ns: Not significant. (d) Relative UDP‐HexNAc levels in hemibrains
  of control (white) and GlcNAc‐treated mice (blue) of both sexes. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM (n = 6). Unpaired t‐test; ns: Not significant. (e) Blood glucose concentration
  at 0 (fasting), 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after intraperitoneal injection of glucose
  solution (2 g/kg body weight) of control (black) and GlcNAc‐treated mice (blue)
  of both sexes at 10 months of age. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n ≥ 7). Multiple
  unpaired t‐tests; ns: Not significant (f) area under the curve (AUC) calculated
  using data shown in (e). Data are presented as mean ± SD (n ≥ 7). Unpaired t‐test;
  ns: Not significant (g) Body weight of control (black) and GlcNAc‐treated mice (blue)
  of both sexes from 3 to 30 months of age. The data point at 19 months (females)
  is missing since the body weight measurements were not performed for this time point.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD (n ≥ 13). Multiple unpaired t‐tests; **p < 0.01;
  *p < 0.05; only significant changes are indicated'
