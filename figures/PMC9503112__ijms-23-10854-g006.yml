caption: 'Mechanisms of cell death induced by the compounds 7. (a,b) Representative
  data on the cell cycle of SkBr-3 cells after 24 h incubation with 10 μM of 7b (green),
  7c (orange), and 7j (red). Control cells are shown in blue color. (c–e) Apoptosis
  of SkBr-3 cells: (c) control cells, (d) cells incubated with 7c for 24 h cells.
  (e) Apoptosis induction level for 7b,c,j at 5 μM (gray) and 10 μM (violet). Apoptosis
  level in control cells is shown with a black line. Statistical significance is shown
  by asterisks.'
