caption: 'cGMP signaling pathway. cGMP production is induced via activation of either
  NOS or natriuretic peptides (NPs). NO activates NO-GC in the cytosol, and pGC-A
  and pGC-B produce cGMP in the membranous fraction. cGMP stimulates cGK, which phosphorylates
  target proteins. cGMP is degraded by PDEs. PDE5 and 9 are cGMP-specific, and PDE1,
  2, 3, and 10 are dual-substrate PDEs, degrading both cAMP and cGMP. NOS: nitric
  oxide synthase; iNOS: inducible NOS; eNOS: endothelial NOS; nNOS: neuronal NOS;
  NO-GC: soluble guanylate cyclase; Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2 cGMP: cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphate; NF-κB: nuclear factor κB; ANP: atrial
  natriuretic peptide; BNP: brain natriuretic peptide; CNP: C-type natriuretic peptide;
  pGC-A: particulate guanylate cyclase A; pGC-B: particulate guanylate cyclase B;
  cGK: cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, also known as protein
  kinase G (PKG); PDE: phosphodiesterase; CNCG: cyclic nucleotide-gated channel; pCREB:
  phosphorylated cyclic adenosin monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein.'
