caption: Downregulation of TRPM7 expression inhibits cancer stemness cell proliferation-associated
  protein in HNSCC. (A) Analysis of the relationship of TRPM7 with NANOG and BMI-1
  (B) The possible regulation network of TRPM7. (C) Reduced mRNA expression of TRPM7,
  c-Myc, BMI-1, and Nanog proteins and TRPM7 knockdown in SAS and FaDu cells based
  on qPCR analysis. (D) Western blots of tumorspheres derived from HNSCC cells showing
  the expression profiles of TRPM7, NFATC3, c-Myc, BMI-1, Sox2, and Nanog. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01.
