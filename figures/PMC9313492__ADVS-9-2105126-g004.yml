caption: EP300, NCOA3, and SP1 are required for the activation of ACSL4 transcription.
  a) Real‐time qPCR showing ACSL4 mRNA expression (relative to ACTB) in HUH7 and C3A
  cells after transfection with a series of acetyltransferase siRNAs as indicated
  above. NC is the negative control. Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 3).
  One‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. b) Western blots measuring ACSL4
  protein levels in HUH7 (left) and C3A (right) cells after transfection with EP300
  or NCOA3 siRNAs. ACTIN was detected as a loading control. c) ChIP‐seq assays showing
  the peak enrichment of EP300 and NCOA3 at the ACSL4 promoter and enhancer regions
  in HUH7 cells. Peak enrichment of H3K27ac in the ACSL4 promoter and enhancer regions
  after EP300 or NCOA3 knockdown. d) ChIP‐PCR showing EP300 and NCOA3 enrichment (relative
  to 1% input) at ACSL4 promoter regions in HUH7 cells. e) ChIP‐PCR showing H3K27ac
  enrichment (relative to 1% input) at the ACSL4 promoter (left) and enhancer (right)
  regions in HUH7 cells after EP300 or NCOA3 knockdown. Data are represented as the
  mean ± SD (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. f) Luciferase
  assay measuring the active regions of the ACSL4 promoter in HUH7 cells by using
  a series of truncated regions of the ACSL4 promoter. Schematic diagram on the left.
  TSS, transcription start site. RLU, relative luciferase unit. Data are represented
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). One‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons correction. g)
  Western blots measuring ACSL4 protein levels in HUH7 (up) and C3A (down) cells after
  SP1 knockdown. ACTIN was detected as a loading control. h) Coimmunoprecipitation
  (Co‐IP) and western blots measuring SP1, P300, NCOA3, and GAPDH in HUH7 cells after
  Co‐IP using SP1, P300, NCOA3, and GAPDH antibodies. i) ChIP‐seq assays showing the
  peak enrichment of SP1 at promoter and enhancer regions of ACSL4. H3K27ac shows
  the promoter and enhancer regions of ACSL4. H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 show the promoter
  and enhancer regions of ACSL4, respectively. ATAC‐seq shows the open region of ACSL4
  gene. j) ChIP‐PCR showing SP1 enrichment (relative to 1% input) at the ACSL4 promoter
  (left) and enhancer (right) regions in HUH7 cells after EP300 or NCOA3 knockdown.
  Data are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Two‐way ANOVA with multiple comparisons
  correction. ns, non‐significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
