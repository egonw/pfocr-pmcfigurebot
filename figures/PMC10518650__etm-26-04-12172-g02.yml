caption: 'Podocyte apoptosis. The results indicated that both high glucose (model)
  and high osmotic pressure induced by mannitol (negative) could induce podocyte apoptosis,
  whereas the apoptosis rate of the podocytes was decreased significantly after Rictor
  knockdown. This suggest that the Rictor/mTOR signaling pathway is involved in podocyte
  apoptosis. *P<0.05 vs. Control group, #P<0.05 vs. Negative, Â§P<0.05 vs. Model and
  &P<0.05 vs. model + siRNA NC. Rictor, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR; siRNA/si,
  small interfering RNA; NC, negative control.'
