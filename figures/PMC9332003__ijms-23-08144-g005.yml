caption: EPO promotes neurogenesis and suppresses neuroinflammation at the protein
  expression level. Western blotting band images (A,F; arrow heads) and relative protein
  expression level bars (B–E, G–J) display the effect of rhEPO in AD mice. Treatment
  with rhEPO significantly increased expression levels of (B,G) Nestin, a neuronal
  precursor cell marker, (C,H) NeuN, a neuronal cell biomarker, and (D,I) BDNF, a
  neurotrophic factor, both in the hippocampus and the cortex. (E,J) The expression
  of TLR4, known as a neuroinflammatory factor, was decreased in the hippocampus in
  the Aβ+EPO group compared to that in the Aβ+saline group. n = 4 per group. * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005, and **** p < 0.0001 according to independent t-test
  in (B–E, G–J).
