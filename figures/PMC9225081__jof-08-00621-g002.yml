caption: PCNA post-translational modifications regulate DDT pathways. When fork stalling
  persists, cells activate DDT mechanisms through post-translational modifications
  on PCNA. Monoubiquitination of PCNA at K164 by Rad6-Rad18 promotes the switch from
  Polδ to translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases for error-prone TLS damage bypass.
  K63 extended polyubiquitination of PCNA on K164 by Mms2/Ubc13-Rad5 for error-free
  damage bypass mediates template switching (TS). This modification might be also
  implied in fork protection by fork reversal. Unloading of SUMO-PCNA bound to Srs2
  (sumoylated by Ubc9-Siz1) provides the salvage recombination pathway (SR) alternatively
  to TS or TLS, either at stalled replication forks (RFs) or, as shown, at gaps left
  behind RFs after re-initiation. Cell cycle stages where DDT processes predominantly
  take place in yeast are indicated. Blocking DNA lesions are depicted as a red star.
