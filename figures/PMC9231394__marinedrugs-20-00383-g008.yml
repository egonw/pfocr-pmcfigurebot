caption: 'COSM improved the LPS/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the livers of HFHSD-fed
  mice. The following indicators were measured after 12 weeks of oral administration
  of COSM in HFHSD mice: (A) WB images of TLR4, NF-κB, and P-NF-κB protein expression;
  (B) TLR4 protein expression level and gene expression level in the liver; (C) expression
  level of NF-κB protein and gene in the liver; (D) protein expression of P-NF-κB
  in the liver. The data are presented as means ± SDs (n = 6). Compared with the model
  group, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001.'
