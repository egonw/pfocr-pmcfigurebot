caption: 'KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment bubble map between drought and control
  groups: (a) positive ion mode; (b) negative ion mode. Bubble sizes represent the
  numbers of metabolites in metabolic pathways whose levels were found to be altered.
  Bubble colors represent p-values from low (blue) to high (red).'
