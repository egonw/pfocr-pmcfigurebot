caption: RPL5 expression is decreased by siRPL5 transfection in human colon cancer
  cells. A Western blotting and (B) reverse transcription-qPCR were performed and
  revealed a significant decrease in the protein and mRNA levels of RPL5 in siRPL5–1-
  and siRPL5–2-transfected human colon cancer cells, compared with those observed
  in siNC-transfected cells. The band intensities of RPL5 protein were quantified
  relative to β-Tubulin and normalized to the siNC sample. The blots were cut prior
  to hybridization with antibodies during blotting. The experiments were repeated
  three independent times with reproducible results. (***P < 0.001)
