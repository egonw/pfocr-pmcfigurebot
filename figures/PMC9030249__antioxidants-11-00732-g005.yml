caption: H2S blocks HDAC6-induced MyD88 deacetylation and NF-κB signaling activation
  in rRAFLS. (A) Immunoblot of the expression of HDAC6, Ac-α-tubulin, IκBα, p-IκBα,
  NF-κB (p65), and p-NF-κB (p65) in rRAFLS, which were transfected with vector (Vec)
  or HDAC6 overexpression plasmid OE-HDAC6 for 6 h and treated with NaHS (100 μM)
  or tubA (0.1 μM) for another 24 h. (B) After the above treatment, cell lysates were
  immunoprecipitated using anti-MyD88 antibody and the levels of MyD88, HDAC6, and
  acetylated (Ac) lysines in MyD88 were detected by Western blotting. Bars indicate
  the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. In (A), n = 3 in each group.
