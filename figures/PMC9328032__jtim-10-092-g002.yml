caption: 'Major three ethanol-oxidizing pathways in the liver. ADH is the major enzyme
  for breaking down ethanol to AA and reduced NAD+ (NADH) in hepatocytes. AA is the
  major toxic product of ethanol oxidization. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is another
  major inducible oxidoreductase expressed in the ER that oxidizes ethanol to AA and
  converts reduced NADPH to its oxidized form (NADP+) also causing ROS formation.
  Peroxisomal catalase is a minor ethanol metabolism pathway in the liver that normally
  degrades hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water but can also oxidize ethanol to AA. ER:
  endoplasmic reticulum; ALDH: aldehyde dehydrogenase; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; ADH: alcohol dehydrogenase; AA: acetaldehyde; ROS: Reactive
  oxygen species.'
