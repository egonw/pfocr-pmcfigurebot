caption: KEGG classification map of DEGs among IRF6+ induced group, iPSCs blank control
  group, and Salivary Gland like-Cells. A IRF6+ induced group vs iPSCs blank control
  group; B IRF6+ induced group vs Salivary Gland like-Cells; the ordinate is the name
  of the KEGG metabolic pathway, and the abscissa is the number of transcripts annotated
  to the pathway and its percentage The proportion of the total number of annotated
  transcripts
