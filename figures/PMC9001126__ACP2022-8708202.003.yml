caption: 'Characterization of umbilical cord-derived MSCs and MSC-exosomes. (a) Cell
  morphology of MSCs in single culture and MSCs was showing normal morphology in culture
  conditions (×100). (b, c) The differentiation potential of MSCs into two predominant
  lineages: adipogenesis and osteogenesis (×100). (d) The expression of surface markers
  of MSCs (HLA-DR, CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105) was detected by
  flow cytometry. (e) The morphology of MSC-exosomes was observed under transmission
  electron microscopy (scale bar = 200 nm). (f) Particle size distribution of MSC-exosomes
  was analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis. (g) The expression of markers of
  exosome MSCs (CD9, CD63, CD81, and Alix) was detected by western blot.'
