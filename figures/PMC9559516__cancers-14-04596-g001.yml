caption: Crosstalk Between RKIP and Snail. RKIP inhibits the MEK/ERK signaling pathway
  by interrupting the interaction between Raf and MEK, stopping the progression of
  the signal through the pathway. Snail is regulated downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway,
  upregulated through MEK/ERK signaling. In addition, Snail is an inhibitor of RKIP
  transcription through binding to the promoter region of RKIP.
