caption: MELK expression is elevated and associated with poor prognosis in ESCC. (A)
  Representative MELK immunohistochemical staining of ESCC and normal esophageal tissue
  (magnification, ×10 and ×40). Scale bars, 50 µm or 200 µm. (B) The histogram shows
  the percentage of MELK immunostaining in ESCC and normal esophageal tissue. ESCC
  tissues exhibited significantly higher MELK expression levels than normal esophageal
  tissue (Chi-square test, P<0.001). (C) Kaplan-Meier curves according to MELK expression
  status in ESCC. Patients with positive MELK expression had a shorter overall survival
  time than patients with negative MELK expression (log-rank test, P=0.045). (D-E)
  The relative expression of MELK in ESCC tissues and paired normal tissues were compared
  using GEO datasets, series GSE20347 and GSE23400. (F) The relative expression of
  MELK in ESCC tissues and normal tissues was compared using TCGA data. ***P<0.001.
