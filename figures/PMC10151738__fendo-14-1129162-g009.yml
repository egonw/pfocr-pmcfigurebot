caption: 'Effect of LMX in 3D-models of breast cancer. Images (A, B) and quantitation
  (A’, B’) of tumor spheroids surface area (A, A’) and alginate-based cultures (B,
  B’) generated in MCF-7 and Y537S cells, treated at time 0 with LMX (1 μM) or left
  untreated (CTR), for 7 days. The number of replicates is given as solid dots in
  the graphs. Significant differences with respect to the CTR sample were determined
  by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test: ** p-value < 0.01; * p-value<0.05. Scale
  bars equal to 50.0 mm.'
article_title: A functional genetic screen for metabolic proteins unveils GART and
  the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway as novel targets for the treatment of luminal
  A ERα expressing primary and metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma.
