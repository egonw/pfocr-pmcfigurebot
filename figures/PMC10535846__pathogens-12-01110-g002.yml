caption: Synergistic pathogenic effects of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum with respiratory
  pathogens. (A) P. gingivalis (P.g) induced the expression of platelet-activating
  factor receptor (PAFR), which promoted the invasion of respiratory epithelial cells
  by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.p). Mixed infection with both bacteria significantly
  increased the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-17 in the lungs, compared with S. pneumoniae
  infection alone. (B) P. gingivalis and P. aeruginosa (P.a) co-cultures can mutually
  invade respiratory epithelial cells, although P. gingivalis inhibited P. aeruginosa-induced
  apoptosis via the STAT3 signaling pathway during the early stage of co-infection.
  (C) F. nucleatum (F.n) and P. aeruginosa co-aggregate to form more complex biofilms
  and jointly invade respiratory epithelial cells. Co-infection of the two species
  effectively increased the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the lungs.
