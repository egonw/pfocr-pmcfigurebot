caption: RACK1 enhances the glycolysis in cervical cancer cells. (A) Common differential
  metabolites in the metabolic pathway of the supernatant of shRACK1/MS751 and shRACK1/SiHa
  cells. () Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; () Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis;
  () glycolysis/gluconeogenesis; () Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; () glycine,
  serine and threonine metabolism; () arginine and proline metabolism; () valine,
  leucine and isoleucine degradation; () butanoate metabolism; () pyruvate metabolism;
  () glutathione metabolism. (B) Effect of RACK1 on glucose uptake and lactate production.
  (C) Effect of RACK1 on the expression of the AKT/mTOR pathway, GLUT1, HK2, PKM2,
  LDHA, E-cadherin and N-cadherin, as evaluated using western blot analysis (left
  panel), with the protein bands assessed (right panel). (D) Effect of RACK1 on the
  mRNA expression of the GLUT1, HK2, PKM2, LDHA, E-cadherin and N-cadherin, as evaluated
  using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis. All data were obtained from
  three independent experiments. The data of two groups were analyzed using the Student's
  t-test and the data of more than two groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and
  are presented as the mean Â± SD. Data were compared with the shNON group (*P<0.05,
  **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001). RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase 1; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; HK2, hexokinase 2; LDHA, lactate
  dehydrogenase A; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2.
