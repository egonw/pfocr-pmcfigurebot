caption: 'A hallmark of ccRCC is the accumulation of cholesterol, cholesterol esters,
  and other lipids collected in intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). LD-associated
  proteins, PLIN2 and HILPDA, are overexpressed in ccRCC, regulate lipid storage,
  and enrich lipids that contain polyunsaturated fatty-acyl side chains. Cholesterol
  arrives in RCC cells through direct uptake from the diet and can be acquired through
  receptors: very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) and scavenger receptor
  B1 (SR-B1). Once lipoprotein binds to its receptor, it forms an endosome within
  the membrane, which translocates into cells. Following internalization and transport
  into the lysosome, the cholesterol ester is hydrolyzed by lysosomal acid lipase
  (LAL) and upregulated in ccRCC to release the free cholesterol. To protect cells
  from the toxic effects of high free-cholesterol levels resulting from LAL hydrolysis,
  ACAT re-esterifies free cholesterol with FAs for storage inside the cell. High levels
  of CE in RCC tumors result from increased activity of this enzyme. Cholesterol de
  novo synthesis in ccRCC is reduced because of decreased levels of HMG-CoA reductase.
  Therefore, cholesterol accumulation in ccRCC is likely the result of increased uptake
  rather than excessive biosynthesis from acetate. SREBPs are transcription factors
  that regulate enzymes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Once
  inside the nucleus, they bind to the promoter regions of SREBP target genes and
  initiate the expression of enzymes involved in FA, TG, and cholesterol synthesis
  and uptake. SETD8 is stabilized by deubiquitination mediated by ubiquitin-specific
  protease 17 (USP17) and modulates the transcription of SREBP1 as a direct target
  by methylating the 20th lysine of histone-4 with enormous effects on lipogenesis.
  The long-chain fatty acid transferase CPT1A is decreased in ccRCC clinical samples
  and cell lines compared to normal samples. HIFs are responsible for inhibiting CPT1A
  expression, reducing FA transport into mitochondria, and rerouting FA to LDs for
  storage. CPT1A deficiency promotes the expression of two members of class B scavenger
  receptors, CD36 and SRB1, leading to increased cholesterol absorption and intracellular
  lipid accumulation. CD36 and SRB1 are members of class B scavenger receptors, which
  promote lipid and cholesterol uptake. Elongation and desaturation are the main steps
  of the de novo synthesis of long-chain FAs (LC-FAs). The length and degree of unsaturation
  are determinants of FA function and metabolic fate. Palmitate (16:0) is the main
  product of de novo lipogenesis. It can be elongated and desaturated through the
  activity of SCD1 and ELOVLs to generate additional SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs. ccRCC
  cell lines upregulate SCD1 and HIF-2α, and SCD1 had synergistic effects in sustaining
  cancer cell survival and migration. These effects were due to a positive feedback
  loop between HIF-2α and SCD1, mediated by PI3K/Akt pathway activation.'
