caption: 'The effect of storax on the expression of type I and III collagen in the
  myocardium of ISO-induced AMI rats. (A) Representative images of myocardial type
  I and III collagen immunofluorescence staining in each group of rats. Type I collagen
  immunofluorescence staining was shown in pink, type III collagen immunofluorescence
  staining was shown in green and DAPI nuclear staining was shown in blue (scale bar
  = 50 μm). (B) Quantitative analysis of collagen type I. (C) Quantitative analysis
  of collagen type III. (D) Quantitative analysis of the ratio of collagen I/III.
  Results are presented as mean ± SD (n = 4). One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  post hoc test: ## p < 0.01 vs. vehicle group.'
