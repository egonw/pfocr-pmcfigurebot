caption: 'Functional enrichment analysis in TARGET cohort. A A circle graph showing
  the results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Red nodes: Up-regulated in high
  expression of DIO3OS groups; Blue nodes: Down-regulated in high expression of DIO3OS
  groups. The blue or red color of the Z-score represents the activated or suppressed
  pathways in functional enrichment analysis. Red: Activated pathway; Blue: Suppressed
  pathway. B A chord plot showing the results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis.
  The blue or red color of the LogFC represents gene expression between samples. Red:
  Up-regulated; Blue: Down-regulated. C A function enrichment network. Red nodes:
  genes; Blue Nodes: functional terms. D A bubble plot of GSEA enrichment analysis
  in TARGET cohort. p < 0.05. E TGF-β signaling pathway was significant enrichment
  using GSEA enrichment analysis in TARGET cohort'

  via activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway: a potential diagnostic and immunotherapeutic
  target for osteosarcoma.'
