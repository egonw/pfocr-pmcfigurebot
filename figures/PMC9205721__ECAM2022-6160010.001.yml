caption: 'SS extract suppresses LPS-induced NO production without toxicity. (a) Effects
  of the SS extract (SS) on LPS-induced NO production, determined by the nitrite assay.
  (b) Cytotoxicity of the SS extract (SS) in RAW 264.7 cells under experimental conditions
  identical to the nitrite assay. Cytotoxicity was determined by the crystal violet
  (left) and the CCK-8 (right) assays. The bars represent the mean ± standard deviation
  (SD). ∗: P < 0.05, ∗∗: P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗: P < 0.001 compared with the indicated
  group. SS, Sargassum siliquastrum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NO, nitric oxide.'
