caption: 'Metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
  and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). AA (A through D), EPA (E) and DHA (F) metabolic
  pathways. AA metabolic pathways were further classified by responsible enzymes:
  cyclooxygenase (COX, A), lipoxygenase (LOX, B), cytochrome P450 (CYP, C), or enzyme-independent
  oxidation (D). A black-filled circle represents a lipid metabolite which was detected
  in the present study, while an open circle represents a metabolite which was measured
  but not detected. A dot represents a metabolite which was not measured in the present
  study. A black square represents an enzyme responsible for the oxidation.'
