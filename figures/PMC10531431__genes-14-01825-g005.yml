caption: '(a) Two-way hierarchical clustering of DEGs enriched in photosynthesis pathways
  (Ko00195) based on log2FC values. KEGG pathway map of the DEGs enriched in photosynthesis-antenna
  proteins (Ko00195). The red boxes are for the representation of enriched DEGs in
  photosynthesis. (b) The pathway showed increased expression of DEGs for photosystem
  II, chlorophyll, antenna proteins, etc., in the β-alanine-treated seedlings from
  A1 vs. A3 treatment as compared to A1(CK). β-alanine solution in different concentrations
  used were as follows: A1(CK) = 0 mM, A2 = 10 mM, A3 = 25 mM, A4 = 50 mM, and A5
  = 100 mM; 1, 2, and 3 with the treatments represent the replicates.'
