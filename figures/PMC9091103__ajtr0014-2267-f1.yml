caption: Confirmation of TAM-resistant BC cell line. A. Cell viability measured using
  the MTT assay. B. Western blotting demonstrated that the drug resistance-related
  transport proteins were higher expressed in MCF-7/TAM. C. Flow cytometry assay illustrated
  that MCF-7 had higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared to MCF-7/TAM upon treatment
  with 5 μM TAM. All data are represented as mean ± SD. Each experiment was conducted
  in triplicate. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
