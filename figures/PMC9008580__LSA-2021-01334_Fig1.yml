figure_title: Human LUAD display distinctive hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP)
  up-regulation
caption: (A) Schematic representation of the HBP. (B) The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis
  of HBP enzymes in LUAD and LUSC paired nontumor (N) and tumor (T) tissue samples,
  presented as Log2-transformed RSEM-normalized count. ****P < 0.0001, **P < 0.01,
  ns, nonsignificant (Mann–Whitney). (C) Western blotting of GFAT1 in LUAD and LUSC
  paired nontumor (N) and tumor (T) tissue samples. Actin is used as a loading control.
  (D) Abundance of UDP-HexNAc and GlcNAc-6P in LUAD and LUSC paired nontumor (N) and
  tumor (T) tissue samples, presented as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC)
  of compound of interest/AUC of internal standard. *P < 0.05 (Wilcoxson test, n =
  6 independent experiments, mean ± SEM).Source data are available for this figure.
