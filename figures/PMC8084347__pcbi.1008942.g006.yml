figure_title: Integration of pharmacological and genetic screens reveals consistent
  metabolic pathway vulnerabilities in adherent RPMI cell lines
caption: A) Schematic outlining approach to identify drug targets and genetic dependencies
  that are commonly increased or decreased with metabolic pathway activity. Significance
  was assessed by permutation testing combined with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction.
  176 significant associations of 187,818 gene+drug:metabolic pathway combinations
  passed the FDR threshold of 0.01 ( and  Tables). B-E) Scatter plots of four drug
  response and CRISPR gene dependencies associated with metabolic pathway activity.
  The gene target of each drug is listed below the drug name. F) Schematic outlining
  a filtering approach used to identify common pathway-level vulnerabilities in Genetic
  PDEA and Pharmacologic PDEA. G-I) Mountain plots and leading edge drugs and genes
  from the three common pathway vulnerabilities are shown.
