caption: IL-22 accelerated the tumor growth in the xenograft models. A549 cells were
  subcutaneously injected into the right armpit of BALB/c nude mice. When the tumor
  volumes almost reached 50-100 mm3, these mice were randomly divided into two groups.
  Each group of mice was injected with IL-22 (4 μg, daily; five days per week) or
  vehicle alone (n = 5). (a) The tumor volumes of mice were determined every three
  days after the onset of treatment. (b, c) Finally, these mice were sacrificed under
  anesthesia. Then, the entire tumor was resected, and the weight of the tumor was
  measured. (d, e) Subsequently, the harvested tumors were lysed, and western blot
  analysis was performed for p-AKT, AKT, p-p38, p38, p-ERK, ERK, p-STAT3, and STAT3.
  The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The significant differences
  were compared with the controls and were indicated as ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
