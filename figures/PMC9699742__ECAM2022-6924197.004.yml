caption: 'GJD''s effect on Ras/ERK1/2 signaling mRNA expression in the left ventricular
  tissue. (a) mRNA expression of TGF-beta 1, (b) mRNA expression of Ras, (c) mRNA
  expression of ERK1/2, and (d) mRNA expression of C-Fos (n = 3). Values are means ± SD.
  Control: WKY (Wistar–Kyoto rats), model: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs),
  GJD-L: SHR received GJD low dose, GJD-M: SHR received GJD medium dose, GJD-H: SHR
  received GJD high dose, and CAPT: SHR received captopril. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  and ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. control. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 vs. model.'
