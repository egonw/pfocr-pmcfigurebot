caption: Aborted pollen grains and abnormal degradation of tapetum in ospdt1 anthers.
  A, Plant phenotypes at the seed maturation stage. B, Spikelets without lemma before
  anthesis. C and D, Pollen grains at Stage 12 stained by I2-KI. E–T, Transverse sections
  of anthers. E–H and M–P, Anthers were obtained from the WT at Stages 7, 8a, 8b,
  9, 10, 11, 12, and 14, respectively. I–L and Q–T, Anthers were obtained from the
  ospdt1 at Stages 7, 8a, 8b, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14, respectively. dM, degraded microspore;
  Dy, dyad cell; E, epidermis; En, endothecium; mP, mature pollen; MMC, microspore
  mother cell; Msp, microspore; T, tapetum; Tds, tetrads. Bars, 10 cm in (A), 2 mm
  in (B), 30 µm in (C) and (D), and 10 µm in (E–T).
