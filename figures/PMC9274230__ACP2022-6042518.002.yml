caption: 'Sunitinib inhibited the expression of snail. Western blot analysis was carried
  out to detect the protein expression of snail, vimentin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin
  in ectopic cells of two groups and normalized to GAPDH. The expression of vimentin,
  N-cadherin, and β-catenin between two groups was no statistical significance (P
  > 0.5), but the expression of snail decreased significantly (∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001). The
  date in the figure was expressed by mean ± SEM, and comparison between two groups
  was analyzed by t-test. The experiment was repeated three times independently. NS:
  no significance.'
