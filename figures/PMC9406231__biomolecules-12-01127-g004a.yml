caption: YTHDF3 mediates Cyp18a1 mRNA degradation in the ecdysone pathway. (A) Reducing
  the Cyp18a1 mRNA half-life by overexpressing YTHDF3 in BmN cells. (B) Relative firefly
  luciferase activity. (C) mRNA level of Cyp18a1. Values are mean ± s.d. of n = 4
  independent experiments. Two-tailed Student’s t-tests were used (** p < 0.01).
