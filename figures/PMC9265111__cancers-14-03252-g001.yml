caption: 'Single gene alteration leads to differential drug responses. (A) CRC-Panel
  DNA Sequencing of two representative sibling PDOs differing in SMAD4 mutational
  status (R4wt and R1R361H) (Variant allele frequencies (VAF) are shown). (B) Doubling
  times of R4wt and R1R361H. The cell density was measured on day 2, 3, 5, and 7 by
  measuring cellular ATP content using Cell Titer Glo® assay. Results from four independent
  experiments were combined (one-way ANOVA * p < 0.05). (C) Drug response curves of
  R4wt and R1R361H treated with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). (D) Scheme of the MAPK signaling
  pathway with interruption of signal transduction due to small molecules (mRTK-inhibitor:
  regorafenib, BRAF-inhibitor: dabrafenib, MEK-inhibitors: cobimetinib, trametinib,
  selumetinib, and ERK-inhibitor: ulixertinib). (E) Drug response curves of R4wt and
  R1R361H treated daily for 4 days with small molecules targeting the MAPK signaling
  pathway. Cell sensitivity in three biological and four technical replicates was
  defined according to IC50 values in relation to the maximal plasma concentrations
  (cmax), which are indicated for each drug with dotted lines. In all panels: Nonlinear
  curve fit, comparison of best-fit values, extra sum-of-squares F Test p < 0.05.
