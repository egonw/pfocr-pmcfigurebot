caption: 'Effect of exercise and/or MET on makers of oxidative status in the liver
  tissue. (a) MDA enzyme activity level. (b) SOD enzyme activity level. (c) T-AOC
  enzyme activity level. (d) CAT enzyme activity level. (e) The superoxide dismutase-1
  (SOD1) immunohistochemical staining of liver tissue (magnification ×400, scale bar:

  ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. CON, #P < 0.05 vs. EX, ▲P < 0.05 vs. MET. All data
  are expressed as mean ± SEM; n = 8 − 10.'
