caption: 'M2-EVs inhibited cytokine production by mediating complex signaling networks.
  (A) An overview of miRNA contents within M2-EVs and the top 8 most abundant miRNAs
  are listed. (B) miRNA-gene network analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  based on differentially expressed genes. (C) Measurement of cytokine TNF-α and IL-6
  mRNA levels in LPS/IFN-γ-primed PMφ cotreated with M2-EVs and different miRNA inhibitors
  for 4 h. (D) Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK, STAT3
  and NF-κB in LPS/IFN-γ-primed PMφ cotreated with M2-EVs and miRNA inhibitors for
  1 h. (E) Quantification of the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK, STAT3 and NF-κB
  in different groups (n = 3; ⁎⁎p < 0.01, ⁎p<0.05 vs CON group; ##p<0.01 vs LPS group).
  (F) Western blot analysis of HGF, IL-10, SOD2, TGFβ1 and TSG101 protein expression
  in M2 cells and EVs.'
