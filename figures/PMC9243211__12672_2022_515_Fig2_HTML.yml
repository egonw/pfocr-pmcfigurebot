caption: CD155 expression levels in EC are upregulated after X-ray irradiation. A,
  B Analysis of CD155 expression levels in Eca109 and Kyse510 cultured cells after
  X-ray irradiation. A mRNA levels were analyzed using RT-PCR. B Protein levels were
  measured using western blot analysis. C Changes in the expression of γ-H2AX were
  detected by western blotting when the esophageal cancer cell lines were irradiated
  at 6 Gy within 24 h. D The expression of CD155 was detected via western blotting
  after the addition of the ATM inhibitor, KU55933. E Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis
  of CD155 protein expression in tumors of irradiated and non-irradiated nude mice.
  F Statistical analysis of IHC results presented in E. Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001
article_title: CD155 promotes radioresistance and malignancy of esophageal cancer
  by regulating Hippo-YAP pathway.
