caption: 'Influence of oxycodone on mifepristone‐induced human endometrial stromal
  cell (hEndoSC) damage. hEndoSCs were exposed to various concentrations of oxycodone
  (1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 μg/mL) for the indicated times. (A) Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium
  (MTT) assay for cell viability. (B) Cell injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) release. hEndoSCs were treated with mifepristone, followed by treatment with
  1, 5, or 10 μg/mL oxycodone for 24 h. (C) The viability of hEndoSCs was detected
  using the MTT assay. (D) Apoptosis of hEndoSCs was determined using flow cytometry
  (FCM). (E) Quantification of apoptotic cells. (F) Detection of Caspase3 activity.
  (G) Western blot analysis of cleaved‐Caspase3. (H) Quantification of cleaved‐Caspase3
  expression. The enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay was applied to assess tumor necrosis
  factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin‐β (IL‐β), and IL‐6 (I–K) expression in the different
  groups. N = 3. **p < .01 versus Control; #, ##p < .05, .01 versus the mifepristone
  group. Experiments were repeated three times, and the data were presented as means ± SD.'
