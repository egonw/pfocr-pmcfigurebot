caption: Tregs are induced by MDSCs, TAMs and TANs via the production of IL-10 and
  CCL2 They determine a polarization of DCs towards an immature immunosuppressive
  phenotype resulting in an impaired antigen presentation and determining an immune-tolerant
  microenvironment. In addition, IL-10 induces a polarization of CD4+ T cells towards
  Th2 response. TGF-β, which is produced by CCA cells and TAMs, play a central role
  in immunotolerance by enhancing activity of Tregs and via the inhibition of CD8+
  T cells. TAMs-derived VEGF reduces CD8+ T cells activity by inducing their FasL-mediated
  killing. CCA cancer stem cells are able to induce TAMs polarization towards a tumor-promoting
  phenotype, on the other hand activated TAMs could stimulate CCA cells proliferation
  via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. CCA-derived CXCL9 enhance NK cells recruitment, thus
  resulting in an improved immune response.
