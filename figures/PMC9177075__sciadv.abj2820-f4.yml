figure_title: Single-cell transcriptomic clustering of CAR T cells identifies comparable
  functional immune profiles between CR and RL patients, except for TH2 function
caption: (A) UMAP reclustering of CAR+ cells from CR and RL patients and the top three
  dominant genes defining each cluster. (B) Expression of IL4, IL5, and IL13 in each
  identified cluster. (C) Comparison of cell proportion in particular cluster between
  CR and RL patients. The P values were calculated with Mann-Whitney test. ns., not
  significant. Scatter plots show means ± SEM. (D) Distribution feature plot of functional
  genes on the UMAP. (E) Canonical signaling pathway comparison between all the identified
  clusters. DEGs of each cluster are used to identify the biological pathways. A statistical
  quantity, called z score, is computed and used to characterize the activation level.Z
  score reflects the predicted activation level (z < 0, inhibited; z > 0, activated;
  z ≥ 2 or z ≤ − 2 can be considered significant). (F) Single-cell expression level
  violin plot of all key immunologically relevant cytokine genes from CAR+ cells in
  each patient.
