caption: Targets and pathways enrichment analyses. (A) The 3D conformer of DHCE. (B)
  Venn diagram of 292 DHCE targets (left) and 1208 gastric cancer targets (right).
  Eighty common targets (middle) between DHCE and gastric cancer were identified as
  candidate targets for DHCE in the treatment of gastric cancer. (C) The PPI network
  of the 80 candidate targets. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the 80 candidate
  targets. The size of dots indicates the number of genes in the KEGG pathways.
