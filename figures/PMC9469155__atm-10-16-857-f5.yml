caption: KEGG analysis on target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. (A) KEGG
  enrichment of target genes between pre-irradiation and exposure to 5 Gy 60Co. (B)
  KEGG enrichment of target genes between pre-irradiation and exposure to 10 Gy 60Co.
  This figure displays signaling pathways on Y-axes and degree of enrichment on X-axes.
  The larger the dot, the more genes involved in this pathway. The greener the color,
  the higher the significance of enrichment. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes; miRNAs, microRNAs; 60Co, cobalt-60.
