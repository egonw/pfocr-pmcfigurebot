caption: 'Enhancing the extracellular electron transfer efficiency of S. oneidensis
  MR-1. (A) Schematic of the extracellular electron transfer pathway in S. oneidensis
  MR-1. S. oneidensis MR-1 has two major electron transport mechanisms: the direct
  electron transport pathway based on c-type cytochromes and the indirect electron
  transport pathway based on flavin shuttles. Flavin electron shuttling accounts for
  about 75% of extracellular electron transfer to electrode. Therefore, we further
  integrated the flavin synthesis gene clusters cloning from lactic acid bacteria
  into the S7 site of the genome of (B) MR-1/sucrose or MR-1/starch to obtain the
  engineered strains with stronger extracellular electron transfer ability. (C) Comparison
  of the fluorescence intensities of flavins synthesized by S. oneidensis MR-1, MR-1/Sucrose-Rib
  and MR-1/Starch-Rib in LB medium. Inset: the photos of three cultures supernatant.
  Left: MR-1. Center: MR-1/sucrose-Rib. Right: MR-1/starch-Rib. The current densities
  of the MECs inoculated with S. oneidensis MR-1 and engineered strain when (D) glucose,
  (E) fructose, (F) sucrose or (G) starch was used as the sole carbon source. HMP:
  hexose monophosphate pathway. Data in C, D, E, F and G are shown as mean Â± s.d.
  for n = 3 biologically independent samples.'
