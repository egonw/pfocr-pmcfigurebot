caption: Simplified overview of the 2′-FL pathway in the E. coli production strain.
  The general modifications required for efficient 2′-FL synthesis include the expression
  of a heterologous fucosyl-transferase (encoded by futC), lacZ deletion to avoid
  breakdown of lactose, overexpression of the colanic acid pathway genes for efficient
  production of GDP-L-fucose, and the deletion of wcaJ to avoid further conversion
  of GDP-L-fucose to colanic acid. In addition to 2′-FL, the byproduct difucosyllactose
  (DFL) can be formed by the addition of a second fucose unit. Its formation rate
  is 2′-FL relative and dependent on the kinetics and rates of the reactions described
  above.
