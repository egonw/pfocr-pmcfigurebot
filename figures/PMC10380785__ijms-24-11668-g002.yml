caption: '(A). The three canonical monolignols (left: p-coumaryl, coniferyl and synapyl
  alcohol) are structurally very related to other lignols (right) produced through
  the same phenylpropanoid pathway (see ). Of note, the catechol groups in the caffeyl
  alcohol (producing C units in lignin) and 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol allow for a
  different radical/oxidative reactivity. (B). A few flavonoids (based on a polyphenolic
  α,β-unsaturated cyclic ketone structure (chromone); left) and hydroxystilbenes and
  their glycolides (1,3-diphenolic ring linked to a phenolic, catecholic or 2-methoxyphenolic
  ring through an ethylene residue; right) have been found to be monolignols too and
  are produced through the acetate/malonate polyketide pathway. Taxonomically, tricin
  is a flavon; dihydrotricin and naringenin are flavanones, and naringenin chalcone
  is—as suggested by the name—a chalcone. (C). Two hydroxycinammamides behave as monolignols.
  They are ferulic acid derivatives, which derive from the amino acid metabolic pathway.
  (D). Flavonolignans (left of the vertical dashed line) and stilbenolignans (right
  of the dashed line) are low MW products of reaction between a flavonoid (e.g., tricin)
  or a hydroxystilbene (e.g., piceatannol) and a phenylpropanoid lignol, whose sub-structures
  are separated by a red dashed line in the panel. While typical mechanisms for such
  reactions are listed in . The reader is addressed elsewhere for more comprehensive
  lists of flavono- [] and stilbenolignan [] structures.'
