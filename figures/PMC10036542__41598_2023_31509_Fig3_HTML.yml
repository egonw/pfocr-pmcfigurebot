caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of Spirosoma montaniterrae DY10 and Escherichia
  coli. (A) The significantly enriched terms of KEGG pathways of Spirosoma montaniterrae
  in varying time points. (B) The significantly enriched terms of KEGG pathways of
  Escherichia coli in varying time points. (C,D) Variation over time of significantly
  changed genes among genes related to homologous recombination, mismatch repair and
  Nitrogen metabolism processes in Spirosoma montaniterrae.
