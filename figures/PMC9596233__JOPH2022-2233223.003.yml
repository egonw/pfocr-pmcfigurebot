caption: 'Intracellular IP3 and DAG levels in RPE cells. The intracellular levels
  of IP3 and DAG were measured by ELISA. The data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 3).
  An LSD test following one-way ANOVA was performed. ∗P < 0.05 vs. control cells;
  #P < 0.05 vs. blue light-treated cells; &P < 0.05 vs. blue light + chloroquine-treated
  cells; ▲P < 0.05 vs. blue light + A2E-treated cells.'
