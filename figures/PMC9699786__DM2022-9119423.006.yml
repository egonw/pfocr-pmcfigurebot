caption: HUVECs may induce the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells
  via the S1P-S1PR pathway. (a) HUVECs and HepG2 cells were cocultured for 1 to 4
  days, and a CCK-8 assay was used to determine HepG2 cells proliferation. HUVECs
  and HepG2 cells were cocultured for 24 h, and their migration (b) and invasion (c)
  were measured. HUVECs and HepG2 cells were cocultured for 1 to 4 days, and the S1P
  content (d) in the coculture system and the S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 protein expression
  (e) in HepG2 cells were measured. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the noncoculture
  or control group.
