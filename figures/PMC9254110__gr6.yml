caption: 'Breast cancer cells with FOXF2-regulated stemness sensitize to Wnt signaling
  pathway inhibitor.A and B, Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor XAV939 (10 μM) or ICG001
  (10 μM) was used to inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway in the indicated cells. A
  and B, the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells which differentiate into osteoclasts
  (A) and adipocytes (B) were evaluated by osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation
  assays, and the number of calcium nodules and the ratio of Oil Red O+ cells were
  calculated. C–E, a total of 1 × 107 T-47D-FOXF2-Luc or T-47D-Vector-Luc cells were
  injected into the left ventricle of female NOD/SCID mice (n = 5 per group). A total
  of 3 × 106 MDA-MB-231-Luc-shFOXF2 or MDA-MB-231-Luc-shControl cells were inoculated
  into abdominal mammary fat pad of female NOD/SCID mice (n = 5 each group). The mice-bearing
  tumors formed by T-47D-FOXF2-Luc or MDA-MB-231-Luc-shFOXF2 cells were treated with
  ICG001 (20 mg/kg) by i.p. injection three times a week for 7 weeks starting on the
  11th day after initial inoculation. Bioluminescence images of xenograft mice on
  day 45 (T-47D-Luc) or 50 (MDA-MB-231-Luc) after indicated cell inoculation (C).
  The bone and visceral metastases in xenograft mice injected with indicated cells
  was identified by H&E staining and luciferase immunohistochemical staining (D).
  The rate of bone and visceral metastases in each group was analyzed (E). ND: not
  detected. ∗, p < 0.05 compared with control cells or control mice. # and &, p <
  0.05 compared with FOXF2-overexpressing or FOXF2-depleted cells (# for shFOXF2#1
  and & for shFOXF2#2) and the mice-bearing tumors from T-47D-FOXF2-Luc or MDA-MB-231-Luc-shFOXF2
  cells, respectively. Arrow points to metastatic foci.'
