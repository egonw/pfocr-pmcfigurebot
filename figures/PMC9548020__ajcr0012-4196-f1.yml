caption: Graphs comparing the HNCSC and non-HNCSC subpopulations for all seven samples.
  (A) The number on the vertical axis means the mean of the percentage of the cells
  that was sorted; (B) comparison of the percentage of the cells sorted related to
  CD44/CD117/CD133 and ALDH cell sorting criteria; (C) comparison of the percentage
  of the cells sorted between oral cavity, pharynx and larynx primary subsites; (D)
  the number on the vertical axis is the mean of the number of the colonies formed
  compared of the seven primary tumors; (E) colony forming after 120 h in 40× magnification;
  (F) comparison of the colonies formed between oral cavity, pharynx and larynx primary
  subsites; and (G) number of the colonies formed compared between CD44/CD117/CD133
  and ALDH cell sorting criteria. *P<0.01, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. to non-HNCSCs
  group; a = P<0,001 vs. to Pharynx in HNCSCs; b = P<0.001 vs. Larynx in HNCSCs; c
  = P<0.001 vs. Oral cavity in HNCSCs; d = P<0,001 vs. to Pharynx in non-HNCSCs; e
  = vs. Oral cavity in non-HNCSCs; f = P<0.001 vs. ALDH sorting in HNCSCs; g = P<0.001
  vs. ALDH in non-HNCSCs; h = P<0.001 vs. to CD44/CD117/CD133 in HNCSCs group by two-way
  ANOVA statistical analysis data.
