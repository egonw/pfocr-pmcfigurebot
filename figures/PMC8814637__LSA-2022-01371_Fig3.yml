figure_title: Host responses to SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV infection
caption: (A) Top 100 host proteins following average viral translation and proteome
  level profiles over time. Average profiles were calculated using the Z-scored mean
  abundance of all detected viral proteins. Individual host protein profiles were
  compared with the average viral profile and scored using Pearson correlation. (B)
  Venn diagram showing the number of overlapping proteins from the top 100 proteins
  list for each cell type and viral infection. SARS-CoV-2–infected PTC and DTC show
  75 shared proteins predominantly associated with immune response. (C) MX1 protein
  profile across different time points post-infection of PTC and DTC infected either
  with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. Represented are log2 fold-changes and corresponding
  P-values (n = 3 independent biological replicates). Small P-values were rounded
  up to P < 0.0001. Exact P-values are shown in Table S1. (D) Row-wise hierarchical
  clustering analysis for host proteins detected in both viral infections for translatome
  (left) and proteome (right). Selected clusters are indicated (for complete clustering
  refer to ). Each row represents the mean log2 fold-change (FC) of one protein upon
  infection compared with control. (E, F, G) Pathway enrichment analyses using DAVID
  web-tool (see Table S3). (E) Reactome pathways analysis for cluster 1 (T-C1 and
  P-C1) proteins in translatome and proteome. Proteins in this cluster are primarily
  increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathways with P-value ≤ 0.05 in either subset
  are shown. (F) Disease pathway analysis for cluster 2 (T-C2 and P-C2), defined by
  increased translation or protein abundance upon MERS-CoV infection. (G) Reactome
  pathway analysis for proteins belonging to proteome clusters P-C2, P-C3 and P-C4.
  This subset of proteins was distinctively increased in MERS-CoV–infected PTC and
  DTC as well as SARS-CoV-2–infected PTC. Pathways with false discovery rate <0.05
  are shown.
