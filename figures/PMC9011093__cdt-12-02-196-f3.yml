caption: 'Gene expression profile by RNA-sequencing of hVICs cultured with or without
  Gal-3. (A) Volcano map of DEGs in C versus Gal-3 [log10 (Gal-3/C); up-regulation:
  79 genes and down-regulation: 82 genes]; (B) heatmap for common DEGs with group
  clusters; (C) KEGG pathway enrichment, where orange dots indicate the degree of
  enrichment [Q value (−log10)]; (D) transcription factor enrichment, yellow (deep)
  color indicates the degree of enrichment [Q value (−log10)]. Gal-3, galectin-3;
  hVICs, human aortic valve interstitial cells; DEGs, differentially expressed genes.'
article_title: Galectin-3 promotes calcification of human aortic valve interstitial
  cells via the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.
