caption: A schematic diagram showing analysis performed in this study. Network pharmacology
  methods were used to identify effective targets of Celastrol through TCMSP database,
  Swiss Target database, and Batman-TCM database. Potential effective targets related
  to DCM were then identified using DisGeNET database, OMIM database, GeneCard database,
  and GEO database (GSE4745). Further, common targets of Celastrol and DCM were determined
  using a Venn diagram. STRING tool was used to construct PPI networks for targets
  of Celastrol and DCM, and visualization was done using Cytoscape 3.7.1. KEGG enrichment
  analysis was performed to explore signaling pathways of the drug and DCM that are
  implicated in energy reconstruction. The metabolic pathway level of each sample
  was quantified based on ssGSEA, and the relationship between major targets and energy
  metabolism was explored through Spearman correlation analysis. Experiments on animals
  were conducted to study alterations in signaling molecules.
