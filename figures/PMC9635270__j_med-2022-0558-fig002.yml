caption: Overexpression of HOXA10 enhanced proliferation in EC cells. (a) Real-time
  PCR showed HOXA10 mRNA level in Eca-109 and TE-1 cells. (b) Western blot showed
  HOXA10 protein level in Eca-109 and TE-1 cells. (c) CCK-8 assay revealed that the
  elevation of cell viability was caused by HOXA10 overexpression and inhibition of
  cell viability was induced by HOXA10 knockdown. (d) Clone formation assay determined
  that HOXA10 overexpression increased the colony number and HOXA10 knockdown suppressed
  the colony number. Each experiment repeated three times. **p  <  0.01, ***p  < 0 .001
  vs NC. @@p < 0.01, @@@p < 0.001 vs siNC.
