figure_title: Vascular cell-type specific perturbations in Alzheimer’s disease
caption: a, Proportion of cell types captured in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and no cognitive
  impairment individuals (NCI) (left). Proportion of BEC and pericyte subpopulations
  in AD and NCI (right) (n = 8 NCI, n = 9 AD, two-sided t-test; mean +/− s.e.m.).
  **BEC P = 0.002, **Pericyte P = 0.003, *P. fibroblast P = 0.0461.b, Immunohistochemical
  validation of a loss of vascular cell density in AD (number of Hoechst+ nuclei within
  Collagen IV+ vasculature). Scale bar = 50 microns (n = 5 NCI and AD, nested two-sided
  t-test; mean +/− s.e.m.). Yellow arrows denote example vascular nuclei.c, Differentially
  expressed gene (DEG) counts for each cell type in AD. The intensity of the blue
  color and the size of the squares are proportional to entry values.d, Enriched biological
  pathways from AD differentially expressed genes in pericytes, smooth muscle cells,
  and perivascular fibroblast-like cells, plotted by Pathway Representation (in a
  given pathway, what proportion of all members are DEGs) and Significance (-log10P)
  of pathway enrichment.e, Enriched biological pathways from genes upregulated in
  AD APOE4 carriers in capillary and venous endothelial cells (P value < 0.05, cumulative
  hypergeometric test).f, Venn diagram comparing DEG BECs in human AD samples compared
  to those from the Thy1-hAPP T41BLon,Swe amyloidosis mouse model. Note that only
  genes with human-mouse orthologs are shown, and that the absolute logFC threshold
  for calling DEGs in mouse APP BECs was lowered to 0.15 (by half) to ensure claims
  of limited overlap with human BECs were robust.
