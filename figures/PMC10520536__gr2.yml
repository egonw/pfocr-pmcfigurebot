caption: 'Effect of NET1 knockdown on TGF-β1-induced cardiac fibroblasts(A) mRNA change
  of NET1, n = 4, ∗p = 0.0286 TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl by Mann Whitney test. ∗∗p = 0.0084 TGF-β1 +
  si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1，∗p = 0.0360 vs. TGF-β1 + si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1 + NC by Kruskal-Wallis
  test.(B) mRNA of collagen I (COL1A1) was detected by qRT-PCR, n = 4, ∗p = 0.0286
  TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl by Mann Whitney test. ∗p = 0.0360 TGF-β1 + si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1，∗p

  image of cardiac fibroblasts stained with α-SMA antibody (Red) and NET1 antibody
  (Green). Scale bar: 50 μm, magnification 200×.(D) The migration of cardiac fibroblast
  was detected by scratch assay, n = 5, ∗p = 0.0452 TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl, ∗p = 0.0277 TGF-β1 +
  si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1, ∗p = 0.0452 TGF-β1 + si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1 + NC by Kruskal-Wallis
  test.(E) The proliferative ability of cardiac fibroblasts was detected by EdU kit.
  Scale bar: 50 μm, magnification 200×, n = 4, ∗p = 0.0313 TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl, ∗∗p =
  0.0075 TGF-β1 + si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1, ∗p = 0.0143 TGF-β1 + si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1 + NC
  by Kruskal-Wallis test.(F) The viability of cardiac fibroblasts was detected by
  MTT assay, n = 9, ∗p = 0.0465 TGF-β1 vs. Ctrl, ∗∗p < 0.0001 TGF-β1 + si-NET1 vs.
  TGF-β1, ∗∗p < 0.0001 TGF-β1 + si-NET1 vs. TGF-β1 + NC by Kruskal-Wallis test. For
  all statistical plots, the data are presented as mean ± SEM.'
