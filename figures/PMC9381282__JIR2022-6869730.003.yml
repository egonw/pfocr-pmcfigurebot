caption: 'rhALR treatment results in less interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration
  after renal I/R injury induction. Immunostaining of CD11b (a) and CD68 (b) in the
  extrarenal medulla of rats was induced by sham operation or I/R injury 24-72 h after
  surgery. Sections at 72 h are shown in (a, b) (magnification: ×200). 10 HPF cells
  were counted in each section. After the induction of renal I/R injury, the number
  of neutrophils and macrophages increased rapidly and reached the peak at 24 and
  72 h, respectively. Exogenous rhALR reduced neutrophils and macrophage infiltration
  at both time points. All data were presented as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05 vs. sham,
  #P < 0.05 vs. I/R+saline group.'
