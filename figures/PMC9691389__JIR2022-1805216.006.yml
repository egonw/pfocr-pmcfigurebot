caption: Overview of phagosome/endosome/autophagy-lysosome pathways in PBMCs from
  patients with decompensated cirrhosis. (a) The overview of phagosome/endosome/autophagy-lysosome
  pathways based on the expression levels of differentially expressed mRNAs. The figure
  was drawn according to the information from KEGG PATHWAY database. The molecules
  in red were upregulated in PBMCs from DCC patients, and the molecules in green were
  downregulated in PBMCs from DCC patients. (b) The overview of phagosome/endosome/autophagy-lysosome
  pathways according to the target genes of DE-lncRNAs and genes involved in RASEs.
  The molecules in blue were lncRNA target genes, and the molecules in yellow were
  genes involved in RASEs.
