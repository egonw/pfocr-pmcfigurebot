caption: The blunt-end dsRNA miR29b-1* mimic induces IFN response in cells and this
  response mediates the anti-viral effects of the oligo in A549 cells. (A) Agilent
  whole genome microarray analysis of gene expression changes in Qiagen miR29b-1*-transfected
  A549 cells in comparison to control cells, which were transfected with Qiagen non-targeting
  dsRNA siAllstar (10 nM). Shown is a pathway enrichment analysis of significantly
  (p-value ≤ 0.05) up-regulated and down-regulated functional pathways, the heatmap
  illustrating log2 values of gene expression changes for the indicated genes within
  the pathways. (B) A549 cells transfected with blunt-end miR29b-1* mimic (29b-1*,
  2.5 nM), but not those transfected with randomized miR29b-1* sequence mimic (Rand),
  secrete type I interferons. Clarified culture supernatants were collected from the
  cells at 24 h, 48 h, and 60 h post transfection and titrated on 293T indicator cells
  expressing Firefly luciferase under the type I IFN-inducible Mx1 promoter (jetPEI
  transfections). The y-axis shows normalized Firefly luciferase activities in cell
  extracts expressed as fold-changes in comparison to values obtained from untreated
  indicator cells. Indicated amounts of recombinant IFNα2 were used as controls. The
  bars represent mean values from three technical replicates with standard deviation.
  No RNA indicates culture supernatant from non-transfected A549 cells. Rand and miR29b-1*
  mimics were obtained from Qiagen. (C). The anti-viral effect of the blunt-end dsRNA
  miR29b-1* mimic is ablated in A549 IFNAR2-KO cells. miR29b-1*-transfected A549-IFNAR2
  knockout cells were infected with AdV-C5 and infection efficiencies were scored
  by immunostaining for the late virus protein VI. Infection index (left y-axis, bar
  plot) refers to the fraction of VI-positive cells over total number of cells analyzed
  (right y-axis, scatter plot) and v1, v2, and v3 to three different two-fold dilutions
  of input virus. The two technical replicates are shown separately. Grey bars represent
  infection index, red symbols cell numbers.
