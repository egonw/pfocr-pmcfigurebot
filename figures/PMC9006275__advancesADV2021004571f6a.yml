caption: 'Srsf2P95H/+ cells are sensitive to the CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib and the
  spliceosome inhibitor Pladienolide B. (A) The guide count for CDK6 sgRNA in Srsf2+/+
  and Srsf2P95H/+ cells over the course of the screen. (B) The cell-cycle stage distribution
  of Srsf2P95H/+ and Srsf2+/+ cells at day 18 after tamoxifen cessation. No statistical
  difference detected between P95H and WT cells. (C) Hoxb8 GM-CSF Srsf2P95H/+ cell
  lines and sorted primary Srsf2P95H/+ LKS+ cells are sensitive to palbociclib and
  Pladienolide B after 4 days of drug culture. Hoxb8 GM-CSF cell lines: n = 3 per
  genotype for roscovitine and Pladienolide B, n = 2 for palbociclib. Extra sum-of-squares
  F test. LKS+ cells, n = 1 per genotype. LKS+, linâˆ’ckit+Sca-1+.'
