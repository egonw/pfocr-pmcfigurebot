caption: 'Pyroptosis in lung cancer. Increased GSDMD contributes to the proliferation
  of NSCLC cells. However, many potent anti-tumor drugs, such as polyphyllin VI and
  cucurbitacin B, induce NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway-mediated pyroptosis.
  Meanwhile, p53 induces pyroptosis to attenuate the proliferation of NSCLC cells
  by activating the NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 signaling pathway. Additionally, chemotherapeutic
  drugs such as cisplatin and paclitaxel trigger caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis
  to eliminate NSCLC cells and lead to the switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis in
  lung cancer cells. Notably, caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis, which is mediated
  by cisplatin in normal tissues, contributes to the cisplatin-based side effects.
  Note: GSDMD, gasdermin D; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a caspase-activation and recruitment domain; GSDME,
  gasdermin E'
