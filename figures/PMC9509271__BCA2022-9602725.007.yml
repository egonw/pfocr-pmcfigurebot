caption: Apoptotic cell death induced by CuO-TiO2-Chitosan-Berbamine nanocomposites
  in K562 blood cancer cells after 24 hours. Fluorescence microscopy (Labomed, USA)
  was used to analyze the cells after dual-staining with AO/EtBr (1 : 1). A) Control;
  B) Doxorubicin-treated cells; C) CuO-TiO2-CS-Berbamine-treated cells. LA - Late
  Apoptosis; EA - Early Apoptosis; NC - Necrotic Cells; VC - Viable Cells.
