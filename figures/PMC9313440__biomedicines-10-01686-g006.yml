caption: The primary mechanisms of flavanones in the proliferation pathway. JAK—Janus
  kinase, a family of intracellular, non-receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce
  cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-STAT pathway; STAT—transcription factors;
  PI3K—phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; AKT—protein kinase B, a significant mediator
  of cell survival; mTOR—the mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κB—nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; COX-2—cyclooxygenase 2; Notch—the Notch signaling pathway,
  a highly conserved cell signaling system present in most animals.
