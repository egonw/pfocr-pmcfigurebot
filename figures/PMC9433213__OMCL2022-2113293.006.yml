caption: 'Ameliorative effects of curcumin on DHT-induced ER stress in ovarian GCs
  mediated via increasing of PI3K/AKT phosphorylation. (a, b) Western blot results
  showing the changes in the indicated proteins in GCs treated with DHT after incubation
  with LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor). (c, d) The p-IRE1α protein level in GCs treated
  with DHT, LY294002, and curcumin. (e, f) Changes in ER stress-related protein levels
  in GCs treated with DHT and LY294002 as detected by western blot. Three independent
  experiments were performed with similar results. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM.
