caption: Metabolic activation of sofosbuvir (GS-331077) through the intermediate nucleoside
  form. The steps are shown only briefly, as they are very similar to those for remdesivir,
  shown earlier (). The final triphosphate form mimics UTP and is recognized by RdRP
  to be incorporated in the product RNA in place of U, which results in transcription
  termination [,]. The corresponding CTP analog (triphosphate from PSI-6130), discussed
  below (), is also generated essentially by the same pathway [].
