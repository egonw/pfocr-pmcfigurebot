caption: Effects of BR and Pcz treatments on the total alkaloid contents (A) and bulbil
  yield (B). The bars with different letters are significantly different from each
  treatment (p < 0.05). Values are means of four replicates Â± SE. Proposed biosynthetic
  routes of ephedrine in P. ternata (C). Differentially expressed levels of unigenes
  related to ephedrine biosynthesis (D). Changes in expression level are represented
  by a change in color; blue indicates a lower expression level, whereas red indicates
  a higher expression level. All data shown reflect the average mean of three biological
  replicates.
