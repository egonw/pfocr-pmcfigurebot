caption: The expression profiles of genes involved in IMD, or Toll pathway induced
  by Poria cocos polysaccharides (PS). After the hemocoel injection of Bombyx mori
  larvae with PS (0.2 μg/larva), the mRNA levels of (A) Toll, (B) Imd, (C) Ceceropin
  D, (D) Gloverin1, (E) Myd88, and (F) spaetzle were detected by qRT-PCR. Two-way
  ANOVA/Tukey was conducted for statistical analysis. Asterisks indicate the levels
  of significant differences (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
article_title: Transcriptome analysis reveals immune and metabolic regulation effects
  of Poria cocos polysaccharides on Bombyx mori larvae.
