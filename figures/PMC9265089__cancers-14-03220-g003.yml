caption: AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent inhibition of tumor growth by biguanides.
  Supra-pharmacological concentrations of biguanides inhibit complex I, which increases
  AMP levels and leads to the activation of AMPK. Alternatively, metformin prevents
  the activation of NFkB pathway by inhibiting the translocation of NFkB to the nucleus.
  AMPK regulates DICER, cMyc, HIF1Î±, and Gli1 activity and inhibits mTOR complex,
  suppressing tumor growth. Biguanides also inhibit Rag GTPases to suppress mTOR signaling.
