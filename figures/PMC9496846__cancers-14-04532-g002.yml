caption: Z-score heat map showing baseline gene expression across 100 CCLE cell lines.
  Genes shown (rows) are those positively or negatively associated at p < 0.05 with
  the most sensitive versus least sensitive cell line quartiles for eribulin, vinorelbine
  and paclitaxel as indicated across the top of the heat map. The left and right sides
  of the y-axis show textual or visual representations of associations of genes with
  1, 2 or all 3 of the tested drugs.
