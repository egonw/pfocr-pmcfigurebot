caption: ALDOA promotes GC cell proliferation and growth of GC cells. A. The growth
  curves of AGS cells stably transfected with either control shRNA (NC) or ALDOA shRNA
  (KD). B. The growth curves of MKN45 cells stably transfected with either empty vector
  (VEC) or plasmids encoding human ALDOA (OE). C. Colony formation assay was performed
  to determine the growth of AGS cells (NC vs. KD). D. Colony formation assay was
  performed to determine the growth of MKN45 cells (VEC vs. OE). The bands were quantified
  and presented as the mean Â± SEM. E. Image of subcutaneous tumors derived from AGS
  cells (NC vs. KD) in nude mice (n = 4). F. The weight of subcutaneous tumors was
  shown. G. Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins in GC cell. **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001. The original Western blots are included in the .
