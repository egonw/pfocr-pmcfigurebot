caption: Functional clustering and enrichment analysis of differentially abundant
  proteins in HUVECs in response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure. (A,B) Volcano plots of the
  relative quantified protein groups showing a significantly high abundance of proteins
  in red (log2Fc ≥ 0.58 and −log10p-value ≥ 1.12 = p-value ≤ 0.05) and low abundance
  proteins in blue (log2Fc ≤ −0.58 and −log10p-value ≥ 1.12 = p-value ≤ 0.05). The
  gene names depicted in each plot were from proteins that presented the highest fold
  change or the lowest p values (p-value ≤ 0.001). Network representation of the enriched
  reactome pathways of the high (red) or low abundant (blue) protein clusters of SARS-CoV-2-exposed
  HUVEC samples after 48 h (C) or 120 h (E). Network representation of the enriched
  GO terms for biological processes of high (red) or low abundant (blue) protein clusters
  of SARS-CoV-2 exposed samples at 48 h (D) or 120 h (F). Nodes depict the enriched
  terms for pathways or biological processes. The connections between the nodes represent
  the shared proteins among them. Dots represent the main proteins associated with
  each biological process or pathway. The size of the nodes was directly proportional
  to the significance of the terms (corrected p-value ≤ 0.05, right-sided hypergeometric
  test, Bonferroni step-down FDR correction). Clustering and labeling of related GO
  biological processes or Reactome pathways were performed using AutoAnnotate. Black
  circles highlight enriched terms that indicate oxidative stress and/or endothelial
  dysfunction.
