caption: The structural components, types, and physiological role of mTOR signaling
  pathway. Upward and downward direction of arrows indicate the increase or decrease
  of process or substance. When growth factor stimulates TRK receptor then it triggers
  the downregulation of Ras, Raf Mek, Erk, IRS, P13k, PIR3, and Akt which ultimately
  cause inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 complex which ultimately inhibits lysosome biogenesis
  autophagy and upregulates the process of ribosome/mitochondria biogenesis and lipid/protein/nucleotide
  synthesis and energy metabolism by inhibiting Rheb. On the other hand, Rag A/B and
  Rag C/D cause the same effect by amino acids upregulation.
