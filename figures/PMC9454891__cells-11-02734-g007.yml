caption: Immunoblot analysis of apoptotic proteins in Hep3B cells after treatment
  with apigetrin. Apigetrin was used to treat cells at indicated concentrations. Cell
  lysates were subjected to western blot analysis using Bax, Bcl-xl, cleaved caspase
  3 and cleaved PARP primary antibodies. Expression levels of proteins were determined
  based on densitometry analysis results. They are presented as mean ± standard deviation
  (SD) from three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 vs. control, *** p < 0.001
  vs. control.
