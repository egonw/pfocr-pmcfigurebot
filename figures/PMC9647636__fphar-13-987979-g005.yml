caption: 'The TBK1/IKKε signaling node mediates TWEAK- and LPS-induced inflammation
  in cultured tubular cells and in vivo in the kidneys. (A,B,F) qRT-PCR assessed mRNA
  levels of ISGs and cytokines in MCT cells exposed to 100 g/ml TWEAK or 1 μg/ml LPS
  in the absence or presence of TBK1/IKKε inhibitor (50 μM amlexanox, AMX) added 1 h
  before stimuli. Oasl2 and Usp18 mRNA expression was evaluated at 24 h (A). Cxcl10,
  Ccl2 and Ccl5 transcription was assessed at 6 h (B) or 24 h (F). Values are Mean
  ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control vehicle-stimulated cells and #p ≤ 0.05 vs TWEAK or LPS-stimulated
  cells (n = 4). (C,D) Representative microphotographs of nuclear phosphorylated IRF3
  (pIRF3, green) (C) and p65 (green) (D) detected by immunofluorescence in MCT cells
  stimulated with TWEAK for 30 min in the absence or presence of AMX pretreatment
  for 1 h. Original magnification ×400. Scale bar 10 µM. (E) Representative western
  blot of pIκBα in cultured MCT cells stimulated with TWEAK in the same conditions
  as in D and (E) (G,H) Activation of TBK1/IKKε signaling in vivo. (G) TWEAK ip administration
  to mice with or without pretreatment with amlexanox (AMX) to evaluate the in vivo
  effects of TBK1/IKKε inhibition on TWEAK-induced kidney inflammation at 24 h. (H)
  The kidney expression of ISGs (Ifit1) and cytokines (Cxcl10, Ccl5) mRNA was assessed
  by qRT-PCR. *p ≤ 0.05 vs control vehicle-injected mice and #p ≤ 0.05 vs TWEAK-injected
  mice (n = 3 mice/group). (I) Tubular cell exposed to inflammatory stimuli (TWEAK,
  LPS) elicits antiviral responses that interact with proinflammatory pathways. TWEAK
  and LPS activate the canonical NF-κB pathway (red pathway) by activating the FN14
  and Myd88-adapted TLR4 receptors, respectively (highlighted in orange). Inhibiting
  TBK1/IKKε with amlexanox (AMX) decreases the activation of TWEAK- and LPS-elicited
  NF-κB (red) and TI-IFN (blue) pathways downstream of TBK1/IKKε (green pathway).
  In addition, inhibition of canonical IKKs by parthenolide (parth) or IKK16 or blockade
  of direct LPS-mediated TLR4 activation (Trif adapted branch) or TWEAK-mediated transactivation
  of TLR4 by CLI095 also limited TBK1/IKKε activation.'
