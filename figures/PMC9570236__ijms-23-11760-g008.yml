caption: Effect of NCS and PTX treatments in the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway in
  MDA-MB-231 cells. β-Catenin, total- and phosphorylated-GSK3-β protein levels expression
  levels after PTX and NCS treatment, both alone and in combination (1:2 ratio), were
  determined. (A–C) Representative β-Catenin and GSK3-β protein levels after drug
  treatments. The β-actin protein expression level was used as a loading control.
  (B–D) Graphs represent the quantification band intensity signal referred to β-actin
  expression, represented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Statistic
  t-test analysis of NCS and combined therapy was performed in comparison with control
  non-treated cells (black asterisks, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001)
  as well as with PTX treatment (blue asterisks, * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01).
