caption: 'The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
  and T-cells in tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells is upregulated
  by: (1) chromosome locus 9p24.1 alterations (polysomy, copy gain, amplification,
  translocation, etc.); (2) activation of JAK/STAT pathway due to chromosome locus
  9p24.1 alterations, kinases (such as ALK and non-ALK), JAK/STAT mutations; (3) EBV
  infection; (4) MEK/ERK pathway. PD-L1 on tumor cells and/or TAMs interact with PD-1
  on T-cells, leading to inhibition of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway and
  subsequent T-cell “exhaustion”. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can release T-cells
  from the inhibitory effects by tumor cells and/or TAMs and re-establish the T-cell-mediated
  antitumor immune response.'
