caption: 'Brain MRI, the specifications of the Kif4a mutation in patients’ family
  and the sequence alignment of KIF4. (A) Brain MRI in the IV-3 patient exhibited
  unremarkable MRI features. (B) Whole exome sequencing of the Kif4a gene in controls
  and patients was performed on DNA extracted from blood samples. Arrows (red) indicate
  the position of the mutation. Genotyping results for the parents III-1/2 and the
  children IV-1/2/3 were as follows: III-1, XWTXMut; III-2, XWTY; IV-1/2, XWTXMut;
  and IV-3, XMutY. (C) Multiple sequence alignment of the KIF4 coiled–coil region
  from the indicated species. R728 is highly conserved in KIF4 throughout evolution.'
