caption: The moderating effect of the interaction of cigarette smoking index and the
  susceptibility measures in the ROIs on clinical performance in PD patients, with
  covariates of TIV and age. The slopes changed with the moderator variable of smoking
  index in disordinal forms. (A-H) For heavy-burdened smokers (mean SI + SD, red line)
  the relationship between the susceptibility values of bilateral thalami and the
  UPDRS III score, rigidity and bradykinesia subscores were negative (the regression
  line slopes downwards), whereas for light-burdened smokers (mean SI − 1SD, blue
  line) the relationships were positive (the regression line slopes upwards). SI,
  smoking index; SD, standard deviation; QSM, quantitative susceptibility mapping;
  ROI, regions of interest; PD, Parkinson’s disease; TIV, total intracranial volume;
  UPDRS III, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III.
article_title: The protective role of cigarette smoking against Parkinson’s disease
  via moderation of the interaction between iron deposition in the nigrostriatal pathway
  and clinical symptoms.
