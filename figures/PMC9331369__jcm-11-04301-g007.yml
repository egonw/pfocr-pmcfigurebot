caption: 'Effect of Ulva pertusa on antioxidant system and SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway. The
  administration of Ulva pertusa at the dose of 50 mg/kg, but more powerfully at the
  dose of 100 mg/kg, was able to strengthen the antioxidant response upregulating
  GSH, CAT, and SOD levels (B–D) and decreasing MDA levels (A). Furthermore, Ulva
  pertusa administration increased the expression of the nuclear factor Nrf2 (E),
  densitometric analysis (E1), and upregulated the enzymes MnSOD (G), densitometric
  analysis (G1) and HO-1 (H), densitometric analysis (H1). In addition, treatment
  with Ulva, at both doses, significantly restored SIRT1 levels which had previously
  been reduced by DNBS-induced colitis (F), densitometric analysis (F1). Data are
  representative of at least three independent experiments. Values are means ± SD.
  One-way ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni. One-way ANOVA test. *** p < 0.001 vs.
  Sham; # p < 0.05 vs. DNBS; ## p < 0.01 vs. DNBS; ### p < 0.001 vs. DNBS.'
