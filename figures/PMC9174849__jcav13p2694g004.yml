caption: 'Effects of TMEM158 on tumorigenesis and progression. GSEA analysis showing
  the association between TMEM158 and EMT. (B)-(D) Effects of TMEM158 knockdown in
  BT549 and HCC1187 cells and overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells on cell morphology.
  (E)-(F) GSEA enrichment analysis, showing the association of TMEM158 with the TGF-β
  signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. NC: negative control siRNA; Si1: TMEM158
  siRNA1; Si2: TMEM158 siRNA2; OE: TMEM158 overexpression; SD: standard deviation.
  All data are shown as mean ± SD. All experiments were repeated at least three times.
