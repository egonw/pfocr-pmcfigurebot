caption: 'Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The pathway selection is based on pathways
  that are significant (p < 0.001) multiple times, as well as in the top 20 per exposure
  multiple times. Red: upregulated; blue, downregulated; no colour: not significantly
  altered. Size: number of genes on the microarray (for a specific pathway). The pathways
  were ordered (1) based on the response and (2) alphabetically within each type of
  response.'
