caption: Transcriptional heterogeneity controlled by TFs regulatory factors. A. Heatmap
  of the activity of the top five regulons inferred by SENIC analysis of malignant
  cells grouped by meta-programs. B. UMAP visualization of the activity of six regulatory
  factors (TRPS1, TWIST2, BRCA1, MYBL2, PPARG, EPAS1). C. Box plots of the correlations
  between MYBL2 expression and clinical prognosis (metastasis, stages, risk grades).
  P-values were calculated by the Wilcoxon test.
article_title: MYBL2 accelerates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and hepatoblastoma
  metastasis via the Smad/SNAI1 pathway.
