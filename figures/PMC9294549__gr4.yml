caption: Twist1 bound to EphA2 promoter and increased the expression of EphA2. (A)
  EphA2 expression increased in gene chip. Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
  with shTwist1 or negative controls. (B) Levels of Twist1 and EphA2 were detected
  by Western blot. (C) ChIP assay detected Twist1 binding to EphA2 promoter. (D) Dual
  luciferase reporter assay detected the binding of Twist1 to EphA2 promoter mutant
  and wild site. *P<0.05, **P<0.01.
