caption: 'OsRACK1B alters the Rboh and antioxidant activity. (A) Native PAGE (in-gel)
  analysis of Rboh activity. Rice leaves from OsRACK1B overexpressed and WT plants
  were fractionated by denaturing PAGE and assayed for Rboh activity. Fifty micromolar
  of Rboh inhibitor, DPI, was added to the microsomal fraction of leaf from wild-type
  rice plant before loading in the designated well of the native PAGE gel indicated
  in the Rboh activity gel. The straight and dotted lines in RBOH activity gel indicate
  the different migration patterns of the Rboh enzyme. (B) Western blot analysis of
  OsRBOHD protein showing higher accumulation of the protein compared to the WT. An
  equal amount of leaf proteins extracted from the indicated genotypes was subjected
  to immunoblot analysis stained with anti-OsRBOHD antibody. Ponceau-stained membrane
  is shown as the loading control. Molecular weight markers are indicated in kDa.
  (C) The activity of SOD isozymes; MnSOD and CuZnSOD from total proteins extracted
  from OX and WT plants. SODs were separated by native PAGE on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide
  gels, and gels were stained by the photochemical nitroblue tetrazolium method and
  scanned using flat-bed scanner. (D,E) qRT-PCR analysis shows elevated transcript
  levels of OsRbohD and OsCatB genes. The transcript levels were normalized using
  OsActin-1 (LOC4333919). The data are shown as the means  ±  SE of three technical
  repeats. Single, double, and triple asterisks indicate statistical significance:
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001, respectively, compared to wild-type
  (Student’s t-test). Primers are listed in .'
