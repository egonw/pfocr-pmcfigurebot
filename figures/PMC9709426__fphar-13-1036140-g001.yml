caption: Molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis in breast cancer. lipid peroxidation
  leads to ferroptosis. PUFA is catalyzed by LPCAT3, ACSL4 and LOX to generate PUFA-PLOOH,
  which induces ferroptosis. In addition, PUFAs also promote ferroptosis through POR-mediated
  conversion to lipid peroxides. The MVA pathway suppresses ROS by regulating Sec-tRNA
  and CoQ10. The iron mediates ferroptosis. FPN regulates the intracellular iron level
  by converting Fe2+ to extracellular iron. TF binds to the TFR to convert Fe3+ to
  Fe2+ and enter cells. Free Fe2+ then induces the lipid ROS production by Fenton
  reaction.
