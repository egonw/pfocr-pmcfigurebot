caption: 'W1131 triggers ferroptosis and inhibited GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1 expression
  in gastric cancer A: Bubble chart displaying the gene enrichment analyses, as detected
  by RNA-seq in AGS cells treated with W1131(1 μM) for 48 h, as compared to vehicle
  (DMSO). B: GSEA of the FNR signature and IL6 JAK STAT3 pathway in AGS cells treated
  with W1131(1 μM) for 48 h, as compared to vehicle (DMSO). C: Volcano plot showing
  genome‐wide mRNA expression in AGS cells treated with W1131(1 μM) for 48 h, as compared
  to vehicle (DMSO) (P < 0.01; log2 (Fold Change)|>0.585). D: RT-PCR analysis of the
  indicated genes in AGS and MGC803 cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) or W1131 for
  48 h. E: Immunoblotting analysis of the indicated proteins in AGS cells treated
  with vehicle (DMSO) or W1131 for 48 h. F: Electron micrographs in MGC803 cells treated
  with vehicle (DMSO) or W1131 for 24 h. G: AGS cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO)
  or W1131 (1 μM) in the absence or presence of Ferrostatin-1(2 μM), Liproxstatin-1(2 μM)
  and DFO(100 μM) for 24 h, and then intracellular MDA were assayed. H: AGS cells
  were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or W1131 (1 μM) in the absence or presence of Ferrostatin-1(2 μM),
  Liproxstatin-1(2 μM) and DFO(100 μM) for 24 h, and then GSH/GSSG ratio were assayed.
  I: C11-BODIPY 581/591 probe was used to detected lipid peroxidation level in AGS
  cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) or W1131 (1 μM) in the absence or presence of
  Ferrostatin-1(2 μM), Liproxstatin-1(2 μM) and DFO(100 μM) for 24 h by flow cytometry.
  Quantification of C11-BODIPY 581/591(FL1) fluorescence was shown. J: FerroOrange
  probe was used to detected intracellular Fe2+ level in AGS cells treated with vehicle
  (DMSO) or W1131 (1 μM) in the absence or presence of Ferrostatin-1(2 μM), Liproxstatin-1(2 μM),
  and DFO(100 μM) for 24 h by flow cytometry. Quantification of FerroOrange(PE) fluorescence
  was shown. K: Liperfluo and FeroOrange staining for intracellular lipid ROS and
  Fe2+ level in AGS cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) or the indicated concentrations
  of W1131 for 24 h. Shown is one of five representative fields illustrating fluorescence
  intensity taken at identical exposures for each condition. Scale bars = 50 μm. *P < 0.05,
  **P ≤ 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001. n = 3. Student''s t-test. All data were
  shown as means ± s.d.'
