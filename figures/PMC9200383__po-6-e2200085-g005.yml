caption: Characteristics of HA cases and GS cases. (A) Per-patient HRR alteration
  type analysis in HA and/or GS cases, following stratification by sex and TP53 mutation
  status. Numbers in parentheses next to cancer types represent the number of cases
  in the four groups, respectively. (B) Comparisons of three gene expressionâ€“based
  HRD assessment scores after stratification by HA and GS. These scores were calculated
  from modification of the RPS, comparison between TCGA ovarian cancer samples, and
  KEGG pathway database, respectively (Data Supplement). *, **, and *** stand for
  P < .05, P < .01, and P < .001 in the Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. GS, genomic
  scar high; HA, HRR-altered; HRD, homologous recombination deficiency; HRR, homologous
  recombination repair; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; OV-GS, TCGA
  ovarian cancer derived genomic scar score; RPS, recombination proficiency score;
  rRPS, reversed recombination proficiency score; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.
