caption: Interfering with ANTXR1 inhibits erythroid cell proliferation and promotes
  erythroid cell differentiation and apoptosis in K562 cells. (a) Western blot analysis
  was used to detect ANTXR1 levels after transfection of K562 cells with ANTXR1 interfering
  vectors. (b) Quantification of western blots. (c) CCK8 assay of K562 cells proliferation
  at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. (d) Flow cytometry detection of CD71 and CD235a expression
  in K562 cells erythroid differentiation. (e) Benzidine staining-positive cells.
  (f) Changes in the proportion of benzidine-positive cells. (g, h) Quantitative reverse
  transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the mRNA
  expression levels of GATA1 and ALAS2 in K562 erythrocytes induced by interfering
  with ANTXR1. (i) GATA1 and ALAS2 protein expression in K562 erythrocytes induced
  by interfering with ANTXR1. (j, k) Quantification of western blots. Error bars represent
  standard deviation of three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
