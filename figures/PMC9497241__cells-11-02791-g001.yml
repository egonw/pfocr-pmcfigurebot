caption: General miRNA biogenesis pathway and the related functions in cells; miRNA
  biogenesis begins with transcription by RNA polymerase II/III to create a pri-miRNA
  and is cleaved by Drosha/DGCR8 (cropping). The pre-miRNA is then exported to the
  cytoplasm via Exportin-5/Ran GTPase for further processing by Dicer/TRBP (dicing).
  Of this processed miRNA/miRNA* duplex, a “guide strand” is selected and loaded onto
  the Ago2 protein while the remaining passenger strand (miRNA*) is degraded. With
  the formation of a miRISC complex, target mRNA can be regulated and subsequently
  affect cellular and tumorigenic properties. pri-miRNA—primary microRNA, DGCR8—DiGeorge
  syndrome critical region 8, pre-miRNA—precursor microRNA, TRBP—transactivation response
  element RNA-binding protein, Ago2—argonaute protein 2, and miRISC—microRNA-induced
  silencing complex.
