caption: Transcriptomic pro-inflammatory signature is a prognostic marker for OsA’s
  metastatic spreading. (A) Characteristics of OsA cohorts; (B) MCPs score according
  to patients 5-years metastatic status. A higher score of genes linked to cytotoxic
  T-cells, monocyte lineage and NK cells was found in the 5-years metastatic-free
  group; (C) Expression of proinflammatory cytokines according to 5-years metastatic
  status. The expression of IL1β, IL6 and IFNγ was higher in the 5-years metastasis-free
  group; (D) Expression of antigen presentation related genes and TLR genes according
  to 5 years metastatic status. Higher score of activation of antigen presenting pathway,
  TLR pathway were found in the 5-year metastasis-free group; (E) Prognostic value
  of TLR4 expression for OsA’s metastatic spreading. A higher expression of TLR4 was
  associated with a significantly better metastasis free survival (p = 0.0035). *
  p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001.
