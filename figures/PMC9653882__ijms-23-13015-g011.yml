caption: 'Puerarin-V hindered NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD mediated pyroptosis signaling
  pathway activation. (A–H) Western blot analyses were performed for NLRP3, P2X7,
  N-GSDMD, Cleaved-caspase-1, ASC, IL-1β, and IL-18 expression, and normalization
  was performed using β-actin expression. The data are represented by mean ± SEM (n
  = 6). #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 vs. control group. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs.
  model group.'
