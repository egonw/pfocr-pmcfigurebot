caption: Knockdown of TFAM reversed the protective effect of either CA-074Me or quinpirole
  in vitro. PACs were isolated and infected with adenovirus for 6 h. After 18 h, PACs
  were pretreated with CA-074Me (10 μM) or quinpirole (5 μM) for 0.5 h and then stimulated
  with 200 nM CCK. (a, b) Immunoblot analysis and quantification of TFAM proteins
  in PACs after Adv-shTFAM infection compared to Adv-Con infection group. Cell injury
  determined by (c) the percentage of ATP depletion and (d) LDH leakage (n=4 per group).
  (e, f) Representative images and quantification of DHE-stained PACs showing the
  levels of superoxide anions (n=3 per group, scale bar 100 μm). (g, h) Immunoblot
  analysis and quantification of RIP3, p-MLKL, and MLKL proteins of PACs (n=4 per
  group). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
