caption: 'Effects of circ_SFMBT2 and YTHDF2 on NSCLC progression (a–d). The cell proliferation
  (a), viability (b), and migratory ability (c, d) were determined using CCK-8 assay,
  colony-forming assay, and transwell assay, respectively. Western blot analysis of
  the expression levels of MMP-9, E-cadherin, and vimentin (e) or Hippo/YAP pathway
  components (f) in the cells. ∗∗p < 0.01 versus the siNC group, and ##p < 0.01 versus
  the si-YTHDF2 group.'
