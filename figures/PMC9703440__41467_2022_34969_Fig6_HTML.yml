figure_title: TCF4 and IRF4 function downstream of p38α to regulate Blimp1 transcription
caption: a Flow cytometry analysis of iPCs differentiated from cultured Cas9tg/+ B
  cells transduced with retroviruses encoding p38α or Tcf4 sgRNA (CD19+GFP+BFP+CD138+).
  Immunoblot analysis of BLIMP1, TCF4, and Actin expression in Tcf4 sgRNA expressing
  B cells at indicated time points after being transferred onto IL-21 feeder cells.
  b Schematic diagram of a putative TCF4-binding site in the Prdm1 locus. CUT&Tag
  analysis of TCF4 binding genomic fragments including the reported TCF4 binding site
  in Blimp1 enhancer region in cultured p38α KO and WT B cells at day 2 after transferred
  onto IL-21 feeder cells (n = 3 per group). c Flow cytometry analysis of iPCs among
  cultured p38α KO B cells transduced with retroviruses encoding TCF4 (CD19+GFP+CD138+)
  (n = 6 per group), protein levels of TCF4, IgG H-chain, BLIMP1, p38α and Actin were
  analyzed by immunoblot. d–f Same as described in (a–c) except that Irf4 sgRNAs were
  used or IRF4 was overexpressed in cultured p38α KO B cells. g Cultured p38αfl/flVavcreCas9tg/+
  and p38αfl/flCas9tg/+ B cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding sgRNA targeting
  p38α, Tcf3, Tcf4 and Irf4 at day 2 of culture (n = 3 per group). Percentages of
  iPCs in sgRNA transduced B cells (CD19+GFP+BFP+CD138+) were analyzed by flow cytometry
  at day 8. NTC, non-targeting control. Data were representative of at least three
  independent experiments. Each symbol represents a representative sample. Small horizontal
  lines indicate the mean (±s.d.). Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-tests.
