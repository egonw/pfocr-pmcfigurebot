caption: Circ_0055412 recruits EIF4A3 protein to enhance the stability of CAPG mRNA.
  (A) The overlapping results predicted from circinteractome and starBase databases
  were exhibited by Venn diagram. (B) RNA pull down assay was carried out to explore
  the combination of circ_0055412 with EIF4A3. (C) RIP assay was performed to assess
  the interaction between EIF4A3 and circ_0055412 or CAPG. (D) FISH and IF analyses
  were implemented to detect the localization of circ_0055412 and EIF4A3 in glioma
  cells. (E, F) The mRNA and protein levels of EIF4A3 were detected with the use of
  RT‐qPCR and western blot assays in U251 and LN229 cells upon EIF4A3 deficiency.
  (G, H) CAPG expression was tested via RT‐qPCR and western blot assays after EIF4A3
  was depleted in glioma cells. (I) CAPG mRNA stability was examined through RT‐qPCR
  when EIF4A3 or circ_0055412 was downregulated in glioma cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01

  cells through modulation of CAPG and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.
