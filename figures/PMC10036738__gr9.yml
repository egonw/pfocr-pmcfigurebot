caption: GRHL3 and HOPX expression is reduced in patient-derived esophageal SCC samples
  leading to activation of Wnt signaling pathway. (A) GRHL3 mRNA expression in 51
  oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) samples compared with its own paired normal
  tissue, calculated from GSE23400. Statistics were calculated using unpaired, two-tailed
  Student t test, and P values are indicated on the graph. (B) HOPX mRNA expression
  in 51 OSCC samples compared with its own paired normal tissue, calculated from GSE23400.
  Statistics were calculated using unpaired, two-tailed Student t test, and P values
  are indicated on the graph. (C) Correlation between GRHL3 and HOPX mRNA expression
  in patient samples calculated from GSE23400. Pearson r method using GraphPad prism
  is used to calculate the correlation between the mRNA expression. (D) WNT2, WNT9A,
  and MET mRNA expression in 51 OSCC samples compared with its own paired normal tissue,
  calculated from GSE23400. Statistics were calculated using unpaired, two-tailed
  Student t test, and P values are indicated on the graph. (E) Representative immunohistochemical
  images of 3 human patient esophageal samples immunohistochemically stained with
  CTNNB. Scale bar = 50 μm. (F) Representative immunohistochemical images of human
  patient esophageal samples immunohistochemically stained with GRHL3, HOPX, and WNT9A.
  Scale bar = 50 μm.
