caption: Evaluation of the Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C and AIF protein levels. Western blot
  analysis was performed in order to determine the Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C and AIF protein
  levels in NB4 cells after treatment with different concentrations of realgar (0,
  12.5, 25.0, 50.0 and 75.0 Î¼g/ml, respectively) for 24, 48 and 72 h, and three independent
  experiments were repeated. (A) Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C and AIF protein levels; (B) Histogram
  analysis of the target protein expression levels in NB4 cells. *P < 0.05, **P <
  0.01, and ***P < 0.001 vs. relevant control samples.
