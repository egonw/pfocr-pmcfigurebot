caption: 'Effects of AMK extract on MAPK pathway in AGS cells. (A) Western blot was
  employed to assess the phosphorylation levels of key proteins in the MAPK pathway,
  including ERK, JNK, p38, and AKT. (B) The quantification of phosphorylated (1) ERK,
  (2) JNK, (3) p38, and (4) AKT was based on band densities relative to the density
  of GAPDH. Results are presented as the means Â± standard error. ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001 compared to untreated controls. AMK: Atractylodes
  macrocephala Koidz.'
