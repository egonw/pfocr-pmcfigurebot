caption: Gain/loss of function associated with modulated activity of PPP enzymesSensitivity  of
  output Y with respect to modulation of X () as a function of H and the extent of
  parameter modulation.(A–F) The output variable Y is either H2O2 (A, C, and E) or
  NADPH-producing flux (B, D, and F) and the modulated parameter is either  (A and
  B),  (C and D) or  (E and F).
