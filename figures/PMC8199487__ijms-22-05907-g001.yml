caption: 'Pathway analysis for genes potentially associated with HDAC8 by bioinformatics
  tools. shRNA HDAC8 was entered into the CLUE database, and CP and PCL with a score
  of >90 were selected (A). The target genes were entered into the CPDB pathway analysis
  database (B) for further experiments. (C) Top 10 pathways for selecting CP and PCL
  (score > 90) for shRNA HDAC8. Ten pathways as below: VEGF; PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway;
  JAK STAT pathway and regulation; Signaling Pathway; MAPK signaling pathway—Homo
  sapiens (human); Apoptosis; Autophagy; HIF-1 signaling pathway; TNF-related weak
  inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) Signaling Pathway; Wnt Signaling Pathway. VEGF; PI3K-Akt
