caption: 'Effects of low glucose plus BHB on the GPR109A/p38/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A–C), the relative mRNA expression levels of GPR109A, p38, and PPARγ (n = 6); (D–H),
  the gel picture and grayscale analysis of the immunoblot assay of GPR109A, p65,
  PPARγ, p-p38, and p38 (n = 3). Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
  One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences among groups. In (A–C): * 0.01
  < p < 0.05 for AMs treated with normal glucose; ** 0.001 < p < 0.01 for AMs treated
  with normal glucose; ## 0.001 < p < 0.01 for AMs treated with low glucose. In (E–H):
  * 0.01 < p < 0.05; ** 0.001 < p < 0.01. NG, normal glucose; LG, low glucose.'
