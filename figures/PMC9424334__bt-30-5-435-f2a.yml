caption: CKD-581 down-regulates Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (A) Heatmap analysis of gene
  expression profiles in hematologic cancer cells. HH and MJ cells were treated with
  100 nM CKD-581, and Total RNA samples were purified. Expression level of mRNA was
  analyzed with the Infinium® HumanHT-12 BeadChip. (B) Effects of HDAC inhibitors
  on DACT family expression. MM.1S and RPMI8226 cells were treated with the indicated
  concentrations of CKD-581 or SAHA for 24 h, and total cell lysates were subjected
  to immunoblottings. (C) DACT3 expression induced by CKD-581. MM.1S and RPMI8226
  cells were treated with 300 nM CKD-581 in a time-dependent manner. (D) MM.1S and
  RPMI8226 cells were treated with various concentrations of CKD-581 or SAHA for 24
  h. And total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblottings for β-catenin and c-Myc.
  Data represent mean ± SEM (significant vs. control; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).
  C, control; S, 1000 nM SAHA.
