figure_title: A CRISPR-Cas9 screen identifies TFPI as a receptor for TcdB4
caption: a Schematic diagram of the CRISPR-Cas9 screen process. b Genes identified
  by NGS were analyzed with the MAGeCK program and plotted based on the log2 value
  of fold change of NGS reads and statistical significance (shown as log10 value of
  RRA p-value and plotted as the y-axis). The genes involved in the GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)
  biosynthetic pathway are colored red. c Schematic diagram of human TFPIβ (TFPI),
  a GPI-anchored protein with two BPTI/Kunitz protease inhibitor domains (K1 and K2).
  N, N-termini; C, C-termini. HeLa (d) or A549 (e) KO cells lacking TFPI, TFPI2 (a
  homolog of TFPI), PIGS, or PIGV were generated via the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. UGP2-KO
  cells were also analyzed as a control. Cells were exposed to recombinant TcdB4.2
  for 24 h. Their CR50 values are normalized to WT and plotted in a bar-chart (f).
  Error bars indicate mean ± s.d.; N = 3 (biologically independent experiments); *,
  p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test, two-sided). g–i HeLa (g) or 5637 (h) cells
  overexpressing triple-HA-tagged TFPI, TFPI2, or mouse TFPI (mTFPI) via lentiviral
  transduction were exposed to TcdB4.2 for 24 h. The percentages of rounded cells
  were plotted over toxin concentrations. Their CR50 values are normalized to WT and
  plotted in a bar-chart (i). Error bars indicate mean ± s.d.; N = 3 (biologically
  independent experiments); **, p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test, two-sided). j Binding
  of TcdB4.2 (500 nM) to Fc-tagged TFPI, TFPI2, and mTFPI (immobilized onto capture
  biosensors) was examined using biolayer interferometry (BLI) assays. Fc-tagged extracellular
  domains of FZD2 (CRD2), SEMA6A, and IgG were used as controls. Representative sensorgrams
  from one of three independent experiments are shown. k HeLa cells were exposed to
  either TcdB4.2 alone (4 pM) or TcdB4.2 pre-incubated with Fc-tagged TFPI, TFPI2,
  or mTFPI at the indicated molar ratios (1:250 ~ 1:20,000) on ice for 1 h. The percentage
  of cell-rounding at 6 h incubation was plotted. Error bars indicate mean ± s.d.;
  N = 3 (biologically independent experiments); *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (Student’s
  t-test, two-sided). l HeLa-WT, TFPI-KO, and TFPI2-KO cells were exposed to recombinant
  TcdB2.1, TcdB7.2, TcdB12.1, TcsL, or culture supernatants of C. difficile strains
  expressing TcdB10.1 or TcdB11.2 for 24 h. The percentages of rounded cells were
  plotted over toxin concentrations are shown in Supplementary Fig. . Their CR50 values
  were normalized to WT and plotted here. Error bars indicate mean ± s.d.; N = 3 (biologically
  independent experiments). m–p HeLa-WT, two CSPG4 KO single clones (CSPG4#1 and CSPG4#8),
  and two CSPG4/TFPI double KO cells (CSPG4#1-TFPI-KO and CSPG4#8-TFPI-KO) were exposed
  to TcdB4.2 (m), TcdB2.1 (n), or TcdB2.2 (o) for 24 h. The percentages of rounded
  cells were plotted over toxin concentrations. Their relative CR50 values are plotted
  in a bar-chart (p). Error bars indicate mean ± s.d.; N = 3 (biologically independent
  experiments); **, p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test, two-sided). q HeLa cells overexpressing
  HA-tagged TFPI, TFPI2, or mTFPI via lentiviral transduction were exposed to recombinant
  TcdB2.1, TcdB2.2, TcdB7.2, TcdB12.1, TcsL, or culture supernatants of C. difficile
  strains expressingTcdB10.1 or TcdB11.2 for 24 h. The percentages of rounded cells
  were plotted over toxin concentrations and are shown in Supplementary Fig. . Their
  CR50 values are normalized to WT and plotted here. Error bars indicate mean ± s.d.;
  N = 3 (biologically independent experiments); **, p < 0.01 (Student’s t-test, two-sided).
