caption: Annotation results and expression profiles of differentially expressed (DEPs)
  proteins. (A) Venn diagram of GO, KEGG, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Interpro
  (IPR) database annotation results. (B) Volcano maps representing expression pattern
  of DEGs. Red spots represent upregulated DEGs. Green spots indicate downregulated
  DEGs. Those shown in black are proteins that did not show obvious changes in A phase
  and B phase of F hirta bracts. CuA VS CuB represent multiples of protein expression
  in both A phase and B phase of F hirta bracts.
