caption: The regulatory role of an exogenous supply of GA and its biosynthetic pathway
  in mitigating salt stress. The GA 20-oxidase catalyzes GA12, GA15, GA24, and GA9.
  Similarly, GA9 is further converted to GA4 by GA-3 oxidase. The GA signaling activation
  pathway occurs due to the interaction between DeLLA proteins and GID1, which leads
  to the degradation of DELLA proteins. The degradation of DELLA proteins reduces
  the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improves plant growth under
  salt stress. The over-expression of GID1 increases plant sensitivity. GID1 with
  GAS carries the GA signal to the DELLA proteins to modulate the expression of GAs
  synthesis genes, XERICO. XERICO genes reduce salt stress and improve crop growth
  and yield. GA exogenous application enhances the contents of indole-3-acetic acid
  (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) and, as a result, improves fiber strength, micornaire
  reading, reproductive organ development, and maturation in plant color.
