figure_title: Delayed normalization model qualitatively captures key orientation masking
  response features
caption: (A) Schematic of the normalization model showing the visual input being processed
  by separate excitatory and normalization signal pathways. The normalization pathway
  in particular was modeled with a slightly delayed temporal kinetics and wider orientation
  tuning curves. The excitatory signal undergoes divisive normalization prior to neural
  output. (B–D) Modeled columnar response output with target contrast of 24% and background
  contrast of 12%. Modeled response normalized to the target only response averaged
  over 50–200ms as plotted in (E). (B) Modeled response of oriented backgrounds as
  in . (C) Modeled response of background with additive target as in , and the modeled
  response of the small Gabor target in black. (D) The target evoked response was
  obtained by subtracting the background only response (B) from (C), matching the
  biphasic observation in . (E) Model response integrated over 50–200ms in the same
  format as . (F) Correlation of modeled behavioral performance (Gaussian fit in )
  against each time frame of the modeled response, illustrating the early phase where
  the response was negatively correlated to behavioral choice, and the late phase
  with positive correlations. (G–J) Modeled time course of the population tuning vector.
  (G) Modeled populating tuning trajectory of the background only stimuli (color coded)
  as in . (H) Modeled populating tuning trajectory of the background with additive
  target illustrating the turn towards a convergent point on the x-axis as in . (I)
  Modeled target evoked response trajectory from subtracting (F) from (G). (J) Modeled
  populating tuning trajectory of the target only trials as in .
