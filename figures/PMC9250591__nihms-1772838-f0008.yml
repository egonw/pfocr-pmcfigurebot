figure_title: Ectopic expression of Hhip in fungiform papilla after chorda tympani/lingual
  nerve cut
caption: '(A-F) Immunostaining of the chorda tympani, CT (P2X3, green) and lingual,
  LN nerves (NF, green), and taste bud cells (K8, red) in Control (no nerve cut) side
  of tongue and in contralateral tongue after 21 days of CT/LN nerve cut. Three types
  of fungiform papilla (FP)/taste bud (TB) are assessed: I. Typical FP/TB, II. Atypical
  FP/TB and III. Atypical FP/No TB. In Control, in Typical FP/TB, the CT nerve innervates
  TB (A) while the LN nerve is widely distributed to FP epithelial cells (D). After
  nerve cut, in Atypical FP with or without the TB, the CT nerve is eliminated (B,C)
  and LN nerve fibers are much reduced (E,F). (D’-F’) X-Gal staining in HhiplacZ/+
  reporter demonstrates expression in FILIF (Control) in Typical FP/TB and an ectopic
  expression at/near the FP apical region after the CT/LN nerve cut in Atypical FP/TB
  and Atypical FP/No TB (arrows). (G-I) HHIP immunostaining (red) resembles Hhip expression
  in Control tongue and in contralateral tongue after CT/LN nerve cut (arrows). K8
  labels TB cells (green). Yellow dotted lines label the surface of epithelium in
  A-I. White dotted lines outline the base of the epithelium in A-I. Scale bar in
  A applies to the images in B and C. (J) Percentage of Typical FP/TB, Atypical FP/TB
  and Atypical FP/No TB in Control and CT/LN nerve cut. (K) Percentage of total FP
  with ectopic Hhip expression in HhiplacZ reporter, in Control and after CT/LN nerve
  cut. (L) Percentage of total FP with ectopic HHIP expression in Control and after
  CT/LN nerve cut. Statistical analysis is independent sample t-test (*p<0.001; **p<0.01).
