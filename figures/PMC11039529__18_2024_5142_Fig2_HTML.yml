caption: 'Genetic interaction of zip with Notch pathway components. Representative
  wings from different Notch pathway component mutants are shown in first column and
  in trans-heterozygous condition with zip mutants zip1 and zip2, are shown in second
  and third column respectively. Wing from wild type is shown in A and from zip alleles
  are shown in A′–A″. B-C″ Wings from heterozygote N54l9 (B) and hemizygous Nnd−3
  (C) shows nicking phenotype which were further increased in number in trans-heterozygous
  combination with loss-of-function alleles of zip, zip1 (B′, C′), and zip2 (B″, C″).
  D–E″ Heterozygous wings of DL5f (D) and hemizygous dx (E) showed vein thickening
  phenotype which was enhanced in trans-heterozygous condition with zip mutants (D′,
  D″ and E′, E″) respectively. (F–F″) Representative wings of loss-of-function allele
  of Mastermind driven by C96-GAL4 showed serrated wing margin phenotype, which was
  further enhanced by combining zip alleles trans-heterozygously. (B‴, C‴ and F‴)
  Graphs representing the percentage of wings showing nicking phenotype (B‴ and C‴)
  and approximate number of bristles on the posterior margin of the wing (F‴) in trans-heterozygous
  combination of zip mutants with the components of Notch signaling. (B‴ and C‴) All
  experiments were performed in triplicates (n). For consistency a total of 80 flies/vial
  was observed (B‴) No. of wings with nicking phenotype N54l9/ + : n1 = 22/80, n2 = 20/80
  and n3 = 24/80; N54l9/zip1: n1 = 48/80, n2 = 42/80 and n 3 = 52/80; N54l9/zip2:
  42/80, n2 = 40/80 and n3 = 46/80. (C‴) No. of wings with nicking phenotype Nnd3:
  n1 = 22/80, n2 = 22/80 and n3 = 24/80; Nnd3/zip1: n1 = 30/80, n2 = 27/80 and n3 = 32/80;
  Nnd3/zip2: 28/80, n2 = 20/80 and n3 = 36/80. F‴ The genotype of the flies mentioned
  on the X-axis of the graph are as follows: C96-GAL4/UAS-Mam H, C96-GAL4/UAS-Mam
  H + zip1, C96-GAL4/UAS-Mam H + zip2. Unpaired t-test was performed to determine
  p-value (**p < 0.01, ***p > 0.001). Scale bar: 3 cm'
