caption: Transcriptome sequencing of leaves of Chrysanthemum morifolium following
  infection with the Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum virus B (CVB-CN). a The length
  distribution of all assembled unigenes. b The GC content frequency distribution
  of all assembled unigenes. c The number of unigenes annotated by different databases,
  including NR, eggNOG, GO, KEGG, Pfam, and Swiss-Prot. d E-value distribution of
  all NR-annotated unigenes. e Species distribution of all NR-annotated unigenes.
  f Category classification of all eggNOG-annotated unigenes
article_title: Integrated next-generation sequencing and comparative transcriptomic
  analysis of leaves provides novel insights into the ethylene pathway of Chrysanthemum
  morifolium in response to a Chinese isolate of chrysanthemum virus B.
