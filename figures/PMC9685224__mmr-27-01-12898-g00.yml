caption: 'Effect of UA and DOX on the proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis
  of HCT116 and HT-29 CRC cells. (A) Human CRC cells in logarithmic growth phase were
  treated with UA (15 µM) and DOX (1.5 µM) for 48 h. Inhibitory effects on cell proliferation
  were assessed using cell proliferation assay. (B) Colony formation assay. UA + DOX
  significantly inhibited colony formation in colon cancer cells compared with the
  control after 2 weeks. (C) Proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase increased following
  treatment with UA + DOX. (D) HCT116 and HT-29 cells were collected to assess apoptotic
  rate using FITC/PI double-positive staining following UA + DOX treatment. (E) Following
  CRC cell treatment with UA (15 µM) or DOX (1.5 µM) for 48 h, apoptosis-associated
  c-PARP, PARP, c-Caspase-9 and Caspase-9 expression was semi-quantified using western
  blotting. Values were normalized to GAPDH. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. control; #P<0.05,
  ##P<0.01. vs. UA/DOX. Scale bar, 500 µm. CONT, control; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide;
  UA, ursolic acid; DOX, doxorubicin; CRC, colorectal cancer; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose)
  polymerase 1; PI, propidium iodide; ns, not significant; c-, cleaved.'
article_title: Inhibition of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis by ursolic acid and doxorubicin
  is mediated by targeting the Akt signaling pathway and activating the Hippo signaling
  pathway.
