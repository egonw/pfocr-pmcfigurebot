caption: 'The mechanisms of oxidative stress-related intervertebral disc degeneration.
  Excessive ROS are produced in a state of oxidative stress; these ROS can further
  induce intervertebral disc degeneration through various mechanisms. ROS can cause
  the ossification of cartilage endplate and hinder the transportation of nutrition
  and metabolite in NP. ROS can also cause ECM degradation by converting anabolism
  to catabolism. ROS-induced inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy can disturb the
  cell function and reduce the cell number in NP via multiple pathways. Moreover,
  DNA damage caused by ROS can activate p53 and p16, then lead to cell senescence.
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; ECM: extracellular matrix; NP: nucleus pulposus; MMP:
  matrix metalloproteinase; ADAMTS: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin
  motifs; Coll II: type II collagen.'
