caption: 'EDV-COVID-αGC Clinical trial: Data from the 6 volunteers. (Ai) SVNT analysis
  of volunteer serum on day 1, 21, 28 post-initial injection and a booster on day
  21 against wild type, Delta and Omicron B.1.1.529 variants of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
  (Aii) SVNT analysis of volunteer serum against Omicron B.1.1.529 and Omicron BA.
  2 and BA. 4/5 variants of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, at 3 months post 2 doses of EDV-COVID-αGC
  only, 2 doses of BNT262b2 only, and EDV-COVID-αGC as a booster. Dotted line represents
  sVNT 30% cut-off correlating to a positive PRNT90 for 1:10 dilution of sera. (B,
  C) Serum IFNγ and IFNα levels respectively on day 1, 21 and 28 after initial injection
  and a day 21 booster. (C) Serum IFNα levels (pg/ml) on day 1, 21 and 28 post-initial
  injection. (D) CD4+ central memory T cells (TCM) (CD45RA- CD27+ CCR7+ CD3+ CD4+)
  analysis on day 1 and day 28. (E) CD8+ central memory T cells (CD45RA- CD27+ CCR7+
  CD3+ CD8+) analysis on day 1 and day 28. (F) Ex vivo PBMC production of IFNγ following
  SARS-CoV-2 S-protein stimulation on day 1 and day 28. (G) CD69 expression in T cells
  (CD45+ CD3+ CD69+) in ex vivo PBMCs following SARS-CoV-2 S-protein stimulation on
  day 1 and day 28. (H) Amount of S-protein specific CD19+ B cells in PBMCs on day
  1, 28, 2 months and 3 months following initial injection. (I) Amount of S-protein
  specific CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells in PBMCs on day 1, 28, 2 months and 3 months
  following initial injection. (J) Amount of IgM+ CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells in PBMCs
  on day 1, 28, 2 months and 3 months following initial injection. (K) Amount of IgG+
  CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells in PBMCs on day 1, 28, 2 months and 3 months following
  initial injection. Data presented as mean ± SEM, ns, not significant. Asterisks
  represent significant values (***p ≤ 0.001; **p ≤ 0.01; *p ≤ 0.05) between stated
  groups and calculated using paired t test on GraphPad Prism v 9.4.0.'
