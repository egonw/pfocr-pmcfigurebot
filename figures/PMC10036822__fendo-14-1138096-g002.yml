caption: MKRN2 expression levels are highly correlated with the receptor tyrosine
  kinase signaling pathway. (A) Heatmap plot of all differentially expressed proteins
  in Mkrn2-WT MEFs and Mkrn2-KO MEFs. The proteins and samples are respectively clustered
  by Euclidean distance, and the color block shows the classification. Upregulated
  proteins are coded in red color and downregulated proteins are coded in blue. (B)
  Volcano plot of DEGs in normospermic group and teratozoospermic group from GEO dataset
  GSE6872. According to the values of logFC and p-value (logFC ≥ 1 or ≤ −1, p < 0.05),
  all genes were classified into upregulated genes (red), downregulated genes (blue),
  and no changed genes (black). (C) The overlapping between differentially expressed
  proteins from proteomics (Proteomics_Diffpro) and DEGs from GSE6872 (GSE6872_Diffgene).
  (D) The signaling pathways are represented among overlapping genes and ranked according
  to the number of enriched genes. The color of the dots represents the p-value; the
  size of the dot represents the gene count, and the shape of the dots represents
  the gene ratio. The primary signaling pathway is signaling by receptor tyrosine
  kinases, including 18 genes, ranked by log2FC. (E) The overlapping of the results
  of the transcription factors array (TF_array) and genes of the signaling by receptor
  tyrosine kinase pathway. (F) Expression levels of the STAT family members in Mkrn2-WT
  MEFs and Mkrn2-KO MEFs, according to TF array results.
