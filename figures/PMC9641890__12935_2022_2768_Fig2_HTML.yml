caption: Hub genes in green and blue modules. A Go enrichment of green module. Top
  5 significant pathways in different aspects. Circle represents biological process,
  triangle represents cellular component, rectangle represents molecular function.
  B Go enrichment of blue module. Top 5 significant pathways in different aspects.
  Circle represents biological process, triangle represents cellular component, rectangle
  represents molecular function. C, D KEGG enrichment of green and blue modules respectively.
  E, F Hub genes in green and blue modules respectively, which is calculated by the
  MCODE in Cytoscape. G Differential expressed genes in GSE10448. Up genes represent
  genes highly expressed in pancreatic cancer patients with lymph node metastasis.
  Down genes represent genes highly expressed in pancreatic cancer patients without
  lymph node metastasis. H 0 gene was derived from the intersection between hub genes
  in green module and up genes in GSE10448. I 13 genes were derived from the intersection
  between hub genes in blue module and down genes in GSE10448
