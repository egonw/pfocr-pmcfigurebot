caption: Nuci increased energy metabolism in HFD-fed mice. Seven-weeks male C57BL/6J
  mice were fed with ND, HFD, HFD supplemented with Nuci and HFD with subcutaneous
  injection of Lira at 200 μg/kg/day for 12 weeks. General pictures of mice in ND,
  HFD, HFD-Nuci, and HFD-Lira group were presented (a). After 11 weeks of treatment,
  mice in the ND, HFD, and HFD-Nuci group were placed in metabolic cages at 22 °C
  at 12 h light–dark cycle. VO2 (b), VCO2 (d) were detected and quantification of
  VO2 (c), VCO2 (e), RER (f), EE (g), and locomotor activity (h) during both the light
  and dark cycle were determined by Promethion. Data were presented as mean ± SE,
  n = 4 in each group. * p < 0.05 vs. the HFD group.
