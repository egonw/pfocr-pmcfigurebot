caption: R-Y FMT and butyrate inhibit NLRP3-associated pro-inflammatory mediator expression.
  (A) Representative immunohistochemical staining of NLRP3, and immunofluorescence
  staining of caspase-1 and IL-1β in colon specimens. (B) Quantification of NLRP3
  expression using integrated optical density/specimen area (IOD/area); n = 6. (C
  and D) Quantification of caspase-1 and IL-1β in colon specimens using mean density
  (integrated density/specimen area); n = 6. (E) The expression levels of NLRP3, cleaved
  caspase-1 (P20), and mature IL-1β (P17) were detected in the colon tissues of R-Y
  FMT mice and the butyrate-treated mice colitis model. (F) The bands were quantified
  (n = 3). Scale bars = 100 μm. Error bars represent the mean ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01,
  ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
