caption: 'The effect of BHB on the pro-inflammatory response of AMs in normal- and
  low-glucose conditions. (A), the relative mRNA expression level of the p65 gene
  normalized to β-actin (n = 6); (B–D), the supernatant concentrations of interleukin-1β,
  interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in AMs exposed to normal/low glucose
  plus varying concentrations of BHB (n = 5). Data were expressed as the mean ± standard
  deviation. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences among groups. * 0.01
  < p < 0.05 for AMs treated with normal glucose; ** 0.001 < p < 0.01 for AMs treated
  with normal glucose; ## 0.001 < p < 0.01 for AMs treated with low glucose.'
