figure_title: Sestrin2 ameliorates HG-induced oxidative stress and activation of TSP-1/TGF-β1/Smad3
  signaling pathway in podocytes
caption: 'A–C The protein and mRNA level of Nox4 was detected by western blot and
  RT-qPCR in podocytes (n = 5). D–H The protein levels of TSP-1, TGF-β1, CD36, and
  phosphorylation level of Smad3 were examined by western blot in podocytes (n = 5).
  I–L RT-qPCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of TSP-1, TGF-β1, CD36, and Smad3
  in podocytes (n = 5). M ROS production of podocytes cultured under different conditions
  was determined by flow cytometry. NG: 5.6 mM d-glucose; M: 5.6 mM d-glucose+24.4 mM
  mannitol; HG: 30 mM d-glucose; HG + C: HG + control shRNA plasmid; HG + OE: HG + Sestrin2
  pcDNA; HG + shRNA: HG + Sestrin2 shRNA plasmid. Data are expressed as mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
