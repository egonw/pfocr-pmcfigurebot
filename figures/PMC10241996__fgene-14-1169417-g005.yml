caption: KEGG pathway enrichment of (A) loss DAR promoter genes and (B) gain DAR promoter
  genes. The horizontal axis is the gene ratio, which is the ratio of the gene number
  in the pathway to the pathways in the gene of the species. The vertical axis is
  the pathway. The color in the figure represents the size of the p-value, and the
  circle indicates the number of genes in the pathway.
