caption: 'Fasudil relieved HA spasm in vivo. Fasudil or physiological saline was injected
  into the left medial lobe of the liver using a 16G lumbar puncture needle through
  the laparotomic route. (A) The celiac artery angiogram revealed that the animal
  models of HA spasm were successfully established. (B) The aortography demonstrated
  that there was a small spastic segment of the artery in Fasudil group. The quantitative
  analysis showed that Fasudil infusion reduced the duration from inducing to relieving
  spasm. P<0.05: Fasudil group vs. Model group.'
