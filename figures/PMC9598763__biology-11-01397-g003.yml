caption: 'RNA sequencing analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched
  in two pathways. (A) KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs in WDR73 KO transcriptome. The
  top 20 most significantly enriched KEGG pathways are shown. (B) Gene Ontology (GO)
  functional clustering of DEGs. The top 10 most significantly affected categories
  are shown. BP, biological process; CC, cellular component). (C) The expression heatmap
  of focal adhesion and extracellular matrix-related genes. (D) Disease Ontology (DO)
  analysis of DEGs in WDR73 KO transcriptome. The top 20 most significantly enriched
  DO pathways are shown. (E) The Venn diagram used to identify the overlap DEGs of
  focal adhesion pathway and kidney disease, up arrow: up-regulated genes, down arrow:
  down-regulated genes. The ‘Count’ legend in (A,D) denotes the number of hit DEGs
  in the corresponding KEGG pathway or DO term.'
