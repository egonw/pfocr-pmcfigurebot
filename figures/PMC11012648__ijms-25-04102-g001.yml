caption: Cellular localization of CSC markers, pathways, and factors associated with
  CSCs in solid tumors as therapeutic targets. Schematic representation depicting
  the intracellular and membrane-bound distribution of key CSC markers, pathways,
  and factors associated with CSCs ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, ALDH2, ALDH3A1, EpCAM, CD44,
  CD133, CD55, CXCR4, SOX2, Notch, Nanog, and SHH. Arrows depict signaling pathway
  intermediates.
