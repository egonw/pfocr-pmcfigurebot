caption: Biological characteristics of different risk score groups in the TCGA cohort.
  (A) MsigDB-based GSVA analysis describing the biological properties of the two nucleotide
  metabolism-related score groups. (B) Metascape-based enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes between the two risk-scoring groups. (C) t-SNE plots of both GO
  and Reactome terms describing the differences in nucleotide metabolic pathway activities
  in the two risk-scoring groups. (D) . GSEA of GO and KEGG terms for the risk signature.
