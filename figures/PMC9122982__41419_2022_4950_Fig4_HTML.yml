figure_title: METTL3 knockdown enhances EphA2 and VEGFA mRNA stability via an m6A-IGF2BP2/3-dependent
  pathway
caption: A The association of EphA2/VEGFA and m6A readers in colon cancer analyzed
  based on TCGA database. B The mRNA expression of IGF2BP2/3 in colon cancer analyzed
  using the GEPIA website tool based on TCGA. C, D Real-time PCR and western blot
  assay of EphA2 and VEGFA expression in HCT116 cells after depletion of m6A readers
  (IGF2BP2/3). E, F The decay rate of mRNA and qPCR analysis of EphA2 and VEGFA at
  the indicated times after actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) treatment in HCT116 cells after
  METTL3 inhibition. G–J The decay rate of mRNA and qPCR analysis of EphA2 and VEGFA
  at the indicated times after actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) treatment in HCT116 cells after
  IGF2BP2/3 inhibition. p values were calculated using the t test from three independent
  experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 (Student’s t test).
article_title: m6A methylated EphA2 and VEGFA through IGF2BP2/3 regulation promotes
  vasculogenic mimicry in colorectal cancer via PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling.
