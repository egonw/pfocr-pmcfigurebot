caption: DPA promoted osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. (A-B) Under osteogenic
  inducing medium (OIM) conditions, hBMSCs were treated with the indicated concentrations
  of DPA for 14 days and the mineralization was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining
  (ARS) and ALP activity. (C-E) The osteogenesis-related gene expression (including
  ALP, OPN and OCN) of DPA-treated (0, 10, 20, 40 ÂµM) hBMSCs was measured by qRT-PCR
  (C) and western blot (D-E) assays. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs OIM group.
