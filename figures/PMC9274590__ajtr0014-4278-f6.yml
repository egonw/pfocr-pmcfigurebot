caption: Effect of RAGE inhibitors on RAGE/NF-κBp65 signaling pathway in LPS-induced
  cell. A. The LPS concentrations and growth inhibition rate curve (n = 3). B. TNF-α,
  IL-6, and IL-1β levels in supernatant were evaluated using ELISA. The bars represent
  the means ± SEMs (n = 4 per group). C. Different concentrations of FPS-ZM1 on LPS-induced
  tight junctions and expression of RAGE protein. D. mRNA expression levels of RAGE
  in different groups. E. Western blot analysis of p-IKBα and p-p65 in different groups.
  Quantifications of migrated cells from three independent experiments. F. mRNA expression
  levels of p-IKBα and p-p65 in different groups. The bars represent the means ± SEMs
  (n = 3 per group). aP < 0.05 and bP < 0.01 vs the Control group; cP < 0.05 and dP
  < 0.01 vs the LPS group; eP < 0.05 and fP < 0.01 vs the 500 nM+LPS group; gP < 0.05,
  hP < 0.01 vs the 1000 nM + LPS group.
