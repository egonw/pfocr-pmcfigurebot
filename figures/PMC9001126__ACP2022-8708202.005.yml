caption: MSCs and MSC-exosomes reduced apoptosis and promoted autophagy in the polyploid
  A549 and H1299 cells. (a, b) Apoptosis analysis of the polyploid A549 and H1299
  cells following coculture with MSC-CM, MSCs, and MSC-exosomes was examined by flow
  cytometry at 48 hours. (c) Stained with anti-LC3A/B antibody to detect the LC3 puncta
  and DAPI to detect nuclei by immunofluorescence using a fluorescence microscope
  (Ã—200).
