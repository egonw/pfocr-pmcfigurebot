caption: Administration of eupatilin ameliorated the progression of the puncture-induced
  model of IDD in vivo. (A) Puncture-induced model of IDD treated for 4 weeks with
  or without eupatilin were scanned with animal X-ray and MRI in the rat. (B) Quantitative
  statistical analysis (n = 3) according to the result of (A) of the intervertebral
  disc height index (DHI, %). (D) IVD of hematoxylin and eosin staining and safranin
  O-Fast green staining results. Scale bar, 500 μm. (C) Histological score was statistically
  analyzed according to the results in (D) (n = 3). (E) Results of COL2A1 immunofluorescence
  staining of IVD. Scale bar, 500 μm. (F) IOD value/area was statistically analyzed,
  according to the results in (E). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. n = 3, compared
  with the PBS group. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.
