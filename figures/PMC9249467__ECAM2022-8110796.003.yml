caption: PF-04691502 inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in bladder cancer cells. (a)
  T-24 and 5637 cells were treated with the indicated doses of PF-04691502 for 24
  (h) and the levels of specific proteins were measured using western blot. (b) T-24
  and 5637 cells were transfected with an empty vector (EV) or a vector expressing
  myr-Akt (OV Akt) for 12 h; then, the cells were treated with or without PF-04691502
  for another 24 h and the specific proteins were measured using western blots. (c)
  T-24 and 5637 cells were treated as indicated above, and cellular apoptosis was
  measured. (d) Cellular viabilities of the cells were measured. Data are representative
  of at least three independent experiments (∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01).
