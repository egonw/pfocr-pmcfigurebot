caption: Ghrelin’s multifunctional role in different systems regulating homeostasis.
  Ghrelin is involved in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis, the digestive system,
  the cardiovascular system, emotional feedback, cachexia, and other aspects, and
  it is necessary to take all of these aspects into consideration. It is worth exploring
  whether these factors’ involvement in the downstream pathway regulated by ghrelin
  can link the various systems.
