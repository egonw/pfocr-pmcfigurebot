caption: 'An outline of the FGF signaling pathway and a list of related factors described
  in this review: Factors involved in NPB (A), NC/PPE/NNE (B), and posterior placode
  (C) formation are shown. Properties of each factor and their actions on targets
  are shown by color and by arrows. Factors involved in PPE formation are shown in
  red or orange.'
