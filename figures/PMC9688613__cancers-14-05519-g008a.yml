caption: 'CLEFMA induced the apoptosis of human OSCC via the regulation of p38/ HO-1
  signalling cascade. (A,B) HSC-3 and (C,D) SCC-9 cells were pre-treated with UO126,
  JNK in 8, or SB203580 for 2 h before CLEFMA (8 μM) treatment for 24 h and untreated
  cells. Western blot assay was conducted. The quantification data are shown in the
  bar graph using densitometric measurement (ratio to β-actin). * p < 0.05 compared
  with the control group; # p < 0.05 compared with the 8 μM CLEFMA treated group.'
