caption: 'Exogenous expression of SAV1 attenuates lung cancer stem cell traits by
  inhibiting WNT signaling. (A) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed
  on the expressed genes found in NSCLC cell lines with and without forced SAV1 expression,
  and the top 10 GSEA gene clusters were displayed. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed transcripts. (C, D) Heatmap (C) shows the differentially
  expressed genes related to the WNT signaling pathway in NSCLC cell lines, and the
  enrichment score (D) was shown. C represents control; S represents transduced SAV1.
  (E) Luciferase reporter assay (TOPflash) in NSCLC cell lines transfected with SAV1
  and without. (F) The effect of SAV1 on the subcellular localization of β-catenin
  was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining for endogenous β-catenin (red)
  along with DAPI for DNA (blue). Scale bar: 50 µm. (G) Flow cytometry analysis of
  the indicated surface markers on NSCLC cell lines with and without forced SAV1 expression.
  (H, I) Sphere formation assay was performed and the sphere number was measured.
  Results represent means ± SD of at least two independent experiments. Statistical
  significance: p< 0.05 (Student''s t-test). Scale bar: 50 µm.'
