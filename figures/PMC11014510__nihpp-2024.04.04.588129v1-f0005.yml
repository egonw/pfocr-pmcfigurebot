figure_title: Pervasive loss of regulated cell death genes in Afrotheria, particularly
  Paenungulates
caption: A. Lost genes are statistically enriched in subcellular compartments () and
  Reactome pathways () related to regulated cell death modes; bubbleplot shows the
  enrichment ratio and −log10 hypergeometric P-value of enriched terms (FDR≤0.10).B.
  Lost genes are enriched in protein-protein interaction network clusters in STRING
  related to pyroptosis, TRAIL-activated apoptotic signaling, and the execution phase
  of necroptosis (FDR≤0.10). STRING interaction networks show protein-protein interactions
  with a line, and lost genes are shown with filled circles.C. Gene losses in Afritheria.
  Phylogenetic relationships between species are shown on the right. Genes are grouped
  into those that function in necroptosis (blue), the tumor necrosis factor receptor
  (TNFR) complex (grey), and pyroptosis (yellow). Proteins that promote cell death
  are indicated with arrowheads, and those that inhibit cell death are shown with
  blunt arrows (┴). Bubbleplot is colored by TOGA annotation and manual verification.
