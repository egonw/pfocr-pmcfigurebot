caption: Cell proliferation in vitro. (A) CCK-8 assay for cell viability. (B) The
  cell cycle distribution rate. (C) Flow cytometry with PI staining represents the
  cell cycle distribution. Data are presented as the mean Â± SEM. One-way ANOVA and
  post-hoc Tukey's multiple comparisons test were used to determine statistically
  significant differences (n=3 per group). *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. CON,
  control; CKI, compound Kushen injection; Ang II, angiotensin II; LY, LY294002 (an
  inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway).
article_title: Compound Kushen injection attenuates angiotensin II-mediated heart
  failure by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway.
