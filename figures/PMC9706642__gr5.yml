caption: 'FGF23 regulates ALP activity through the ERK signaling pathway. Effect of
  Adv-FGF23 (107 pfu/mL) and ERK inhibitor (10 μM) on ALP mRNA expression (a), ALP
  activity, which is shown as U/g protein (b), and relative protein expression of
  P-ERK and ERK (c) for 48 h in BMSCs-differentiated osteoblasts. Data are presented
  as Means ± SD (n = 6): ⁎⁎⁎P < 0.001 vs. Adv-GFP.'
