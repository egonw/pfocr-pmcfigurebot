caption: 'Quercetin-lycopene combination suppressed H2O2-upregulated inflammatory-related
  gene expression. (A) Scatter plot of differentially expressed genes (DEG) between
  H2O2 and M2 treated group. M2: LYP: Q = 1:5. (B) GO enrichment analyses of DEGs
  between H2O2 treated group and M2 treated group. (C) Heatmap of enriched DEGs in
  the GO analysis term “Inflammatory response”. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  plots showing altered genes related to the NF-κB signaling pathway. The plots were
  based on the results from KEGG analysis of differentially expressed genes between
  H2O2 treated group and M2 group. NES, normalized enrichment score. FDR, false discovery
  rate. Green line indicates an enrichment profile, black vertical lines indicate
  hits, and gray vertical lines show ranking metric scores. (E–G) RT-qPCR analysis
  show the altered inflammatory genes by quercetin, lycopene, or M2. (H) Western blotting
  analysis of NF-κB p65 expression in HUVEC cells. n = 3 in each group. Different
  letters above the bar indicated a significant difference (p < 0.05) among groups.
  Q: quercetin; L: luteolin; LY: lycopene; LU: lutein; M2: LYP: Q = 1:5. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
