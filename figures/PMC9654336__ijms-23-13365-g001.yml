caption: Changes in expression levels of MPAS genes induced by MEK/ERK pathway activity
  modulation in PEO4 cells. (A) Immunoblotting analysis of phosphorylation of MEK/ERK
  pathway components in response to treatment with FGF4 (100 ng/mL). Numbers under
  the bands represent relative intensity normalized to GAPDH levels and control samples.
  (B) Changes in expression of MPAS genes in FGF4-treated cells. Heatmap represents
  gene expression levels normalized to control samples. Unsupervised hierarchical
  clustering was performed using 1-minus Spearman’s rank correlation metrics. (C)
  Experimental design for enrichment of cultured cells in different phases of cell
  cycle (see Methods for details). Aph—aphidicolin. (D) Immunoblotting analysis of
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation changes during cell cycle progression in synchronized cells.
  Numbers under the bands represent relative intensity normalized to GAPDH levels
  and control samples. (E) Changes in expression of MPAS genes during cell cycle progression.
  Heatmap represents gene expression levels normalized to control samples. Unsupervised
  hierarchical clustering was performed using 1-minus Spearman’s rank correlation
  metrics.
