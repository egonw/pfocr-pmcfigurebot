caption: 'CASC2 overexpression inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
  A. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of CASC2 in Colo-678 and HCT116 cells
  transfected with the CASC2 overexpression plasmid. B, C. MTT and BrdU assays were
  employed to detect the proliferation of CRC cells with CASC2 overexpression (scale
  bar: 100 μm). D, E. Transwell assay was used to detect the migration and invasion
  of CRC cells with CASC2 overexpression (scale bar: 250 μm). The data were analyzed
  by independent samples t test or one-way ANOVA. Data are represented as the mean
  ± SD (n=3). *; P<0.05, **; P<0.01, ***; P<0.001, NC; Negative control, CRC; Colorectal
  cancer, qRT-PCR; Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction, MTT; Methylthiazol
  tetrazolium, and BrdU; 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine.'
