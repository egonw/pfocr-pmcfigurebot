caption: CuB reduces the m6A mRNA stability via directly targeting IGF2BP1. (A) Effects
  of CuB treatment of 24 h on c-MYC and KRAS mRNA expression in Huh7 cells by RT-PCR.
  (B) KRAS and c-MYC mRNA stability changes in Huh7 cells upon CuB treatment. (C)
  Effects of CuB treatment of 24 h on KRAS and c-MYC expression levels in Huh7 cells
  by a western blot. (D) Fluorescence in situ hybridization images of labeled c-MYC
  RNA upon CuB treatment for 24 h in Huh7 cells. White arrows indicate overlapped
  signals. (E) Heat map of differentially regulated proteins involved in significantly
  canonical pathways after treatment with CuB for 12 h in Huh7 cells. (F) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis for the significantly differentially regulated protein predicted
  the significantly canonical pathways. (G) HuR, MATR3, and PABPC1 interaction with
  IGF2BP1 was inhibited by CuB in Huh7 cells after 12 h of treatment, respectively.
  (H) Schematic of IGF2BP1-m6A mRNA interaction and partners regulation in response
  to CuB treatment. Data are shown as mean Â± SD. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 vs Ctrl
  group. ns, not significant.
