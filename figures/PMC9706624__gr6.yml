caption: 'Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis. (A) Heatmap of correlations
  between differential genes and differential metabolites. The red and blue colors
  represent positive and negative correlations between transcriptomics and metabolomics,
  respectively. “*,” “**,” and “***” represents P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001,
  respectively, and indicate the significant difference between genes and metabolites.
  (B) Transcriptome and metabolome coenrich the KEGG pathway. KEGG analysis of DAMs
  and DEGs between the control and probiotics groups. (C) Probiotics regulate cecal
  metabolic pathways in heat-stressed broilers. Boxes indicate genes, circles indicate
  metabolites, red indicates upregulation, blue indicates downregulation, and black
  indicates no difference. Abbreviation: DEGs, differentially expressed genes'
article_title: Transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal the regulatory effects
  of compound probiotics on cecal metabolism in heat-stressed broilers.
