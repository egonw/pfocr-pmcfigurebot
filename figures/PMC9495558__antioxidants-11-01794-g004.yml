caption: 'The effects of DHPA on the related antioxidant indices in SH-SY5Y cells.
  Intracellular ROS fluorescence images (A), intracellular ROS production (B,C), the
  content of MDA (D), and the activities of SOD (E) and GSH (F). For (C), the cells
  were pre-treated with Aβ/Cu2+/AA for 6 h, and washed afterward, with different concentrations
  of DHPA added. For the other experiments, Aβ/Cu2+/AA and DHPA were mixed for cell
  incubation. ## p < 0.01 compared to the control group, ** p < 0.01 compared to the
  Aβ/Cu2+/AA-treated group.'
