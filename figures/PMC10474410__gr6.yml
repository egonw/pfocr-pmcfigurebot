caption: 'miR-5195-3p suppressed the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in melanoma cells
  via PCBP2. (A) The protein expression levels of PCNA, E-cadherin, p-PI3K, PI3K,
  p-AKT and AKT were measured in A375 and A2058 cells after co-transfection with miR-5195-3p
  mimics and pcDNA3.1-PCBP2 or pcDNA3.1. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, compared with miR-NC + pcDNA3.1;
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, compared with miR-5195-3p mimics + pcDNA3.1, by ANOVA with
  Tukey''s post hoc test. (B) The protein expression levels of PCNA, E-cadherin, p-PI3K,
  PI3K, p-AKT and AKT were measured in A375 and A2058 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-PCBP2,
  followed by treatment with LY294002. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, compared with pcDNA3.1;
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, compared with pcDNA3.1-PCBP2, by ANOVA with
  Tukey''s post hoc test. The experiments were replicated three times and presented
  as mean ± SD.'
