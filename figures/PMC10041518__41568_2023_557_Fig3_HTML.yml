figure_title: Altered nucleoside handling facilitates cancer cell immune evasion
caption: a, Cancer cell-directed adenosine build-up in the tumour microenvironment
  dampens anticancer immunity by signalling to various immune cell subsets. Extracellular
  ATP, which is a powerful immunostimulatory molecule, is cleared by CD39 and CD73,
  which are overexpressed in cancer cells. This process yields adenosine, which is
  immunosuppressive. Adenosine can also be directly exported from cancer cells through
  equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2 (ENT1/2). Extracellular adenosine
  dampens the antitumour activity of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic
  cells (DCs); it also promotes the immunosuppressive activity of tumour-associated
  macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby facilitating
  cancer cell immune evasion. b, The multifunctional purine catabolism enzyme fatty
  acid metabolism–immunity nexus (FAMIN) serves as a biochemical immune checkpoint
  by dampening DC-mediated T cell priming. Genetic inactivation of FAMIN in DCs accelerates
  antigen presentation downstream of cytosolic acidification resulting from increased
  NADH production by inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IMPDH1/2).
  FAMIN inactivation also abolishes DC secretion of inosine, which normally signals
  through adenosine receptors on T cells to depress T cell activation during priming.
