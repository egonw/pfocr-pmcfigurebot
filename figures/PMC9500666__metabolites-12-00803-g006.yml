caption: The MAPK signaling pathway was involved in NEFA−induced apoptosis. (A) The
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the different NEFA treatment−activated genes.
  (B) Thermogram analysis of expressions of MAPK pathway−related genes. (C) The protein
  expression of MAPK pathway−related genes in BMECs stimulated with NEFA for 6 h.
  Data are presented as the means ± the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
