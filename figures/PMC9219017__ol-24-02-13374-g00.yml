caption: FABP7 is expressed at low levels in CSCC tissues and cell lines. (A) RT-qPCR
  was used to detect the expression levels of FABP7 in the punch biopsies from CSCC
  and NLES samples. (B) The FABP7 protein expression was detect by immunohistochemistry
  assay (Scale bar, 50 µm). ‘#2’ and ‘#4’ refer to the patient ID. (C) The expression
  levels of FABP7 in human CSCC cell lines A431, colo-16 and SCL-1 and immortalized
  human normal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT were detected by RT-qPCR. (D) The protein
  expression levels of FABP7 in human CSCC and HaCaT cells were detected by western
  blotting. (E) Kaplan-Meier survival curves of patients in the FABP7 high- and low-expression
  groups. **P<0.01 vs. HaCaT. FABP7, fatty acid-binding protein 7; CSCC, cutaneous
  squamous cell carcinoma; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; NLES,
  non-lesion epithelial skin.
article_title: FABP7 inhibits proliferation and invasion abilities of cutaneous squamous
  cell carcinoma cells via the Notch signaling pathway.
