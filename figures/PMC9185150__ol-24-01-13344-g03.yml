caption: Effect of BPTF or Raf1 on the proliferation of T-cell lymphoma. (A) mRNA
  and (B) protein expression levels of BPTF and Raf1 in H9 cells and Hut-102 cells.
  ***P<0.001 vs. H9 cells. (C) Confirmation of successful silencing of Raf1 in Hut-102
  cells by shRaf1. ***P<0.001 vs. NC. (D) Cell viability of Hut-102 cells transfected
  with shBPTF, shRaf1 or NC. MTT assays were performed 24 h after transfection. ***P<0.001
  vs. NC. (E) Representative micrographs (left) and relative quantification (right)
  from colony formation assays. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. NC. (F) Flow cytometry plots
  and quantitative analysis of Annexin V/propidium iodide staining assay. ***P<0.001
  vs. NC. (G) Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle phase distribution assay. Histograms
  depict the proportion of Hut-102 cells in G1, S and G2 phases. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001
  vs. NC. (H) Western blot analysis of Bax, Bcl-2, and Î²-actin. The histogram depicts
  the signal ration of Bax/Bcl-2. ***P<0.001 vs. NC. BPTF, bromodomain PHD finger
  transcription factor; NC, negative control; sh, short hairpin.
