caption: Analysis of metabolic pathways for DEMs. (A) Enrichment analysis of KEGG
  pathways of metabolites with significant differences in abundance among treatments.
  The X-axis displays the ratio of DEMs within the pathway to the total number of
  identified metabolites. Higher ratios indicate greater enrichment of DEMs in the
  pathway. Point color indicates the P-value from the hypergeometric test, with smaller
  values indicating higher reliability and statistical significance. Dot size corresponds
  to the number of DEMs within each pathway; larger dots represent more DEMs. (B)
  Evaluation of co-expressed DEMs across diverse treatment conditions. (C) Enrichment
  of co-expressed DEMs in metabolic pathways based on the average expression ratio
  between sample groups (Log2 FC). Positive values signify upregulation, while negative
  values indicate downregulation.
