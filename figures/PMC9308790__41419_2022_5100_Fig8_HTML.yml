figure_title: Schematic diagram of the molecular mechanisms underlying TRIM25-regulated
  DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
caption: A schematic model illustrating that TRIM25 regulates the p85α/XBP-1s/CHOP
  signaling pathway under ER stress to decrease myocardial apoptosis. TRIM25, which
  is downregulated after treatment with DOX, could alleviate ER stress by targeting
  p85α for ubiquitination and degradation, leading to increased XBP-1s transferring
  to the nucleus.

  by degrading p85α.
