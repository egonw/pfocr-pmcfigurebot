caption: Exercise training differentially alters the serine-sphingolipid muscle metabolite
  networks in diet-sensitive and diet-resistant women with obesity. (a-e) Enriched
  metabolite networks reveal differing profiles in vastus lateralis from DR and DS
  individuals at BL and PET. (a) The correlation network for plasma serine. Shown
  are partners with distance correlation > 0.7; P<0.02, (n=10). (b) Selection of the
  most significantly different sphingolipid features in vastus lateralis. Shown are
  features with ReliefF weight measure over 0.03 (major contributors to a classification
  model), (n=5). (C) Immunoblot analyses revealed relative protein expression of SPTLC1
  did not differ between DR and DS, whereas expression of SPTLC2 was lower in DR skeletal
  muscle following exercise training. (*P<0.05, Two-way ANOVA for repeated-measures
  with Holm-Sidak post hoc test, n=9). (d) Heatmap clustering of relative sphingolipid
  level changes compared to the total sample mean in the DS and DR groups before and
  after exercise. Data were log-transformed and z-scored. (e) Sphingolipid metabolic
  pathway indicating network correlations are distinct in DR and DS groups at baseline.
  Direction of arrows indicates direction of correlation; arrow colours indicate correlations
  between sphingolipid species at the beginning (serine) or end (O-phosphorylethanolamine
  (PE)) of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in either the DR or DS groups. The number
  of species with significant correlations in each subclass (absolute correlation
  level over 0.6 with P<0.05) are indicated. Data in bar graphs represent mean ± SEM.
  (*P< 0.05, t‐test with Welch's correction, n=5). See also Figure S4.
