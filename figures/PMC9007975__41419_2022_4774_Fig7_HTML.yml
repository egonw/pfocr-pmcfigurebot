figure_title: p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α rescues the hearing loss in AHL mice
caption: 'A Timeline for ABR testing and drug treatment. Pifithrin-α was administered
  to 8-month-old WT mice at 1.1 or 2.2 mg/kg every other day, for 30 days. B, C ABR
  thresholds in response to click (B) or pure-tone stimuli (C) were applied in Young,
  AHL, AHL + saline, AHL + 1.1 mg/kg pifithrin-α (PFT-α), and AHL + 2.2 mg/kg (PFT-α)
  mice. D, E Changes in SGN morphology and density in Young, AHL, AHL + saline, AHL + 1.1 mg/kg
  PFT-α, and AHL + 2.2 mg/kg PFT-α mice. F Immunofluorescence images showed alterations
  of HCs in mice in different treatment groups. G, H Quantification of OHCs (G) and
  IHCs (H) at the cochlea’s apical middle and basal regions in Young, AHL, and PFT-α
  treated mice. Scale bar: 20 µm in D, 10 µm in (F). Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
  **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
