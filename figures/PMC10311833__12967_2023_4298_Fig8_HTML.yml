caption: Heatmaps of differential mRNA expression and related pathway dysregulation
  scores for 760 molecules in the kidney after ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injury analyzed
  by the NanoString mouse nCounter Fibrosis Panel. a Differential mRNA expression
  map in IR-injured kidney between untreated (wild type, WT) and KH3-treated wild
  type mice(KH3) (n = 5/each group) compared to uninjured contralateral kidney (CTL),
  generated by using the limma software. b Dysregulation score map of 50 annotated
  profibrotic pathways in those kidneys generated by using nSlover™. c The top 20
  upregulated profibrotic pathways and d Five down-regulated cellular energy metabolic
  pathways induced by IR injury, compared with the pathway scores in uninjured contralateral
  kidney (CTL) are remarkably ameliorated when KH3 was given
