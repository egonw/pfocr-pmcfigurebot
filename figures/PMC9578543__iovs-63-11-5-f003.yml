caption: H&E staining of ocular tissue sections showing histopathological features
  of the choroid of 4-week-old guinea pigs. The results indicate that the structural
  arrangement of the choroidal tissue in the NC group was denser and the capillary
  vascular structure was tighter than that in the LIM group, whereas the structural
  arrangement within the choroidal stroma of the LIM group was looser, with more obvious
  fracture dissolution and more sparse vascularity. Magnification, 400Ã—.
