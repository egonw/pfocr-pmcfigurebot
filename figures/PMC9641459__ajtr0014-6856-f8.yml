caption: Overexpression of BTRC regulated the IκBα/NFκB signaling pathway and blocked
  the protective effects of Exo against CLP-induced organ injury. (A) Protein level
  of BTRC and phosphorylation of IκBα/NF-κB in murine lung, kidney and liver tissues
  examined by western blot analysis; (B-D) Pathological changes in murine lung (B),
  kidney (C) and liver (D) tissues after Exo treatment and LV-BTRC transfection determined
  by H&E staining. In each group, n = 6. Differences were analyzed by two-way ANOVA
  (A) or the unpaired t test (B and D). *P < 0.05 vs. Exo + LV-NC. BTRC, beta-transducin
  repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; CLP, cecal ligation and puncture.
