caption: 'Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic data to exhibit the anthocyanin
  synthesis pathway in the germination seeds of cultivar rice and landrace. A heatmap
  represents the folds of the expression levels of the corresponding structural genes
  in the seeds of landraces and cultivated rice, and from red to green in the heatmap
  indicates the expression levels of structural genes ranging from low to high. Genes
  in anthocyanin synthesis are shown as follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase; 3GT, flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransfers;
  GT1, glucosyltransferase 1; GT4, glucosyltransferase 4.'
