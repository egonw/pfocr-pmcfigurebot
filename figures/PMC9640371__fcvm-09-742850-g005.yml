caption: Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the process of aortic valve calcification. Schematic
  showing the proposed model where calcification is initiated with reduced NO availability
  that perturbs integrin signaling pathway, cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions,
  followed by dysregulation of various cellular signaling pathways.
article_title: Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of aortic valve interstitial cells
  demonstrates the regulation of integrin signaling by nitric oxide.
