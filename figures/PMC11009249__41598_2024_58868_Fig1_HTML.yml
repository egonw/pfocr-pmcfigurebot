caption: 'Summary of the induced immune response. (A) Employed immunization scheme
  and days of analysis. (B) Schematic representation of the bioassays to assess IgG
  secretion and affinity. The IgG secretion and affinity bioassay was a relocation
  sandwich immunoassay consisting of paramagnetic nanoparticles that form an elongated
  object in a magnetic field. Fluorescence images of the bioassays after 50 min are
  shown. Scale bar 50 μm. (C) Frequency of IgG-SCs (4 mice with measurements in the
  presence and the absence of the lactate assay, i.e., nmeasurements = 8, Grubb''s
  test was used to identify outliers). Cells with an IgG secretion rate equal or above
  the LoD (≥ 3 IgG/s) were defined as IgG-SCs. (D) The distribution of IgG secretion
  rates of IgG-SCs in the spleen (blue, left) and bone marrow (red, right) during
  the immune response. Data from four mice were pooled for the respective anatomical
  compartment and day (ncells = 187, 46, 96, and 82 in the spleen on days 0–14, ncells = 35,
  37, 140, and 133 in the bone marrow on days 0–14). The percentage above the dotted
  line indicated the frequency of cells with an IgG secretion rate equal or above
  the assay''s quantitative range (≥ 375 IgG/s). (E) The distribution of affinity
  slopes of IgG-SCs in the spleen (blue, left) and bone marrow (red, right) during
  the immune response. Data from four mice were pooled for the respective anatomical
  compartment and day (ncells = 85, 40, 56, and 74 in the spleen on days 0–14, ncells = 28,
  30, 140, and 120 in the bone marrow on days 0–14). (F,G) Analysis of gene expression
  changes of DEGs (average log twofold change) of selected metabolic pathways in IgG-ECs
  of the (E) spleen and (F) bone marrow on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. For the gene markers
  used to identify IgG-ECs, please refer to SITable 1. Cells from two mice were pooled
  in a ratio of 1:1 prior to scRNA-Seq, and sequences in the range of 800–5′500 cells
  were analyzed. Legend: pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid (FA) synthesis, and FA β-oxidation
  (FA oxidation). For definition of glycolysis, lactate metabolism and TCA cycle see
  SIFigure 3. The level of statistical significance is denoted as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001. Panel B was created with BioRender.com.'
