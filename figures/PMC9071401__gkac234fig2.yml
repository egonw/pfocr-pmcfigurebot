caption: 'Global transcriptional changes induced by SETDB1 LOF correlate with malignant
  phenotype attenuation (A) Volcano plot showing significant SETDB1 LOF-induced changes
  in gene expression in A549 cells (N = 3 independent experiments; FDR < 0.01, t-test
  relative to a threshold). Up-regulated genes (red): 1887 (log2(fold change) > 0).
  Down-regulated genes (blue): 961 (log2(fold change) < 0). (B) Gene ontology terms
  over-represented in the differentially expressed genes in SETDB1LOFvs. control A549
  cells. (C) Gene set enrichment analysis in SETDB1LOFvs. control A549 cells. Normalized
  enrichment score (NES) and FDR are indicated. (D) Gene set variation analysis scores
  for each gene set in the normal lung (N = 48), NSCLC (N = 61), control (cyan), and
  SETDB1LOF (pink) A549 cells. Dashed vertical lines correspond to the median, 25th
  and 75th percentiles. (E) mRNA expression of selected mesenchymal and epithelial
  markers, and genes related to the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in control (cyan)
  and SETDB1LOF (pink) A549 cells. RT-qPCR data were normalized to the PPIA mRNA expression
  values in control A549 cells that were set as 100% (N ≥ 3 independent experiments;
  mean ± SEM; *P-value < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test). (F) Effect of rescued expression
  of SETDB1 on mRNA expression of selected mesenchymal and epithelial markers, and
  genes related to the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in A549 SETDB1LOF transfected
  with pcDNA3.1(+)-IRES-GFP or pcDNA3.1(+)-SETDB1WT-IRES-GFP. RT-qPCR data were normalized
  to the PPIA mRNA expression values in A549 SETDB1LOF transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-IRES-GFP
  that were set as 100% (N = 3 independent experiments; mean ± SEM; *P-value < 0.05,
  Mann–Whitney U-test). (G) mRNA expression of selected mesenchymal and epithelial
  markers, and genes related to the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in control (N = 8
  mice, cyan) and SETDB1LOF A549 xenografts (N = 7 mice, pink) (see Figure ). RT-qPCR
  data were normalized to the PPIA expression values in control A549 xenografts that
  were set as 100% (mean ± SEM; ns, not significant, ***P-value < 0.001, Mann–Whitney
  U-test).'
