caption: Potential IFN-γ/STAT1 Signaling Mechanisms in Neurons. The exact mechanisms
  of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling in neurons are unknown. In canonical IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling,
  IFN-γ binds the IFNGR, causing JAK1/2 to recruit and phosphorylate STAT1. STAT1
  then disassociates from the IFNGR complex and translocates to the nucleus as a homodimer,
  where it can regulate transcription of ISGs. Neurons do upregulate ISGs in response
  to IFN-γ in a STAT1-dependent manner. However, the timing and kinetics of STAT1
  activation differ from other cells, suggesting neurons may utilize non-canonical
  signaling mechanisms. The existence of non-canonical IFN-γ/STAT1 has been understudied,
  especially in neurons. Non-canonical signaling includes intracellular roles for
  IFN-γ, translocation of the entire IFN-γ/IFNGR1/JAK1/2/STAT1 complex to the nucleus,
  and non-transcriptional roles for STAT1 in the cytoplasm. STAT1 activation in neurons
  is delayed and extended, but it is unclear how or why this occurs. Though it has
  not been studied, we speculate that activation of the IFN-γ/STAT1 pathway in neurons
  at different subcellular locations may result in different outcomes, especially
  if activation occurs at a distal site such as on axons or dendrites versus on the
  soma. IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling also regulates neural activity, which occurs on the
  timescale of minutes, and JAK2/STAT1 activation regulates the elimination of specifically
  inactive axons and synapses. In these scenarios, we speculate that IFN-γ/STAT1 may
  utilize non-canonical mechanisms, which may allow for rapid and site-specific action.
  Non-transcriptional roles for cytoplasmic STAT1 could facilitate local effects at
  the synapse via direct interaction of STAT1 with neurotransmitter receptors, like
  GABAR and AMPAR, and/or other intermediates like PKC which have been implicated
  in IFN-γ-regulated neural activity
