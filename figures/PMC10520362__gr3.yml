caption: Foxl1+ telocytes express intestinal stem cell niche signaling factors in
  a region-specific manner. Foxl1+ telocytes compartmentalize expression of signaling
  molecules, as telocytes residing at the crypt base express Wnt ligands and agonists
  that contribute to a high Wnt signaling environment (Wnt2b, Rspo3). Foxl1+ telocytes
  further up the crypt express Wnt antagonists and BMP ligands that contribute to
  a high BMP signaling environment (BMP5, dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor
  3 [Dkk3]). Intestinal epithelial cells are as described in the legend of . Figure created
