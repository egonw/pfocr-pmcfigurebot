caption: 'The number of subchondral osteoclasts in mandibular condyle in control group
  and experimental group. A: TRAP staining in the mandibular condylar subchondral
  bone was performed and multinucleated osteoclasts are indicated. B: TRAP-positive
  osteoclasts of the analysis of quantitative. C: Increased mRNA expressing levels
  of RANK and decreased mRNA expressing of OPG in condylar subchondral bone. The data
  were expressed as mean ± SD and ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.'
article_title: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in the progress of mandibular
  condylar cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss induced by overloaded
  functional orthopedic force (OFOF).
