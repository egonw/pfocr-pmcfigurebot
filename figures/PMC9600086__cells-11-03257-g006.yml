caption: (a) Regulation of the natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR2)-C-type natriuretic
  peptide (CNP)-cGMP pathway by PDEs throughout the aging of IMR-hPSC-CMs in culture
  from day 30 to day 90. Model traces of cGMP production after the situation via CNP
  and subsequent (b) PDE1 inhibition via vinpocetine (VIMPO), (c) PDE2 inhibition
  via EHNA, (d) PDE3 inhibition via Cilostamine (CILO), (e) PDE5 inhibition via Sildenafil,
  and (f) PDE9 inhibition via PF-04447943 (PF-), and saturation via 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
  (IBMX). All data is composed of three independent experimental batches. * p < 0.1;
  **** p < 0.0001.
