caption: Pinoresinol and vanillic acid facilitating proliferation of mouse myoblasts
  in a dose-dependent manner. Cell proliferation activity measured by BrdU assay of
  pinoresinol and vanillic acid at various concentrations on C2C12 cells during the
  differentiation period. Data represent the mean Â± SEM, obtained from at least triplicate
  determinations. *** indicates p < 0.001 calculated by one-way ANOVA.
