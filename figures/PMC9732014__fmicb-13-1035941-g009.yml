caption: '(A) qRT-PCR detection of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α)
  in the mouse lung tissue. Compared with control group, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; Compared
  with infected group, #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01. (B) The working model of LHQW capsule
  against influenza A virus infection. (a) The lung infected with influenza A virus
  induces an immune response in lung, leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines
  into blood. (b) The inflammatory cytokines from the blood enter the intestinal wall
  to induce the immune response, resulting in intestinal wall injury. (c) The LPS
  from the intestine crosses the damaged intestinal mucosal barrier and enters the
  blood to activate the TLR4-mediated pathway in lung, causing the lung injury (d).'
article_title: Intestinal microbiota analysis and network pharmacology reveal the
  mechanism by which Lianhua Qingwen capsule improves the immune function of mice
  infected with influenza A virus.
