caption: The involvement of KLF10 in TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway and estrogen signaling
  pathway, and the regulation of KLF10 expression and function at multiple levels (A)
  TGFβ binds to its membrane receptor, triggering the phosphorylation of SMAD2/SMAD3.
  The activated SMAD2 and SMAD3 form oligomeric complexes with SMAD4, which will then
  translocate into the nucleus to increase the expression of KLF10. KLF10 can further
  enhance the transcription of Smad 2 and inhibit the transcription of Smad 7, which
  further activates the TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway. Estrogen binds to the intracellular
  estrogen receptor (ER) and then stimulates the expression of KLF10, which inhibits
  the transcription of BI-1 gene. The reduced expression of BI-1 induced the release
  of Ca2+ and consequently increased cell apoptosis in breast cancer. In addition,
  KLF10 can facilitate estrogen signaling-mediated increase of bone mineral density
  (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) (B) The expression and function of KLF10 can
  be regulated at multiple levels. TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway and estrogen signaling
  can promote the transcription of Klf10. JunB and KDM6A can bind to the Klf10 gene
  promoter to facilitate its transcription. SIAH1 and FBW7, two E3 ubiquitin ligases,
  can bind to KLF10 protein and promote its degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome
  pathway. ITCH can induce the ubiquitination of KLF10, which would enhance the function
  of KLF10 to transactivate Foxp3 gene expression in regulatory T cells (Treg cells),
  thereby protecting against airway inflammation. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of
  KLF10 can facilitate the effect of KLF10 on inhibiting lipogenic genes transcription.
  KLF10 and JARID1B can inhibit the transcription of Smad7 in a synergistic manner.
