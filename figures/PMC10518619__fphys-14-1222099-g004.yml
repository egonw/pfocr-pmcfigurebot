caption: mTOR pathway activation. ROS produced after the injury and produced because
  of hypoxia will generate a cellular response to produce less ATP to limit ROS as
  its residual product. Low ATP and hypoxia create nutrient scarcity in the cell and
  initiate AMPK to interact with the ULK1 complex, causing phosphorylation. Phosphorylation
  and separation of mTOR from the induction complex initiate autophagy. ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ULK1, unc-51-like autophagy-activating
  kinase 1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.
