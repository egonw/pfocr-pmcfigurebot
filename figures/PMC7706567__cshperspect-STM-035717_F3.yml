caption: Dynamic signaling in alveolar stem cells that sequentially drive proliferation
  and differentiation. Signaling pathway activity (dark shade indicates active) in
  alveolar type II (AT2) cells (top) and LNEP/DASC cells (bottom) during sequential
  steps of their regenerative programs. “Stem” indicates Axin2+ and “Bulk” indicates
  Axin2− AT2 cells. Dashed outlines represent dying cells.
