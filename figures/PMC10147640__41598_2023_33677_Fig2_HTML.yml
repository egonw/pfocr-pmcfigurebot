caption: Changes in ES value (y axis) as GSEA was run down the ordered gene list (x
  axis). The score at the highest or lowest peak of the plot is the ES score for the
  gene set. (a) ES = 0.479 (Table ) for the Reactome pathway Extracellular matrix
  organization (R-HAS-1474244); (b) ES = − 0.804 for Neurexins and neuroligins (R-HAS-6794361).
