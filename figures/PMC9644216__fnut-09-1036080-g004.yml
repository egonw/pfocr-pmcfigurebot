caption: (A) Genera were differentially abundant between baseline and week four for
  IF1-P participants (n = 10). (B) Genera that were differentially abundant between
  baseline and week four for IF2-P participants (n = 10). Points represent each generaâ€™s
  log2 fold change (log2FC; effect size). A positive value indicates that a feature
  increased in abundance at week four (right), and a negative value indicates a decrease
  in abundance at week four (left). Bars represent 95% confidence intervals derived
  from the ANCOM-BC model. Note, the genus Incertae Sedis is from the Ruminococcaceae
  family. Boxplots displaying statistically significant differences in (C) peptidoglycan
  biosynthesis II and (D) chorismate biosynthesis II from baseline to week four of
  predicted metabolic pathways for IF1-P participants. Boxplot displaying a statistically
  significant difference in (E) adenosine nucleotides degradation IV from baseline
  to week four of the predicted metabolic pathway for IF2-P participants. Pathways
  are displayed as centered log-ratio (CLR) transformed abundances. Boxes denote the
  interquartile range (IQR) between the first and third quartiles, and the horizontal
  line defines the median.
