caption: Boswellic acid biosynthesis-related enzymes and gene families in Boswellia
  sacra(A) Cyp450 gene families in the genome datasets of B. sacra.(B) The identification
  of Terpene synthase (TPS)-related gene families in B. sacra and its comparison with
  four species. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with a maximum likelihood (ML)
  approach using RAxML(8.1.16) with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The green color branches
  show high bootstrap values.(C) The significantly high DEGs related to terpenoid
  biosynthesis pathway in control versus wounding stress.(D) Proposed biosynthesis
  of resin synthesis in Boswellia based on genomic and transcriptomic datasets.
