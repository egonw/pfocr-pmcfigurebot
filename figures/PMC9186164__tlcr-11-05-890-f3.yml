caption: SNPs rs2568847 and rs922782 impacted the FOXP1 and RORA expression respectively
  and correlated with NSCLC survival. The eQTL analysis results for FOXP1 rs2568847
  (A) in whole blood samples in GTEx Project and RORA rs922782 (B) in 1000 Genomes
  Project. (C) Higher expression of FOXP1 were revealed in the normal tissues compared
  to both LUAD and LUSC samples. (D) Higher expression of RORA were revealed in the
  normal tissues compared to both LUAD and LUSC samples. (E) Higher FOXP1 expression
  was correlated with better survival in patients with NSCLC. (F) Higher RORA expression
  was correlated with better survival in patients with NSCLC. eQTL, expression quantitative
  trait loci; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; NSCLC,
  non-small cell lung cancer.
