caption: 'Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway gene expression is upregulated in XY mice
  in response to statin. A Heatmap displays relative hepatic expression levels of
  genes altered by sex within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as fold-change
  of statin treated compared to chow diet for each of the Four Core genotypes (N = 3
  per genotype and diet). * indicates gonadal sex effect and † indicates chromosomal
  sex effect. * or †P < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA. B–E Real-time PCR quantification of
  representative genes from A illustrates the effects of gonadal and/or chromosomal
  sex on statin-induced alterations in gene expression in the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway. Two-way ANOVA with * denoting gonadal sex effect and # denoting effect
  due to statin treatment. * or #P < 0.05 and ** or ##P < 0.01. N = 4–6. In two-way
  ANOVA analyses, two groups of mice were combined such that the number of mice in
  each group used for statistical analysis is 7–12'
