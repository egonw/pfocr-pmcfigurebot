caption: Degradative steps in JH III pathway. (a) JHEH promoter is inhibited by high
  titers of JH III and 20HE. During this time, JHEH is not synthesized. (b) After
  JH III is converted into JH IIIA (JH III acid) by JHE, the JHEH promoter is upregulated
  by TF Sp1, allowing the synthesis of JHEH, which converts JH IIIA into JH IIIAD
  (JH III acid diol).
