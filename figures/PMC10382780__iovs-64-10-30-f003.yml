caption: Blocking the Th2 signaling pathway inhibits IL-6 or IL-8 secretion from conjunctival
  epithelial cells. (A) The expression of IL-4Rα on the surface of IOBA-NHC cells.
  (B) IL-4 (left) and IL-13 (right) induced the secretion of IL-6 in IOBA-NHC cells.
  (C) IL-4 (left) and IL-13 (right) induced the secretion of IL-8 in IOBA-NHC cells.
  (D) OVA induced the secretion of IL-6 in IOBA-NHC cells. Statistical data are expressed
  as a mean value ± SD, n = 3. * P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
