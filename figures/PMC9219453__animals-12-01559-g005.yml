caption: 'The proteinâ€“protein interaction network of proteins corresponding to the
  high-PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide)-concentration group.
  Colour indicates proteins take part in retinol binding (blue), adenylate cyclase-modulating
  G protein-coupled receptor signalling pathway (red), complement activation and alternative
  pathway (green). White colour indicates the second shell of interactors. Our input:
  ADCYAP1: pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide; CFB: complement factor
  B; RBP4: retinol-binding protein 4; TF: transferrin.'
