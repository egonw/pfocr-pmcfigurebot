caption: 'RA model mice were induced by collagen antibodies. Lentivirus encapsulated
  AXL overexpression vector (oe-AXL) and negative control vector (oe-NC) were injected
  into the left and right ankle joints. (a) and (b) RT-qPCR and Western blot were
  applied to assess the level of AXL in synovial tissue of joint of RA model mice
  (c-e) The thickness of the rear claw and the clinical inflammation score were evaluated.
  (f) HE staining was used to detect the histopathological changes of knee osteoarthritis.
  Scale: 50 μm. (g) and (h)) Mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia were estimated
  by von Frey microfilament test. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001'
