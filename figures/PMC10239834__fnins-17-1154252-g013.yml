caption: 'Development of speed selectivity in Conv1 layer. Each bar in (A) indicates
  the active channel corresponding to each input class (16 classes = 8 directions × 2
  speeds; test set consists of 240 sequences: 15 initial dot positions × 16 classes;
  labels 1–8 belong to speed-1 inputs and are indicated by blue bars; labels 9–16
  belong to speed-2 inputs and are indicated by green bars). For example, 0° translational
  sequence with speed-1 activates two channels 7 and 34. However, more inputs activate
  channel 34 as indicated by bar length. One can observe that different channels encode
  different motion directions. However, inputs moving in same direction with different
  speeds seems to activate the same channel in bar graph. Speed selectivity in Conv1
  layer using RSMs. (B–I) represent the response similarity matrices (RSMs). The matrix
  entries (15 × 15) indicate the pairwise correlation coefficients for speed-1 and
  speed-2 translational motion sequences whose direction is indicated on top of each
  figure. The diagonal elements of a matrix (as highlighted with red line) represent
  correlation coefficient calculated for the pair of sequences having same initial
  dot configuration and moving with different speeds. Most of the RSMs have no strong
  block diagonal structure (except for 315 and 270°), indicating that different neuronal
  populations in conv1 respond to different speeds. For 315 and 270° block diagonal
  structure can be seen due to the very low correlation values, not because of similar
  responses of conv1 channel to both speeds, as the high correlation value is 0.6
  as indicated in color bar. Thus, even though the same channel codes for a sequence
  with different speeds, within the channel different subpopulations code for different
  speeds.'
