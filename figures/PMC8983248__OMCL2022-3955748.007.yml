caption: DCN promoted autophagy through AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. (a–d) The protein
  levels of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-mTOR, mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p70S6K in ARPE-19 cells. ARPE-19
  cells were treated with 5 mM compound C prior to DCN treatment. The densities of
  p-AMPK/AMPK, p-mTOR/mTOR, and P-p70S6K/p70S6K were analyzed. (e–g) The protein levels
  of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-mTOR, mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p70S6K in ARPE-19 cells. ARPE-19 cells
  were treated with 5 μM MHY1485 prior to DCN treatment. The densities of p-mTOR,
  mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p70S6K were analyzed. (h–k) The protein levels of ATG5, p62,
  and LC3 in ARPE-19 cells. ARPE-19 cells were treated with 5 mM compound C or 5 μM
  MHY1485 prior to DCN treatment under oxidative stress. Data is shown as mean ± SD,
  ∗p < 0.05, and ∗∗p < 0.01.
