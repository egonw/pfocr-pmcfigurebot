figure_title: BMSC-EVs transfer miR-181d to inhibit fibrosis in HK-2 cells
caption: 'A miR-181d expression in HK-2 cells, BMSCs or BMSC-EVs. *p < 0.05 vs. HK-2
  cells. B RT-qPCR analysis of miR-181d expression in renal tissues from patients
  with renal fibrosis (n = 8; two cases at stage I, three cases at stage II, two cases
  at stage III, and one case at stage IV) or healthy controls (n = 12). *p < 0.05
  vs. healthy controls. C Immunofluorescence detection of miR-181d transfer by BMSC-EVs
  into HK-2 cells. *p < 0.05 vs. HK-2 cells. D RT-qPCR analysis of the expression
  of miR-181d in HK-2 cells after co-culture of EVs and BMSCs or those treated with
  GW4869. *p < 0.05 vs. HK-2 cells. #p < 0.05 vs. HK-2 cells co-cultured with BMSCs.
  E RT-qPCR analysis of miR-181d expression in BMSCs in the presence of miR-181d inhibitor.
  *p < 0.05 vs. inhibitor NC. F RT-qPCR analysis of Col4α1, α-SMA, and TGF-βR1 expression
  in HK-2 cells in the presence of miR-181d inhibitor-EVs. *p < 0.05 vs. inhibitor
  NC-EVs. The cell experiment was repeated three independent times.'
