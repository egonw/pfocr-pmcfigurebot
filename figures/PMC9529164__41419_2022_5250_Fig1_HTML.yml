figure_title: The AKT pathway
caption: A A traditional perspective of AKT activation assumes that PI3K, which converts
  PM-associated PIP2 to PIP3 in response to Growth Factors (GF) and other stimuli,
  leads to PIP3-mediated recruitment of cytosolic AKT to PM. The conformational change
  elicited by AKT PH domain binding to PIP3 allows phosphorylation of AKT by PDK1
  and mTORC2. As a result, activated AKT concertedly regulates a great variety of
  targets and functions in the cytosol and the nucleus, among other subcellular compartments.
  B Examples of physiological and pathological processes in which AKT is implicated.
  C Key steps of viral infection regulated by AKT.
