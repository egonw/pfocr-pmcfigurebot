caption: Autophagy markers and ATG12-ATG5 protein expression were affected by different
  concentrations of IL-8. (a) Western blot was used to detect the effects of different
  concentrations of IL-8 on autophagy markers and atG12-ATG5 protein expression. (b)
  Histogram of LC3 ii protein expression. (c) Histogram of Atg5 protein expression.
  (d) Histogram of ATG7 protein expression. (e) Histogram of Beclin1 protein expression.
  (f) Protein expression histogram of ATG12-ATG5 complex. ∗P < 0.05 compared with
  the control group, ∗∗P < 0.001 in contrast to the controls.
