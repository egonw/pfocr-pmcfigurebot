caption: Targeting UCK2 facilitated NK cell surveillance. A Genes related to innate
  immune system were enriched in signalling pathway. B GSEA revealed the relationship
  between signalling pathways and UCK2. C Heatmap showed the expression of genes involved
  in SASP in the indicated cell lines. D WB examined the protein expression of pNFKB,
  NFKB and ICAM1 in the indicated cell lines. E IF detected the expression of ICAM1
  in the indicated cell lines. F CCK8 assays was used to determine the proliferation
  of the indicated cell lines; the cells were incubated with NFKB signalling pathway
  inhibitor BAY11-7082, 7.5 µM. G Correlation between UCK2 and different types of
  NK cell. H Kaplan–Meier curve suggested the combined effect of UCK2 and activated
  NK cell on the prognosis of HCC. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001
article_title: Targeting uridine–cytidine kinase 2 induced cell cycle arrest through
