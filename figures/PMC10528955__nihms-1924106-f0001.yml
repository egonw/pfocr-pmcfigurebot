caption: This illustration depicts the increased peripheral inflammation from adipocytes
  in an overweight or obese state wit h macrophage (M1) AP-1 and NF-kB mediated cellular
  signaling resulting in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the blood
  stream in the background of elevated triglycerides (TG). Within the brain, increased
  ROS and cortisol mediate microglia 1 driven neuroinflammatory changes.
