caption: ABA functional pathway showing the proposed divergence in signaling of stomatal
  closure in different plant lineages. The left branch denotes the ABA pathway in
  fern and lycophyte species, and the right branch denotes the ABA pathway in seed
  plants. The left pathway shows that ABA is involved in spore germination and sex
  determination in ferns and lycophytes (), while ABA regulation of stomatal closure
  is absent owing to the lack of NO synthesis and the ABA-signaling pathway downstream
  of NO. The right pathway indicates that signal transduction for ABA-induced stomatal
  closure has evolved in seed plants (; ; ).
