caption: ICE-CBF-COR signaling pathway plays a vital role in wheat. Cold stress alters
  the fluidity of plasma membrane and activates protein kinases. Furthermore, kinases
  positively regulate cold tolerance in wheat by phosphorylating TaICE proteins, including
  TaICE41, TaICE87. TaICE directly binds to the promoters of TaCBFs to regulate its
  expression. Additionally, TaCBFs bind to the CRT/DRE sequence in the promoters of
  TaCOR genes, such as Wrab15, Wrab17, Wrab18, Wrab19, WCS19, WCS120, Wcor14, and
  Wcor15, for their transcription activation in response to cold stress.
