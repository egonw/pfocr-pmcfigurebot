caption: miR-664a-3p is downregulated in human aortic valve calcification disease
  samples. (a) HE staining of the aortic valve from CAVD and normal clinical samples.
  Scale bar, 400 μm. (b) Western blotting and quantification of BMP2, RUNX2, MST2,
  and OSTERIX protein expression in CAVD and normal clinical samples. GAPDH was used
  for normalization. (c) Volcano plots showing the differential expression of microRNAs
  in the aortic valve from CAVD clinical samples compared to control samples. Pink
  dots indicate significantly upregulated microRNAs in the CAVD group. Green dots
  indicate significantly downregulated microRNAs. Blue dots indicate microRNAs with
  insignificant differences. (d) Heat map shows the clustering analysis results of
  the top 20 microRNAs for differential expression in three pairs of samples. The
  red (higher expression) or green (lower expression) color represents the normalized
  expression value of the indicated microRNAs. (e) The expression levels of four candidate
  microRNAs showing the most significant downregulation in CAVD clinical samples were
  verified by RT-qPCR in five additional pairs of samples. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
