caption: SorCS2 signaling in neuronal networks relevant for AD. SorCS2 is found in
  neural soma, dendrites and axons. Box A) SorCS2 exists in three isoforms that have
  different signaling profiles. SorCS2 is initially produced as a proform, which can
  be cleaved by Furin from its propeptide, giving rise to a single-chain receptor.
  The single-chain can be further cleaved within the leucine-rich domain, producing
  a two-chain isoform. Box B) SorCS2 expression changes upon external stimuli, which
  affects synaptic plasticity. Box C) SorCS2 interactions with neurotrophins. 1. SorCS2
  single-chain binds p75NTR and Trio, which mediates Rac1 and Fascin signaling. Fascin
  activation leads to F-actin filaments assembly and growth cone outgrowth. 2. ProBDNF
  or proNGF binding to SorCS2 leads to dissociation of Trio causing Rac1 signaling
  inactivation, actin filaments disassembly and retraction, and grow cone collapse,
  which is important for synaptic pruning and neuronal wirening. 3. Propeptide of
  BDNF-WT binding to SorCS2 does not affect the growth cone outgrowth. 4. Propeptide
  of BDNF with Val66Met mutation exhibits high binding affinity to SorCS2, subsequently
  dissociating Trio, and inhibiting Rac1 signaling. This pathway promotes elimination
  of spines and loss of synaptic adaptability. 5. SorCS2 two-chain binds p75NTR, which
  mediates proBDNF-dependent apoptosis. Box D) SorCS2 controls synaptic plasticity.
  Upon proBDNF release (1a.), SorCS2 mediates synaptic weakening (4a.) via its interaction
  with proBDNF and p75NTR (2a.), which induces long-term potentiation (LTD; 3a.).
  SorCS2 and the BDNF receptor TrkB are located outside of the postsynaptic density
  (PSD). Upon BDNF release (1b.), SorCS2 and TrkB relocate to the synapse (2b.) where
  they interact. TrkB binds BDNF, and undergoes phosphorylation and activation (3b.),
  subsequently inducing LTP (4b.) and synaptic strengthening (5b.). Box E) SorCS2
  interacts with synaptic receptors GluN2A/2B, EAAT3, and TrkB at PSD of glutamergic
  neurons, and regulates their anterograde and retrograde trafficking. Impairments
  in these processes lead to increased cellular stress and neurodegeneration
