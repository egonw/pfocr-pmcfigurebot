caption: A model for OsSPL response to temperature change and involvement in the regulation
  of rice fertility. Under low temperature conditions, the miR156-OsSPL module regulated
  CHI expression in response to temperature changes, resulting in a strong synthesis
  of flavonols and flavones in the flavonoid pathway, providing sufficient flavonoid
  substances for the formation of fertile pollen. In addition, the miR156-OsSPL module
  regulates APX1 gene expression and controls the PCD process in the tapetum by affecting
  the APX-ROS balance, providing the material basis for the formation of fertile pollen.
