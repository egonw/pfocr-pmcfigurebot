figure_title: ADT-OH inhibits melanoma cells invasion in vitro
caption: a–c Summary of results from the transwell invasion assay. After 12 h of incubation
  with different concentrations of ADT-OH (0, 6.3, 25, 100 μM), the cells that migrated
  to the lower chamber were fixed, stained, and counted using a light microscope.
  Four random fields per filter were scanned for the presence of cells on the lower
  side of the membrane. The panels of the upper figures show the images obtained by
  cell invasion assay in B16F10, B16F1 and A375 cells. All experiments were performed
  thrice in triplicate. The data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.005 compared with vehicle group. d–f Representative images of F-actin immunofluorescence
  in B16F10, B16F1 and A375 cells. The cells were treated under the same experimental
  conditions as (a–c). Scale bars correspond to 20 μm.
