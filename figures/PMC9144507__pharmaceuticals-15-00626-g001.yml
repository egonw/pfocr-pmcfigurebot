  of the LKB1/AMPK pathway in hepatocytes and adipocytes, and in the pancreas, leads
  to reduced blood glucose and insulin availability, respectively. Decreased glucose
  and insulin availability can slow tumor growth and progression. LKB1: Liver Kinase
  B1, AMPK: AMP-Activated Protein Kinase. Created in BioRender.'
