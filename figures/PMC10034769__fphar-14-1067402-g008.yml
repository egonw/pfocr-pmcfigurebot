caption: 'Urolithin A (UA) inhibited ferroptosis by activating Nrf2. (A) Typical TEM
  images showed ferroptosis in the lung tissues. (B–D) TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 concentrations
  in the supernatants BEAS-2B cells. (E,F) SOD and MDA activities in lung tissues.
  (G) Fe2+ expression in BEAS-2B cells. The results were represented by mean ± SD.
  ## p < 0.01, ** p < 0.01, &&p < 0.01 in comparison to control, LPS and LPS + UA
  groups, respectively.'
article_title: Urolithin A (UA) attenuates ferroptosis in LPS-induced acute lung injury
  in mice by upregulating Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.
