caption: 'Western blotting was used to analyze the protein expression levels of RUNX2,
  β-catenin, p-GSK-3β, and GSK-3β of BMSCs cocultured with or without 0.1 μg/mL GOQDs
  and DKK1 (an inhibitor of β-catenin). (A) Expression levels of related proteins
  tested by western blotting and (B-E) quantitative analysis of protein expression
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, compared with 0.1 μg/mL GOQDs; #p < 0.05,
  ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001, compared with control).'
