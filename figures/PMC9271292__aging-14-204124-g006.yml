caption: Pathway activity analysis of necroptosis-related regulators. (A) Gene-pathway
  network showed the regulatory relationship between necroptosis-related regulators
  and cancer pathways in pan-cancer. Different colors represent different cancer types.
  (B) The heatmap showed the percentage of cancer types in which the specific necroptosis-related
  regulator has an effect (FDR â‰¤ 0.05) on the specific pathway in pan-cancer.
