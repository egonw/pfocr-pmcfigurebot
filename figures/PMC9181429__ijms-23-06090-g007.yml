caption: Effects of sialidase-3 inhibition on activation of the RISK pathway. Activation
  of Akt and Erk1/2 in OX-Neu3 H9c2 treated with LR332 (arbitrary name given to the
  non-commercially available sialidase3 inhibitor synthesized by our group) was examined
  by WB. (A) WB analysis of phospho-Akt (Thr308) and total-Akt (upper panel); ratio
  between phospho-Akt (Thr308) and total-Akt (lower panel); (B) WB analysis of phospho-Erk1/2
  (Thr202/Tyr204) and total-Erk1/2 (upper panel); ratio between phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204)
  and total-Erk1/2 (lower panel). Data are expressed as relative amounts compared
  with LR332 untreated OX-Neu3 cells exposed to IRI in vitro (CTRL dashed line). Each
  square in the graphs represent an experimental replicate. Statistical significance
  was determined by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.
