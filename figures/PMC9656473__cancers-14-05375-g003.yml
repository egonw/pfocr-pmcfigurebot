caption: Differential methylation analysis. Differential methylation analysis revealed
  12,597 DMCGs (a). Thereby, PD-L1 high-expressing glioblastomas showed global hypomethylation
  compared with PD-L1 low-expressing glioblastomas (b). Allocating DMCGs on genomic
  positions revealed more than 80% being located in tiling regions while less than
  10% are in promoter, gene and CpG island regions (c). For GO enrichment analysis,
  top 500 ranked regions (indicated in red) were processed (d). Word clouds show GO
  term enrichments of “DNA replication-dependent nucleosome assembly”, “chromatin
  silencing at rDNA”, and “DNA packaging” in hypermethylated gene regions, and (e)
  “G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway” in hypomethylated gene regions (f).
