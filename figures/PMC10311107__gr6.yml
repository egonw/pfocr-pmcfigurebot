caption: Alkaloid biosynthesis in the stems of Dendrobium nobile. Red letters represent
  up-regulated expression (FDR were < 0.5 and fold change were ≥ 1.5), green letters
  represent down-regulated expression (FDR were < 0.5 and fold change were ≤ -1.5),
  and black letters represent no significant change in metabolite accumulation or
  gene expression. The orange box and letters indicate a pathway. Heatmaps show the
  level of increase and decrease of enzyme gene expression. Color scale on the top
  left represented normalized values of FPKM values and six boxes of each enzyme gene
  represented three biological replicates of DnS1 and DnS2, respectively. Dashed arrows
  indicate unverified steps in the pathway. HMGCS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase;
