caption: Effect of magnoflorine on infarct volume, brain water content, and neurological
  function following cerebral ischemia in rats. The representative images of TTC staining
  of brain sections (a) and quantification of the infarct volume (b) were shown. Brain
  water content (c), mNSS score (d), and longa behavior test score (e) were measured
  after cerebral ischemia. Values are mean ± SEM, n = 6 per group. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001. MNF, magnoflorine; BBR, berberine; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion.
