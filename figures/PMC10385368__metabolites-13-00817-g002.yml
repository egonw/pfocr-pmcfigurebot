caption: MTT Cell Viability. Cell viability is calculated from absorbance and presented
  as percentage compared to 0 mM sucralose/No additional treatment group. Two-way
  ANOVA sucralose-treated groups, F(6,96) = 2.4378, p = 0.0308; post HOC test Tukey
  HSD with p-value set at p < 0.05. Groups bearing the same letter above the graph
  are not statistically different.
