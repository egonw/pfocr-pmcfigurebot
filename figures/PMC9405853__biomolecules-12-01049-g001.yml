caption: Selenocysteine gene module in the co-essentiality network. (a) 2D map of
  the genome-wide co-essentiality network showing the location of selenoproteins and
  Sec machinery proteins. Other proteins clustered with individual selenoproteins
  are highlighted by different colors. (b) Co-essentiality network with an expanded
  view showing tight clustering of 11 proteins (shown in red) in the Sec cluster.
  (c) Pathway enrichment analysis of proteins in the Sec cluster. (d) Correlation
  heatmap of cell viability scores between 11 proteins in the Sec cluster. Values
  correspond to Pearsonâ€™s correlation across 941 cancer cell lines from the Cancer
  Dependency Map []. (e) Interaction network based on experimental evidence and text
  mining from STRING database [] showing a functional connection between PRDX6 and
  GPX4. (f) Correlation heatmap of cell viability scores between all proteins in the
  Sec cluster and the rest of selenoproteins. The top left corner corresponds to the
  same proteins as in panel (d). A larger version of the heatmap including protein
  names is provided as .
