caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of intersected DEGs. The sizes of the circles
  present the gene number enriched in each pathway. Bigger size presents more enriched
  genes and red presents lower P value. The DEGs were principally enriched in the
  focal adhesion, drug metabolismâ€”cytochrome P450, chemical carcinogenesis, glutathione
  metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 pathway. KEGG, Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; DEGs, differentially expressed genes.
