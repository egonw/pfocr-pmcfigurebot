caption: Correlation between TRPC score and response to NCRT in the GSE45404 cohort.
  The scatter diagram of the TRPC score between response and non-response group (A),
  and fourfold table between TRPC score and NCRT response (B). (C) ROC curve of TRPC
  score to predict NCRT response. (D) The distribution of the TRPC activity between
  response and non-response group. (E) Scatter plot showed the association between
  the TRPC activity and TRPC score. (F) Heat map of correlation between the TRPC activity
  and immune infiltration. (G) ssGSEA scores of immune cells and immune-related functions
  between response and non-response group. (H-J) Scatter plot showed the association
  between immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4) and the TRPC activity.
  (K-M) Scatter plot showed the association between signaling pathway (e.g., mismatch
  repair, MAPK signaling pathway, and B cell receptor signaling pathway) and the TRPC
  activity. NCRT, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; ROC, receiver operator characteristic;
  ssGSEA, single sample gene set enrichment analysis; TRPC, transient receptor potential
  channels; ns, not significant; *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01.
