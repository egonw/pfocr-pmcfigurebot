figure_title: Elevated activity of Hif-1 signaling pathway in CKO growth plate chondrocytes
caption: 'A Volcano plot of RNA-seq. B mRNA expression level of significantly downregulated
  genes (Matn1, Comp, Pycr1, Angptl6, Cnmd, and Ucma) in E18.5 CKO growth plate cartilage
  compared to WT. n = 3 biological replicates. C, D GO enrichment analysis (C) and
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (D) of up- and down-regulated genes (Log2FC > 1
  or < -1, p-value < 0.05) according to RNA-seq results. Red boxes: items we focus
  on. E The expression of Hif1α of tibia of E18.5 WT and CKO embryos (left panel),
  and protein level of Hif1α (right panel, top) and the luciferase activity (right
  panel, bottom) of Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre under
  normoxic or hypoxic conditions. n = 4 biological replicates. Scale bar: 100 μm.
  F Hnrnpk protein level of supernatant immunoprecipitated with antibodies of Hnrnpk
  or IgG. G, H RIP-PCR (G) and RIP-qPCR (H) were used to determine the level of binding
  between Hnrnpk and Hif1a mRNA. IgG IP was used as a specificity control. n = 3 biological
  replicates. I Half-life of Hif1a mRNA of Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes infected with
  Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre. n = 3 biological replicates. J Protein level of Sox9, Mmp13, p21,
  and Hnrnpk of Hnrnpkfl/fl chondrocytes infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre under normoxic
  or hypoxic conditions. K Protein level of Hif1α, Sox9, and Mmp13 in Hnrnpkfl/fl
  chondrocytes treated with DMSO or Chetomin after being infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre
  under hypoxic condition. p-value was calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons tests (E) or two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (B, H, I).
  Data were shown as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.'
