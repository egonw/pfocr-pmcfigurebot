caption: Glutamine promotes CA19-9 biosynthesis in vitro. A, B The addition of 2 mM
  glutamine to glutamine-free medium increased the expression of CA19-9 in SW1990,
  BxPC-3, and SU.8686 cells, as observed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy.
  Cells were cultured in different media for 72 h. Quantification is shown to the
  right. Data were randomly chosen in seven different fields. Scale bars, 25 μm. C
  The expression of CA19-9 in cells cultured for 72 h in glutamine-free medium, 2 mM
  glutamine medium, and 2 mM glutamine medium treated with 50 µM Don or 10 µM Aza
  was examined by Western blot. D The expression of CA19-9 in pancreatic cancer cells
  cultured in glutamine-free medium or 2 mM glutamine medium for 24 or 48 h was examined
  by western blot. E The concentration of CA19-9 in the supernatants of cells cultured
  for 72 h in glutamine-free medium, 2 mM glutamine medium, and 2 mM glutamine medium
  treated with 50 µM Don or 10 µM Aza was examined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.
  Three replicates per condition. All data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. Three
  replicates per condition. Don diazooxonorleucine, Aza azaserine, UHPLC-MS ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass
  spectrometer. Data represent the mean ± s.e.m. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001;
  ****p < 0.0001. ns not significant
