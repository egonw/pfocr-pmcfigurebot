caption: 'Adropin is expressed at low levels in calcific vascular tissues and osteogenic
  differentiated VSMCs. (a, b) The protein expression of adropin in rat vascular tissues
  and VSMCs was quantified using western blotting. GAPDH was used as the loading control.
  (c) The mRNA expression levels of adropin in VSMCs were quantified using reverse-transcription
  quantitative PCR. GAPDH was used as the loading control. (d, e) The expression of
  adropin in VSMCs was evaluated using immunofluorescence. Each experiment was performed
  three times, and data are presented as the mean ± SD. VSMCs: vascular smooth muscle
  cells. #p <0.05 compared to vehicle.'
