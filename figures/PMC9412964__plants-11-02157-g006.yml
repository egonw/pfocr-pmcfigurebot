caption: Changes in the amino acid levels in WT and atg5 Physcomitrella cells following
  their transfer from BCDAT to BCDATG medium. WT and atg5 mutant Physcomitrella cells
  grown on BCDAT agar medium were transferred to BCDATG liquid medium and grown under
  light conditions. (A) Amino acids were extracted from WT and atg5 cells immediately
  (0 d) and 1 d after transfer and measured. (B) Among the 15 amino acids detected
  and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the 6 amino acids with significantly different levels
  in WT and atg5 cells immediately (0 d) and 1 d after transfer are presented. (C)
  Total amino acid levels i.e., the summation of the 16 amino acid levels immediately
  (0 d) and 1 d after transfer in WT and atg5 cells are shown. (A–C) Data are shown
  as means ± SD (n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005).
