caption: K‐ras signaling pathway is upregulated and unfolded protein response pathway
  is downregulated in high‐CIN cells in 3D culture compared with 2D culture. (A) Downregulated
  and upregulated pathways in high‐CIN cells in 3D culture. Gene hallmarks with adjusted
  p < 0.05 are shown. (B) GSEA of genes categorized as K‐ras signaling up (left) and
  unfolded protein response (right) between high‐CIN cells in 2D and 3D culture. (C–F)
  Sensitivity of low‐CIN and high‐CIN cells in 2D and 3D culture to a Raf inhibitor
  (C), a MEK inhibitor I (D), tunicamycin (E), and toyocamycin (F). Viability of low‐CIN
  and high‐CIN HeLa cell clones as well as the parental cells was measured by MTT
  assay at indicated drug concentrations. p values were obtained using the Dunnett's
  multiple comparisons test. *p < 0.05 comparing High‐CIN to Parental. †p < 0.05 comparing
  Low‐CIN and Parental
