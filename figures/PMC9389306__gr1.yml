caption: Hypoxia and STOX1 overexpression affect the fumarate-dependentl-malate pathway.
  (A) Characteristics of control, STOX1A and STOX1B over-expressing human trophoblast
  cell lines, and experimental plan in the presence and in the absence of the hypoxia-mimetic
  agent CoCl2. (B) Immunoblot of the hypoxia marker HIF1A and the internal reference
  GAPDH from whole-cell extracts. The immunoblot is representative of 3 independent
  experiments. (C) Schematic representation of the Krebs cycle where the reaction
  catalyzed by the enzyme fumarase from fumarate (substrate) to l-malate (product)
  is framed. Levels of the (D) fumarate and (E)l-malate metabolites expressed in nmol/mg
  of protein. (F) Fumarase specific activity (fumarase activity/fumarase protein content)
  expressed as percent of untreated control BD3 cell line. Dosages (fumarate, malate)
  and enzyme activity (fumarase), n = 3 independent experiments, mean ± SD. *p ≤ 0.05
  **p ≤ 0.01 ***p ≤ 0.001 based on one-way ANOVA versus the untreated control (red
  stars) or the corresponding untreated condition (blue stars). (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
