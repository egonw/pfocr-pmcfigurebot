caption: TRIM22 knockdown attenuates the migratory and invasive capacities of RA-FLSs.
  The (A) migration and (B) invasion of RA-FLSs were assessed via Transwell assays.
  Magnification, ×200. (C) Western blotting was performed to analyze the protein expression
  levels of MMP2 and MMP9. ***P<0.001 vs. si-NC. TRIM22, tripartite motif-containing
  22; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; FLS, fibroblast-like synoviocyte; si, small interfering
  RNA; NC, negative control.
article_title: FOXC1-mediated TRIM22 regulates the excessive proliferation and inflammation
  of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis via NF-κB signaling pathway.
