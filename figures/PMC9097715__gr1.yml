caption: Her2 transformed cells showed upregulation of UPR genes in response to JG98Transformation
  with Her2 oncogene enhances the sensitivity of the MCF10A cells to JG-98 treatment.
  Transcriptome analysis was performed with untransformed and transformed MCF10A cells
  treated with 1 μM JG-98 treatment for 12 h or left untreated.(A) GSEA analysis of
  RNAseq data shows significant upregulation of UPR pathway following JG-98 treatment.(B)
  Hallmark genes of unfolded protein response are significantly enriched in transformed
  cells in response to JG-98 treatment compared to untransformed cells. Color key
  represents the raw Z score. The experiments were performed in biological duplicates
  (n = 2).(C) Sensitivity of transformed and untransformed cells to JG-98. MCF10A
  or Her2-transformed MCF10A cells were treated with 1 μM JG-98 for 24 h at 50% confluency
  or left untreated. Cell viability was counted by number of DAPI stained cells using
  Hermes Imaging systems (representative images shown). Experiment was performed in
  biological replicates (n = 3) and high throughput analysis was done using 31 images
  from each well using in-built Athena software package.(D) Scatterplot showing the
  relative percentage of cells survival after 24 h of JG-98 treatment with means ±
  SEM (Quantification of data shown in (C)). Statistical analysis was performed using
  two-way ANOVA.(E) Efficiency of CHOP (DDIT3) depletion following siRNA treatment.
  Levels of CHOP mRNA were quantified by qPCR, experiment was performed in biological
  replicates (n = 3), scatterplot showing the relative mRNA depletion represented
  as means ± SEM, statistics was performed using unpaired Welch’s correction, two-tailed
  t-test.(F) CHOP depletion reduces cell death in response to JG-98. Cells were transfected
  with siControl or siCHOP, followed by 1μM of JG-98 treatment for 24 h or left untreated.
  Cell viability was counted by number of DAPI stained cells using Hermes Imaging
  systems and representative images shown, experiment was performed in biological
  replicates (n = 3) and analysis was done using 126 images from each well.(G) Scatterplot
  showing relative percentage of cells survival after 24 h of JG-98 treatment plotted
  as means ± SEM (Quantification of data shown in (F)), Statistical analysis was performed
  using two-way ANOVA. All statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad (v9),
  level of significance was taken as (∗p < 0.0332, ∗∗p < 0.0021, ∗∗∗p < 0.0002). See
