caption: (A) Western Blot analyses of phospho- and total AKT performed on cells cultured
  in basal condition and with HGF, U0126, U0126 + HGF for 15 min. Densitometric analyses
  of the bands are reported (B) (* vs. CTRL p < 0.01). Results were expressed in fold
  change, with the control considered as 1 (Â±standard error of the mean (S.E.M.)).
  Three independent experiments were performed.
