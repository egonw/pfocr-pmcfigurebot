caption: Mechanical loading activated Piezo1 and Ca2+ influx induces the opening of
  Cx43 HCs. A, B, and C EtBr dye uptake of MLO-Y4 cells pre-incubated with BAPTA,
  followed by fluid dropping (A), FFSS (B), and Yoda1 (C) treatment. D, E, and F)
  EtBr dye uptake level in MLO-Y4 cells pre-incubated with Cx43(E2) antibody, Dooku1,
  apyrase or BAPTA, at basal level (D) or followed by treatment with Yoda1 (E) or
  ionomycin (F); Data are shown as mean ± SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
  Statistical analysis was performed using One-way ANOVA for multiple comparison analysis
