figure_title: Auto-sumoylation of Ubc9 is required for the regulation of sumoylation
  of factors involved in translation and energy metabolism
caption: 'a, Pie chart showing the distribution of SUMO-modified proteins in only
  wild-type (WT; magenta) and in both WT and ubc9-RR (green). SUMO-modified proteins
  were identified via mass spectrometry, as shown in . b,c, KEGG analysis of SUMO-modified
  proteins in only WT (b) and in both WT and ubc9-RR(c) displayed in a, as shown in
  . Numbers indicate the number of proteins identified in each pathway. d,e, Schematic
  diagram showing the list of Ubc9 auto-sumoylation-governed targets in the translation
  (d) and energy metabolism (e) pathways. Proteins in the two pathways depicted in
  b and care marked as red and blue colors, respectively. Solid and dashed arrows
  denote the direction of fluxes and pathways in which intermediate molecules are
  not depicted, respectively. Metabolites in metabolic reactions are represented as
  yellow hexagons. The pie graph within d shows the distribution of SUMO targets among
  ribosomal subunits and are classified by the indicated groups. PPP: pentose phosphate
  pathway; DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PDH complex: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  Ac-CoA: Acetyl-CoA; OAA: oxaloacetate; ETC: electron transport chain.'
