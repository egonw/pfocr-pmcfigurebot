caption: Histopathological structures of the lung. a H&E stained lung sections from
  the Vehicle, LoNP, MiNP, and HiNP-treated groups were observed at 200 × magnification
  using an optical microscope. b Histopathological parameters analyses. Two independents
  scored the degree of histopathological changes in the lung tissue in a double-blind
  screen, as described in materials and methods. PA, average vessel wall thickness,
  and NS in the lung sections were analysed using the Image J program. Four to six
  mice per group were used to prepare the H&E stained slides, and the histopathological
  parameters were measured in duplicate for each slide. c mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic
  marker genes. The transcript levels of TGF-β1, pro-collagen I, fibronectin, and
  CTGF gene were measured in the total mRNA of the lung tissue by RT-qPCR using the
  specific primers. The mRNA levels of the six genes were calculated based on the
  intensity of β-actin as an endogenous control. Four to six mice per group were used
  to prepare the total RNA; RT-qPCR analyses were assayed in duplicate for each sample.
  d Regulation of the TGF-β1 signalling pathway. Expression levels of TGF-β1, Smad2/3,
  and β-catenin were measured by Western blot analysis using the specific primary
  antibodies and HRP-labelled anti-rabbit IgG antibody. After the intensity of each
  band was determined using an imaging densitometer, the relative levels of the four
  proteins were calculated based on the intensity of actin. Four to six mice per group
  were used to prepare the total tissue homogenate, and western blot analyses were
  assayed in duplicate for each sample. The data was reported as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05
  compared to the Vehicle-inhaled group. LoNP low concentration of nanoplastics, MiNP
  medium concentration of nanoplastics, HiNP high concentration of nanoplastics, BR
  bronchioles, PA pulmonary parenchymal area, NS number of alveolar septal, CTGF connective
