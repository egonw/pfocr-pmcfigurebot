caption: Asymmetric SPB binding of OpBfa1 in the cell cycle. (a) Cell cycle dependent
  localisation of OpBfa1-GFP. OpBFA1-GFP MPS3-mRFP cells (HPH1761) were grown in YPDS
  medium at 30 °C. Mps3-mRFP is a marker for the SPB. Shown are deconvolved and projected
  GFP and RFP images and merged brightfield, GFP, and RFP images. Scale bar, 2 µm.
  Yellow M and D mark the mother and daughter cell compartments of a large budded
  cell, respectively. Asterisks indicate a weak GFP signal at the mSPB. (b) Quantification
  of cells in a. Cells were categorised based on budding and the number and position
  of the SPB. GFP signals were judged as no, weak, or strong signals. N > 200 cells.
  In quantification of G2/Metaphase cells, the SPB locating at the position closest
  to the bud was designated as dSPB and the other SPB as mSPB. (c) Time-lapse microscopy
  of OpBFA1-GFP MPS3-mRFP cells (HPH1761). Images were taken every 1 min. Only GFP
  signal was captured. Yellow asterisks indicate metaphase SPBs at the start of the
  time series. The cell entered into anaphase between the 10 min and 11 min timepoints.
  Scale bar, 2 µm.
