caption: Antifungal activity of differentially changed metabolites in flavonoids pathway.
  (A) Mycelial plugs of the B05.10 was inoculated on PDA medium with different compounds
  including kaempferol, quercetin, hesperetin and luteolin. The growth of the fungi
  was observed and photographed at 48 h. (B) The colony diameter was determined at
  24 h and 48 h, respectively. Asterisks indicate significant differences between
  untreated (CK) and flavonoids treated (∗, P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test). (C) The
  relative inhibition rates of different flavonoids towards B05.10 were determined
  at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. All data represent means ± SD from at least three
  independent experiments.
