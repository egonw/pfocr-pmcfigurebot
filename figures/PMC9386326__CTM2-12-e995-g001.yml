caption: GSTZ1 deficiency with UGDH up‐regulation promotes hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) metastasis. (A) Western blotting for UGDH, pSmad2/3, GSTZ1 and E‐cadherin
  in tumour tissues from HCC patients with metastatic recurrence and adjacent non‐tumoural
  tissues. (B) Representative Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of GSTZ1 and UGDH
  in HCC tissue microarray. Scores (ranging 0–3) were calculated by intensity and
  percentage of stained cells. Scale bar, 200 μm. (C) Percentage of metastatic or
  non‐metastatic recurrence of HCC patients (n = 58 samples), stratified by GSTZ1
  and UGDH expression. Specifically, HCC patients were classified into low (scores
  of 5–92, 41 cases) versus high (scores of 93–159, 17 cases) GSTZ1 expression and
  low (scores of 89–138, 41 cases) versus high (scores of 139–162, 17 cases) UGDH
  expression subgroups. (D and E) Staining scores of GSTZ1 and UGDH in tumour tissues
  from HCC patients with metastatic recurrence (n = 21) and without metastatic recurrence
  (n = 37). (F) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of overall survival rate for HCC patients
  in GSTZ1 low subgroup stratified by UGDH expression, using tissue microarray cohort.
  (G) Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of overall survival rate for patients with HCC
  from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)‐liver hepatocellular carcinoma dataset (n = 365),
  stratified by GSTZ1 and UGDH expression. (H) UDP‐GlcUA levels in tumour tissues
  from HCC patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 18) metastatic recurrence. (I) UDP‐GlcUA
  levels in serum samples from HCC patients with (n = 36) or without (n = 34) metastatic
  recurrence. Data are mean ± SD. p‐Values were derived from a chi‐square test in
  (C); an unpaired, two‐tailed Student's t‐test in (D and E); a two‐sided log‐rank
  test in (F–G), and Mann–Whitney U test in (H and I). (*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p
  < .001).
