figure_title: Nucleotide identity opposite the AP site does not effect NEIL3-dependent
  ICL unhooking or TLS
caption: a, Model of two alternative mechanisms of AP site bypass. Translesion synthesis
  (left branch) uses a specialized TLS polymerase for untemplated insertion of a nucleotide
  opposite the non-coding AP site. In this pathway, the nucleotide opposite the AP
  site in the parental plasmid does not influence insertion by the TLS polymerase.
  Template switching (right branch) uses the newly synthesized DNA of the other sister
  chromatid as a template for error-free bypass of the AP site. In this case, the
  inserted nucleotide is expected to co-vary with the nucleotide opposite the AP site
  in the parental plasmid.b, Plasmid design for next generation sequencing. We prepared
  four different plasmids, each containing an AP-ICL and a different nucleotide positioned
  opposite the AP site (Y), as well as a unique barcode (X-Y). An Nt.BstNBI restriction
  site allows specific cleavage of the AP site-containing strand to prevent its amplification
  during PCR. A dC-dC mismatch allows reads produced from amplification of the nascent
  strand that has bypassed the AP site (PCR product in orange box) to be distinguished
  from reads derived from the corresponding parental strand (upper PCR product).c,
  The four AP-ICL plasmids, each containing a different nucleotide opposite the AP-site
  (described in b), were replicated in undepleted egg extract supplemented with [α−32P]dATP.
  Replication intermediates were analyzed as in . The base opposite the AP site had
  no apparent effect on replication or repair efficiency.d, HMCES immunodepletion.
  The extracts used to generate the sequencing libraries described in  were blotted
  for HMCES. Asterisk, non-specific band.e, The four AP-ICL plasmids described in
  b were pooled and replicated with [α−32P]dATP in the same extracts (shown in panel
  d) and used to generate sequencing libraries described in . Replication intermediates
  were analyzed as in .f, Analysis of PCR amplicons used for sequencing. In parallel
  to the reactions shown in e, pooled pICLAP plasmids were replicated in the indicated
  extracts (shown in d, but lacking [α−32P]dATP) supplemented with rHMCES, as indicated.
  DNA was extracted and digested with Nt.BstNBI (to cleave AP site-containing strands).
  The region of the replicated plasmids surrounding the ICL was then amplified by
  PCR. PCR amplicons were resolved by native agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized
  by Sybr Gold staining.g, Analysis of sequencing reads derived from individual pICLAP
  plasmids. The barcode was used to distinguish sequencing reads derived from the
  four different AP-ICL containing plasmids described in b. For each extract condition,
  we obtained >30,000 mapped reads, the vast majority (87.4%−87.8%) of which either
  perfectly matched the reference sequence or had a single point mutation corresponding
  to the position opposite the AP site. Of these reads, >11,000 in each condition
  derived from the nascent DNA stand produced upon bypass of the AP site. The fraction
  of reads corresponding to insertion of a given nucleotide opposite the AP site are
  plotted for each plasmid and extract condition. n, number of pooled nascent strand
  reads obtained for each condition. The result shows that the nucleotide opposite
  the AP site in the parental plasmid template does not influence the distribution
  of nascent DNA nucleotides inserted opposite the AP site after unhooking. Next generation
  sequencing read counts can be found in .
