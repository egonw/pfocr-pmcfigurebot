caption: Inhibition of HMGA1 and the downstream pathway of miR-4730 expression. (A)
  Correlation between HMGA1 and miR-4730 expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  tumor samples. Patients without HMGA1 expression (n=7) were excluded. HMGA1 and
  miR-4730 expression negatively correlated (P=0.031 and P=−0.272, analyzed using
  Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). (B) The alterations of HMGA1 and downstream
  ILK/Akt/GSK3β pathway following miR-4730 overexpression were examined using western
  blot analysis. The expression of downstream pathway-related proteins was inhibited
  in liver cancer cell lines. Experiments were performed in triplicate and results
  are shown as the mean ± SD. an unpaired t-test was used to analyze the data (**P<0.01,
  vs. mock group). (C) Diagram of miR-4730 inhibiting HMGA1 and the ILK/Akt/GSK3β
  signaling pathway. HMGA1, high mobility group A1; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; GSK3β,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β.
