caption: 'MiRNA expression in HCEpiCs in response to rhNGF. Volcano plots from human
  microRNA array cards Set (A) (top) and Set (B) (bottom) analysis, representing levels
  of miRNAs with respect to unstimulated cells (CTRL) (A) and, dynamically, through
  experimental time points (B). Significant miRNAs IDs are reported close to the corresponding
  plot. x axis: fold change (RQ, relative quantification, log scale); y axis: p-value
  (log scale). Horizontal blue line: p = 0.05 threshold. Between brackets: miRs not
  currently listed in the MiRbase database.'
