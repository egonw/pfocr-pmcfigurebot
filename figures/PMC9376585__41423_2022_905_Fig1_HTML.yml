caption: Basic mechanisms of canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes. The mechanisms
  of pyroptosis are divided into canonical pathways activated by caspase-1 and noncanonical
  pathways activated by caspase-11/4/5. Activated caspase-1/11 can induce the formation
  of GSDMD-NT, which contributes to the perforation of the cell membrane and enhances
  the capability of processing IL-1β and IL-18. Canonical inflammasomes, including
  NLRP3, AIM2, NLRP1, PYRIN, and NLRC4 inflammasomes, are usually composed of PRR,
  ASC, and pro-caspase-1. NLRP3 is triggered by endogenous danger signals, such as
  pore-forming toxins, crystalline structures, extracellular ATP, and RNA. NLRP1 is
  mainly activated by physiologically relevant factors, including the lethal toxin
  found in anthrax and muramyl dipeptide. NLRC4 typically responds to bacterial flagellin
  and PrgJ, which are rod and needle proteins. AIM2 directly binds to cytosolic dsDNA
  from DNA viruses to activate them. Pyrin activation is caused by exposure to pathogenic
  toxins. The noncanonical pyroptosis pathway is directly triggered by LPS from extracellular
  Gram‐negative bacteria
