caption: Knockdown of DIO3OS inhibited cellular migration, invasion of osteosarcoma
  cells in vitro. A Expression level of DIO3OS in osteosarcoma cell lines and healthy
  cell line detected by qRT-PCR. B The location of DIO3OS in SaoS-2 cell line was
  determined by qRT-PCR of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fraction isolations. C DIO3OS
  expression was inhibited in SaoS-2 cells after si-DIO3OS transfection. D DIO3OS
  expression was inhibited in U2OS cells after si-DIO3OS transfection. E Cell migration
  and invasion was inhibited in SaoS-2 cells transfected with si-DIO3OS. The scale
  bar were marked in red, 100 μm. F Cell migration and invasion was inhibited in U2OS
  cells transfected with si-DIO3OS. The scale bar were marked in red, 100 μm. G The
  expression levels of E-cad protein were increasd and Vimentin protein expression
  were inhibited in SaoS-2 cells after si-DIO3OS transfection. H The expression levels
  of E-cad were up-regulated and Vimentin protein were inhibited in U2OS cells after
  si-DIO3OS transfection. I DIO3OS knockdown suppressed cell migration capacity in
  SaoS-2 cells, as determined by wound healing assay. J DIO3OS knockdown suppressed
  cell migration capacity in U2OS cells, as determined by wound-healing assay. P-value
  of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant (ns, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05;
  **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001)
