caption: Analysis of genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis in the intersection
  genes between the 825 continually DEGs and the turquoise and brown modules. A Anthocyanin
  biosynthesis pathway. The red font indicates the genes obtained in the intersection
  genes. B Heatmap of the expression levels of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. C qRT-PCR detection of anthocyanin biosynthesis
  related structural genes, CHI (Cs7g29780), F3H (Cs1g25280 and Cs2g04110), F3’H (Cs5g11730)
  and GST (Cs6g15900). D Correlation analysis of the expression profiles in qRT-PCR
  (qPCR) and transcriptome data (FPKM) (*, ** and *** represent significant differences
  at p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively between the two sets of data)
article_title: Weighted gene coexpression correlation network analysis reveals the
  potential molecular regulatory mechanism of citrate and anthocyanin accumulation
  between postharvest ‘Bingtangcheng’ and ‘Tarocco’ blood orange fruit.
