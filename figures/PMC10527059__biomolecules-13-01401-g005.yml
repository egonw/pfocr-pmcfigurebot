caption: Cellular pathways and PPI for proteins that interact directly with circPSEN1s.
  (A) Analysis of proteins interacting with circPSEN1s revealed six significant cellular
  pathways (p < 0.05). These pathways are adherens junction, long-term potentiation,
  longevity regulating, lysine degradation, Notch signaling, and TGF-β (transforming
  growth factor β) signaling. The size axis indicates the number of genes significantly
  associated with each pathway. As depicted, EP300 (E1A binding protein p300) is the
  only gene present in four signaling pathways. (B) The protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) network constructed for the proteins interacting with circPSEN1s showed that
  FOXA1 (forkhead box A1) and EP300 exhibited the highest degree, indicating a greater
  interaction with other proteins in the network. The high degree of interaction suggests
  that FOXA1 and EP300 may play important roles in mediating the functions of circPSEN1s
  and their associated pathways. (C) Gene ontology analysis was performed to investigate
  the functional characteristics of proteins interacting with circPSEN1s.
