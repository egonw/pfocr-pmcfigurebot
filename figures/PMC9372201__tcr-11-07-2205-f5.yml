caption: 'GLIPR1 increased cell migration of SHC-44 and SW1783 cells by verified transwell
  assay, and cells were stained with crystal violet. (A) Overexpression or interference
  with GLIPR1 further increased the invasion of SHC-44 cells. (B) Overexpression or
  interference with GLIPR1 further increased the invasion of SW1783 cells. Magnification:
  ×200, scale bar: 100 µm. (*) represents a significance compared with the Model group.
  ****, P<0.0001. NC, normal group; Model, model group.'
article_title: GLIPR1 regulates the TIMP1-CD63-ITGB1-AKT signaling pathway in glioma
  cells and induces malignant transformation of astroglioma.
