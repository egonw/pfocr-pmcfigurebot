caption: 'Downregulation of FGFR1 affected the apoptosis of sorafenib-resistant HCC
  cells. (a) Cell viability of THLE-2, HepG2, and HUH-7 after treatment with indicated
  concentration of sorafenib was assessed by CCK8 assay, and half-maximal inhibitory
  concentration (IC50) was calculated with a linear fit. (b) Sorafenib-resistant HUH-7
  cell line (HUH-7/R) was constructed, and the cell viability was assessed to define
  the resistance index (RI) of the HUH-7/R cell line. (c) Western blotting analysis
  of multidrug resistance marker of P-gp and MRP1 was detected. (d and e) Flow cytometry
  assessment of cell apoptosis by annexin-V/PI (d) and two representative groups after
  transient knockdown of FGFR1 in HUH-7 and HUH-7/R cells was statistically analyzed
  (e). (f)–(l) Western blotting analysis of p-FGFR1/FGFR1, cleaved caspase 3, cleaved
  caspase 9, Bax, and Bcl-2 was carried out in HUH-7 and HUH-7/R cells after transient
  knockdown of FGFR1 and combined treatment with sorafenib and DJ-1. NS: Not significant,
  ∗P < 0.05 versus DJ-1 group, and ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the vehicle or DJ-1 alone.'
