caption: 'Effects of different structural procyanidins on the nuclear factor-erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ARE Pathway in the PC12 cell PD model. (a) Protein levels
  of Nrf2, as determined by Western blotting. (b) Nrf2/GAPDH protein relative expression
  (ratio to control). (c) Protein expression levels of nuclear Nrf2 and cytoplasmic
  Nrf2, as determined by Western blotting. (d) Nuclear Nrf2/LaminB protein relative
  expression (ratio to control). (e) Cytoplasmic Nrf2/GAPDH protein relative expression
  (ratio to control). (f) Protein levels of HO-1 and NQO1, as determined by Western
  blotting; (g) HO-1/GAPDH protein relative expression (ratio to control). (h) NQO1/GAPDH
  protein relative expression (ratio to control). Control, Blank control group; Model,
  MPP+ (1.5 mM); Positive control, Deprenyl (30 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); C: C (5 μM) +
  MPP+ (1.5 mM); EC: EC (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); ECG: ECG (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); B1:
  B1 (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); B2: B2 (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); B3: B3 (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5
  mM); B4: B4 (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); B1-G: B1-G (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); B2-G: B2-G
  (5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM); C1: C1(5 μM) + MPP+ (1.5 mM). Data are expressed as the
  mean ± SD. All experiments were conducted three times. Different letters (a–g) on
  the bar represent significant differences, while the same letters represent no significant
  differences (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA).'
