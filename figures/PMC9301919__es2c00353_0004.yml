caption: 'Changes in the global warming potential, eutrophication potential, ecotoxicity
  potential, and acidification potential in three different crop production systems
  after substituting half of the conventional phosphate rock-based fertilizers with
  wastewater-derived phosphorus products from six different RPs compared to the baseline
  pathway. Within a RP for a given crop, each dot is a scenario—one of the 27 combinations
  of the influent pollutant concentration, sludge disposal method, and carbon intensity
  of grid electricity. RP1: struvite from the digester supernatant; RP2: Ca–P from
  the digester supernatant; RP3 and RP4: rhenania phosphate-like product from the
  incinerated sludge ashes (RP4 with CEPT); RP5 and RP6: single superphosphate from
  the incinerated sludge ashes (RP6 with CEPT).'
