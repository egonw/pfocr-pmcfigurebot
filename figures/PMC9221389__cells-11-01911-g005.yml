caption: 'DEGs analysis of mRNA-seq data. (A) Volcano map of the difference in gene
  expression between injured and uninjured areas of the same heart on day 3 post-MI;
  and (B) for day 7 post-MI; (C) for day 14 post-MI. The filter conditions are the
  same as above: |log2 FC| > 1 and p < 0.05. (D) Line chart of S100a8 and S100a9 expression
  change after MI in the mRNA-seq data. (E) Venn diagrams of significant DEGs detected
  in injured vs. uninjured areas at 3, 7, and 14 days post-MI.'
