figure_title: MarsGT effectively captures differential regulatory mechanisms and uncovers
  biologically meaningful rare cell populations often missed by other tools
caption: a. A UMAP visualizing the cell clusters predicted by MarsGT, annotated based
  on marker genes. b. The number of cells in each cell cluster, with the red color
  signifying a 95% confidence level for rare cell populations. c. Dotplot depicts
  the expression value and proportion of marker genes for the cell clusters predicted
  by MarsGT. d. Dotplot represents the expression value and proportion of BC marker
  genes for the cell clusters predicted by MarsGT. e. The average gene expression
  across each pathway is calculated using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across
  various BC subpopulations. Pathways within the red box have been validated in the
  literature. f. Pathway enrichment as determined by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
  (GSEA), based on the DEGs of MG-1 and MG-2. The structural constituent of the eye
  lens is the pathway enriched in MG-2, and Sprouting angiogenesis is the pathway
  enriched in MG-1. g. The different peak-gene networks of MG-1 and MG-2. Rectangles
  symbolize the peaks, and their colors represent the mean accessibility of the peak
  in the cell population. Accessibility levels ranging from 0 to 0.1 are denoted as
  1, those from 0.1 to 0.5 as 2, from 0.5 to 1 as 3, and anything above 1 is denoted
  as 4. The color of the line and circle represent the cell populations. The orange
  color signifies genes or relationships unique to MG-1, green indicates those unique
  to MG-2, while blue represents genes or relationships shared between MG-1 and MG-2.
