figure_title: Changes in metabolite abundance induced by chronic hyperglycaemia
caption: a Abundances of selected glycolytic, pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle
  metabolites in control (black bars) and diabetic (red bars) islets stimulated with
  2 mM or 20 mM glucose. (n = 4 animals/genotype). Metabolites were measured by mass
  spectrometry, except for DHAP which was measured with a fluorimetric assay. b Schematic
  of glycolysis. c–f Activity of the indicated glycolytic enzymes in control (black)
  and diabetic (red) islets stimulated with 2 or 20 mM glucose. c Phosphofructokinase
  (PFK, n = 3 animals/genotype). d Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase, n = 3 animals/genotype).
  e Aldolase (n = 4 animals/genotype). f Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH, n = 3 animals/genotype). All panels show individual data points and mean ± s.e.m.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. Source
  data are provided as a Source Data file, and relative abundances of all metabolites
  identified are provided as Supplementary Data file .
