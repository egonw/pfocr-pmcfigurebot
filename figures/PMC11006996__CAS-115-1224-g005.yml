caption: SMC4 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibits apoptosis
  of ID8 cells, which is a key molecule in the process of FoxO1 promoting OC. (A,
  B) The expression level of SMC4 in OC tissues was compared with that in normal epithelial
  tissues in GEO datasets. (C, D) Kaplan–Meier database was used to analyze the OS
  and PFS of OC patients in TCGA and GSE9891 datasets. (E, F) The mRNA and protein
  levels of SMC4 after the transfection of SMC4 high‐expression plasmid or siSMC4
  were detected. (G) Cell viability was analyzed using the CCK‐8 assay. (H) Representative
  images of colonies determined by colony formation experiment. (I–L) The cell proliferation
  detected by EdU (I), cell cycle (J) and apoptosis (L) were determined by flow cytometry;
  (K) G1/S phase marker proteins were detected by western blot. (M) Scratch healing
  assay used to detect cell migration. Scale bars = 400 μm. (N) Cell migration and
  invasion ability were detected by transwell assay. Scale bars = 200 μm. (O) The
  protein expression changes of TGF‐β/Smad and JAK2/STAT3 pathway molecules were detected
  by western blot. ID8 cells stably transfected with shNC or shRNA targeting FoxO1
  were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of C57BL/6 mice (n = 6), and
  intratumoral injection of high‐expression SMC4 lentivirus or control virus. (P)
  The protein expression level of SMC4 was detected in the tumor. (Q) Tumor nodules,
  (R) tumor weight, and (S) the growth curve of tumor volume of mouse xenografts.
