caption: Ribosome association of mRNAs encoding proteins in the TREM2/DAP12 signaling
  pathway was increased in Müller glia of diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced in Rpl22HA
  mice by administration of STZ. Control mice received a vehicle (Veh). Retinas were
  analyzed after 6 weeks of diabetes. Ribosomes from Müller glia of Rpl22HA-expressing
  homozygous mice were isolated from retina homogenates by immunoprecipitation (IP)
  and examined by RNA sequencing. Mice were fed either an HFHS diet or control chow.
  Retinas were analyzed 6 weeks after initiation of diet. (A, B) Volcano plot of sequencing
  analysis for STZ diabetic versus Veh control mice (A) and HFHS diet versus chow
  (B) with mRNAs exhibiting increased (green) or decreased (red) Rpl22HA association
  shown. (C) Overlap in mRNAs exhibiting changes in Rpl22HA association in mice receiving
  STZ versus Veh or HFHS diet versus chow was visualized by Venn diagram. (D) Heatmap
  (left) illustrates mRNAs exhibiting changes in ribosome association in both models.
  Expanded view of heatmap (right) depicts only the mRNAs exhibiting codirectional
  changes in the two models, with log fold change (FC) value shown in white. (E) Cartoon
  of TREM2/DAP12 signaling to activate Syk kinase is shown. (F) Results from the sequencing
  analysis for DAP12 (Tyrobp), TREM2, and CSF1R. (G) DAP12, TREM2, and CSF1R mRNA
  abundance was examined in whole retinal lysates by quantitative PCR (qPCR). (H)
  Ribosome-associated mRNAs from Müller glia were isolated by immunoprecipitation.
  DAP12, TREM2, and CSF1R mRNA abundance was examined in retinal immunoprecipitate
  by qPCR. Values are means ± SD. *P < 0.05 versus Veh or chow.
