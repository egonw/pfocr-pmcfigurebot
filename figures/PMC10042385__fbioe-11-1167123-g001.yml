caption: The “green synthesis” pathway of BioSeNPs and applications. Na2SeO3 was added
  to the fermentation medium of microbes (bacteria, yeast and fungi) to produce nano-selenium
  cells. The nano-selenium particles were collected by centrifugation, wall breaking,
  extraction and freeze-drying. Through TEM, FTIR, EDX, XRD and UV-visible spectroscopy,
  the morphology and content of nano-selenium can be observed and characterized. The
  applications of nano-selenium are broad, mainly including anticancer agents, antimicrobial
  agents, bioremediation sensors and so on.
