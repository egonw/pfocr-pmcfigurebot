caption: Siglec-15 interacts with Glut1 to regulate macrophage polarization. (a) Immunoblotting
  of cell lysate co-transformed with Siglec-15-FLAG+Glut1-HA with FLAG antibody immunoprecipitation.
  (b) GST protein pulldown results of GST/GST-Glut1 protein and Glut1 protein. (c)
  qPCR assay indicated that knocking down Glut1 can overexpress Siglec-15-induced
  upregulation of Arg1 expression which was a biomarker of M2 phenotype macrophage.
  (d) Western blotting assay indicated that knocking down Glut1 can overexpress Siglec-15-induced
  upregulation of Arg1 expression which was a biomarker of M2 phenotype macrophage.
  (e) qPCR assay indicates that knocking down Glut1 can overexpress Siglec-15-induced
  upregulation of iNOS which is another biomarker of M2 phenotype macrophage. (f)
  Western blotting assay indicate that knocking down Glut1 can overexpress Siglec-15-induced
  upregulation of iNOS which is another biomarker of M2 phenotype macrophage. The
  experiments were repeated three times, and each experiment was triplicated.
