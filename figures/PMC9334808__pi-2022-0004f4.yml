caption: 'Validation of some of the genes identified using RNA-Seq. After monkeys
  were chronically exposed to MA, cocaine, or heroin, total RNA was extracted from
  the hippocampus and analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain
  reaction. A: Heatmap of the genes identified after normalizing the expression values
  of the genes selected from RNA-Seq data and converting the values to z-scores. B:
  The expression levels of genes involved in axon guidance (PTPRO and KAL1), the ephrin
  receptor signaling pathway (ADAM10), the cell cycle (TLK2), the regulation of potassium
  ions (DPP10), and transport (ATP6V1A). C: The expression levels of genes selected
  from the top networks involved in the MA-treated (n=4), cocaine-treated (n=4), and
  heroin-treated (n=3) groups compared to the control group (n=3). D: The expression
  levels of genes involved in synaptic long-term potentiation. *Significantly different
  from the control (p<0.05). MA, methamphetamine.'
