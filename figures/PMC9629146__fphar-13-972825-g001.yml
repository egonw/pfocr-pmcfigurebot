caption: Chemical structure of licoricidin and its inhibitory effect on the proliferation
  of MGC-803 cells. (A) Three-dimensional (3D) chemical structure of licoricidin,
  downloaded from Pubchem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/480865). (B)
  Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of licoricidin on MCG-803 cells. Cells
  were treated with licoricidin (1.5625, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μM)
  for 24 h. OD values at 450 nm were detected by CCK-8 assay, and then the IC50 was
  calculated by Graphpad Prism 8.0. (C) Licoricidin inhibited the proliferation of
  MGC-803 cells via CCK-8 assay. Cells were administrated with licoricidin (5 μM,
  10, and 20 μM) for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (D) Colony formation of MGC-803 cells treated
  with licoricidin. (E) EdU-positive cells detected by the EdU staining test (×100).
  MGC-803 cells were exposed to licoricidin (5 μM, 10, and 20 μM) or 5-fluorouracil
  20 μM for 24 h. Results are displayed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. LCD, licoricidin. 5-FU,
  5-fluorouracil.
