figure_title: PPARδ activation restores tumour growth and T cell exclusion in the
  absence of GOT2
caption: '(A) Viable cell measurements in control or sgGot2 PDAC cells treated with
  vehicle or 100 nM GW501516. (B) PDAC tumour weight at experimental endpoint, 30
  days after orthotopic transplantation of the control or sgGot2 cells, with daily
  i.p. injection of vehicle or 4 mg/kg GW501516. Ctrl: n = 5 per cohort, sgGot2: n
  = 4 per cohort. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by one-way
  ANOVA. (C) Immunohistochemical staining of control and sgGot2 688M tumours treated
  with vehicle or GW501516 as in B for T cell marker CD3. Representative images are
  shown above (scale bar = 50 μm), with quantification below (Ctrl: n = 5, Ctrl +
  GW501516: n = 5, sgGot2: n = 3, sgGot2 + GW501516: n = 4). Data are presented as
  mean ± s.e.m. **p < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA. (D) Immunohistochemical staining for
  PTGS2/COX2 in control or sgGot2 PDAC treated with vehicle or GW501516 (representative
  of n = 3-5 per cohort). Scale bar = 50 μm. (E) Viable cell measurements in control
  or sgGot2 PDAC cells stably transduced with empty vector or VP16-PPARδ. Data are
  presented as mean ± s.e.m. (F,G) PDAC tumour weight at experimental endpoint in
  the indicated (F) 688M and (G) FC1245 lines. 688M: Ctrl: n = 5, sgGot2: n = 4, Ctrl
  VP16-PPARδ: n = 4, sgGot2 VP16-PPARδ: n = 4, endpoint = day 27. FC1245: Ctrl: n
  = 5, sgGot2: n = 5, Ctrl VP16-PPARδ: n = 5, sgGot2 VP16-PPARδ: n = 4, endpoint =
  day 18. Ctrl and sgGot2 FC1245 arms here are also depicted in . *p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA. (H) qPCR for PPARδ-regulated
  genes in the indicated FC1245 stable cell lines, normalized to 36b4. Data are presented
  as mean ± s.e.m. from biological triplicates. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA. (I) PDAC tumour weight at experimental endpoint
  (day 18) in Ctrl (n = 4) and shPpard (n = 5 per hairpin) FC1245 tumours. **p < 0.01
  by one-way ANOVA. (J) Quantification of CD3 immunohistochemistry on the tumours
  from I (scale bar = 50 μm). *p < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA. (K) Heatmap depicting differentially
  expressed genes in control and sgGot2 FC1245 PDAC cells, untreated or treated with
  500 nM GW501516 for 24 h (n = 3 per group), identified by RNA-seq using cut-off
  criteria padj < 0.01 and logFC < −1 or > 1 in at least one comparison. (L) Venn
  diagram showing RNA-seq results by the criteria in K, with sample gene identities
  at the overlap listed. Overlapping gene frequency: ***p < 0.001 by permutation test.
  (M) MSigDB pathway analysis showing top ten enriched pathways of genes at the overlap
  in L.'
