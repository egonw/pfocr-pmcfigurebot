caption: 'Effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on several metabolic pathways.
  Activation of AMPK represses anabolic processes by affecting the activities of several
  proteins which play crucial roles in protein, fatty acid, sterol, and cholesterol
  synthesis: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase (HMGR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein (SREBP), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). In addition,
  AMPK stimulates catabolic processes to produce ATP. The phosphorylation of CREB-regulated
  transcription coactivator 2 (CRT2) may allow for its sequestration into the cytoplasm
  and prevents its nuclear translocation, reducing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activator
  receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). In association with the transcription
  factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO),
  PGC-1 α stimulates the transcription of genes codifying glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)
  and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) involved in gluconeogenesis. AMPK
  increases glucose flux along the glycolytic pathway by phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
  3 (PFKFB3), which affects the phosphofructokinase-1 activity, a rate-limiting enzyme
  in glycolysis. The phosphorylation by AMPK and inhibition of ACC results in lower
  levels of malonyl-CoA, which is an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1
  (CPT1). This indirectly stimulates the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria,
  increasing fatty oxidation, while inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. AMPK induces
  autophagy both directly by Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) phosphorylation,
  and indirectly by mTORC1 inactivation (see Figure 6 for further details). AMP deaminase
  (AMPD) and its metabolite UA inhibit AMPK, while AMPK inhibits AMPD (see text for
  the metabolic implications). CREB: cAMP response element-binding protein; FAS: fatty
  acid synthase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin complex; RAPTOR: regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR; TSC2: tuberous sclerosis complex; : activation; : inhibition; :
  increase; : decrease.  indicates lack of nuclear translocation and therefore loss
  of transcription of the target genes.'
