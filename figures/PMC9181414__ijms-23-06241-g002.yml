caption: Mutations in genes of the Notch signaling pathway in different types of tumors.
  At the top of the figure, gain-of-function (blue) and loss-of-function (red) mutations
  for various types of tumors are shown. Below, a schematic representation of the
  Notch signaling pathway is shown, with the locations of the gain- and loss-of-function
  Notch mutations in the Notch receptor depicted, along with mutations in the MAML
  and FBXW7 genes.
