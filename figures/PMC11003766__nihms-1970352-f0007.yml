figure_title: Gene, gene set, and signature TCGA analysis
caption: (a) Heatmap of the hazard ratios (natural log-transformed) associated with
  the co-culture screen gene signature in TCGA patients for 33 cancer types (a positive
  log-ratio indicates a worse prognosis and a negative one indicates a protective
  effect of the gene signature). The co-culture screen gene signature was scaled to
  mean=0, SD=1. Values shown only for cancer types with significant survival and signature
  association in patient tumours, as determined by a Wald test with Benjamini-Hochberg
  multiple comparisons correction (two-sided padj < 0.05). (b, d) Correlation of tumour
  gene expression and survival in the low-grade glioma (LGG) patient cohort, (b) with
  the entire cohort and (d) with the cohort split according to TRGV9/TRDV2 tumour
  transcript abundance. Patients with high and low expression of every given gene
  were compared across the 1040 genes in the co-culture screen signature. Positive
  Wald test Z score indicates a positive correlation with survival, and negative Z
  score indicates a negative correlation with survival. (c, e) Correlation of KEGG
  pathway-derived and type I interferon response pathway-derived signature scores
  and survival in the low-grade glioma (LGG) patient cohort, (c) with the entire cohort
  and (e) with the cohort split according to TRGV9/TRDV2 tumour transcript abundance.
  Patients with high and low pathway signature scores were compared. (f, g) Survival
  of (f) all LGG patients and (g) TRGV9/TRDV2-high or TRGV9/TRDV2-low LGG patients
  split by high and low expression of the TCA cycle pathway signature. (h, i) Survival
  of TRAC/TRBC-high/low (h) LGG and (i) BLCA patients split by high and low expression
  of the co-culture screen gene signature. (b-e) Significance was determined by a
  Wald test (Cox regression) with Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction (two-sided
  padj<0.05). (f-i) Log-rank test (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis), adjusted (padj)
  with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons correction. (c, e-g) Pathway signature
  levels were estimated by limiting the comparison to genes that overlapped between
  the co-culture screen hits signature and the pathway.
