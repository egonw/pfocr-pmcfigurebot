caption: Expression of antimicrobial molecule-encoding genes quantified using real-time
  PCR. (a) Gene expression (normalized to cyc-1, act-1, and tba-1) relative to that
  in Escherichia coli OP50-fed wild-type worms is shown. Statistical analyses were
  performed using two-tailed t-tests. **P < 0.01, *P < .05. Error bars represent SE
  of 3 independent experiments. (b, c) 16S rRNA expression for SK137 (normalized to
  act-1 mRNA) in OP50-fed worms relative to that in SK137-fed group (b), and 16S rRNA
  expression for OP50 (normalized to act-1 mRNA) in SK137-fed worms relative to that
  in OP50-fed control (c) are shown. Differences in the relative expression were tested
  for significance using the two-tailed t-tests. *P < .05. Error bars represent SE
  of 3 independent experiments. Detailed data for real-time PCR targeting 16S rRNAs
  are provided in .
