caption: Potential mechanisms of miR-23b-3p inhibition of cell apoptosis and tau phosphorylation
  via repression of the GSK-3β signaling pathway in ADmiR-23b-3p ameliorates cognitive
  dysfunction in AD against tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis via directly
  targeting GSK-3β-mediated p-tau/Bax/caspase-3 pathways. In addition, miR-23b-3p
  reduces Aβ production, possibly via regulating the GSK-3β-associated nonamyloidogenic
  pathway. 3′ UTR, 3′untranslated region; Aβ, amyloid-β peptides; ADAM10, disintegrin
  and metalloprotease 10; BACE1, beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1; Bax, BCL2-associated
  X protein; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β.
