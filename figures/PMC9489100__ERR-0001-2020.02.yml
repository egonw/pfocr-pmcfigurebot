caption: 'Type I interferon (IFN) activity regulation and monogenic interferonopathies.
  Both inappropriate activation (e.g. triggered by self-nucleic acids) and impaired
  negative regulation of the type I IFN system can give rise to interferonopathies
  (red border boxes). Nucleic acid-driven inflammation may originate either from disruption
  in the sensing machinery or PPR downstream mediators, as well as impairment of their
  processing, metabolism (including autophagy) and repair. In turn, aberrant activity
  of deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, DNA polymerase, RNA helicase, RNA editing machinery,
  polynucleotide phosphorylase, N-deglycosylation, dsDNA break repairs and ER-localised
  UPR may account for overproduction of type I IFNs. Furthermore, aberrancies in the
  proteasome component have been proposed to induce type I IFN signalling through
  indirect effects upon nucleic acid species processing. Overall, aberrant type I
  IFN enhancement may be due to either: 1) abnormal stimulation (e.g. increased accumulation
  or change in composition of endogenous nucleic acids); 2) aberrant sensing (e.g.
  constitutive activation or enhanced sensitivity of PPRs, leading to a change in
  threshold at which endogenous nucleic acids are sensed); 3) perpetuated activation
  (e.g. increased sensitivity or constitutive activation of IFN-inducing mediators
  other than PPRs); or 4) impaired negative regulation (e.g. unrestrained signalling
  due to defective negative feedback). A key negative regulator of this loop is represented
  by the ISG15, which causes induction of USP18 that, in turn, inhibits IFNAR2 activity,
  thus providing negative feedback to restrain an appropriate type I IFN pathway activity.
  Genes causing monogenic interferonopathies are depicted by red border boxes. Red
  question marks indicate unknown mechanisms. Yellow border boxes indicate genes suggested
  to cause type I IFN signalling aberrancies, but putative mechanisms are provisional.
