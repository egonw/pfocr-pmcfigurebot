caption: NF response in VSMN. In (A) first and fourth columns display the first frame
  (8 × 8) of an input sequence that consists of dots (2 × 2) moving in specific direction
  with two speeds. The second, third, fifth, and sixth columns represent the corresponding
  NF (48 × 48) activity. The same neuron population become selective to the inputs
  of same direction and different speeds, however within the population neurons have
  different speed preferences which are shown in (B) the velocity selective map. Neuron
  direction preferences are shown by head of the arrow and the speed preferences are
  shown by the arrow color. Color bars indicate 16 input types (8 directions × 2 speeds).
  1–8 belong to speed-1 and 9–16 to speed-2. (C) shows the architecture of CNN. (D)
  shows the confusion matrix obtained for the test set.
