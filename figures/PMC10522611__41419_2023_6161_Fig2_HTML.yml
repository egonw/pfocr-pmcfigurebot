figure_title: Cell viability evaluation and live cell cycle detection
caption: 'Cell viability was evaluated by MTS assay, on Hepa-RG cells, after incubation
  with Healthy-Exo and NAFLD-Exo samples (A, B), alone or in combination with free
  PA (fPA) or OA (fOA) at different concentrations (5–100 µM), hybrid exosomes (PA/Healthy-Exo
  and OA/NAFLD-Exo) and fPA or fOA at 100 μM. Representative bright-field images of
  live Hepa-RG cells stained with CellClock™ Dye Reagent to monitor the four major
  cell cycle phases: dark green-blue (G2/M phases), light green (S phase) and Yellow
  (G0/G1 Phases) (C). Cells were treated with exosomes derived from healthy subjects
  and NAFLD patients, or hybrid exosomes loaded with FA. Scale bar 50 μm. The histogram
  represents the quantification of differences (%) between the different cell cycle
  phases (D). The exosomes concentration in terms of the total protein content was
  fixed at 20 µg/µL. The PA and OA concentrations were 10 and 13.5 µM respectively
  in PA/Healthy-Exo and OA/NAFLD-Exo samples. Negative controls were untreated cells
  (CTR). Experiments were repeated three times. **P < 0.001.'
