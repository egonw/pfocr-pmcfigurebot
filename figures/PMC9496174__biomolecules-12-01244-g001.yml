caption: 'The cellular Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway. Once the
  different agonists bind to the AHR receptor, conformational changes in the complex
  appeared, leading to the activation of AHR, nuclear translocation, and a series
  of the downstream gene expression, which plays an important role in the inflammation-related
  diseases. Abbreviations: HSP90,90 kDa heat shock protein; AIP, AHR-interacting protein;
  ARNT, AHR nuclear translocator; XREs, xenobiotic response elements; AHRR, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor repressor; CYP, Cytochrome P450.'
