caption: 'Metformin can ameliorate UVA-induced photoaging on HFFs. (a) HFFs were treated
  with metformin (0−800 μM) alone or in combination with UVA, the cell viability of
  HFFs were detected by MTT assay. (b) Cells were treated with UVA alone or in combination
  with 100 μM metformin, the activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and
  the percentage of cells positive for SA-β-gal activity (40×) were measured. (c)
  Cells were treated with UVA alone or in combination with 100 μM metformin, flow
  cytometry system analysis was used to detect the phase of the cell cycle in cells.
  (d,e) Cells were treated with UVA alone or in combination with 100 μM metformin,
  the protein levels of P53, P16, P21, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl−2, Bak, Mcl−1 were
  measured by western blot. Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. #p < 0.05, ##p
  < 0.01 vs. control cells, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. UVA-treated cells.'
