figure_title: The ACh-M1R-PKC cascade activates PAK signaling in striatum/accumbal
  slices ex vivo
caption: A, B Striatal/accumbal slices were pretreated with the M1R-specific antagonist
  VU0255035 (20 μM) or the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (10 μM) for 90 min and were then
  stimulated with carbachol for 5 min. NR1 phosphorylation, PAK autophosphorylation,
  and LIMK phosphorylation were quantified by immunoblotting over four independent
  experiments. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. C
  Striatal/accumbal slices were pretreated with the group I-specific PAK inhibitor
  FRAX486 (20 μM) for 6 h and were then treated with carbachol (1 mM) for 5 min. NR1
  phosphorylation, PAK autophosphorylation, LIMK phosphorylation, and cofilin phosphorylation
  were quantified by immunoblotting over four independent experiments. The error bars
  represent the mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, n.s. not significant,
  **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001.
