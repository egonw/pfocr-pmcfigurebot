caption: Genes of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and gossypol pathway and their enzymes.
  Genes that contribute to the synthesis of gossypol and the enzymes that regulate
  their expression are presented for each step of the MVA pathway and gossypol pathway.
  Genes encoding identified enzymes or having expression patterns connected to gossypol
  biosynthesis are shown at the top. The enzymes involved in the MVA pathway and gossypol
  pathway, and intermediates include ACAT, acyl CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase; DMAPP,
  dimethylallyl diphosphate; FPS, FPP synthase; HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A
  (HMG-CoA) synthase; MVK, mevalonate kinase; MVP, phosphomevalonate kinase; PMD,
  diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; and IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate. Different enzymes
  then catalyze the conversion of (+)-δ-cadinene, 7-hydroxy-(+)-δ-cadinene, and 7-keto-δ-cadinene
  to gossypol. Dashed arrows indicate unidentified reactions of the gossypol pathway.
