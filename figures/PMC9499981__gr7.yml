caption: Metabolic pathways with higher-than-average mRNA-protein correlations may
  reflect differential reproducibilityBar charts displaying the KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of the CCLE mRNA-protein correlation before (left) and after (right) accounting
  for protein-protein and mRNA-mRNA reproducibility. The −log10 of Benjamini-Hochberg
  false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p values calculated using Mann-Whitney U test
  is used to assess enrichment for the pathway. For each bar chart, the gray line
  indicates the threshold considered for significant enrichment (FDR < 0.05). If the
  enrichment is below the threshold, then it is not considered significant. The bars
  are colored orange if the median mRNA-protein correlation of genes within the pathway
  is greater than the median mRNA-protein correlation of genes not in the pathway;
  otherwise, the bars are colored blue.
