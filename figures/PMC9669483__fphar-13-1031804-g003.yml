caption: (A) Effect of TNF-α on mechanical withdrawal threshold in control group rats.
  Decreased mechanical withdraw threshold in control rats (n = 5) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 h
  after intramuscular injection of TNF-α (0.1 mg/ml). (B). TNF-α (0.1 mg/ml) could
  induce the high expressions of p-P65, MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC. Expression levels were
  detected 2 h after injection of TNF-α or DMSO and the differences were statistically
  significant. (C). The mRNA expression levels of MLCK, MEF2C, and MyoC were higher
  in the MTrPs group and TNF-α group than in the control group, with GAPDH as the
  internal reference mRNA. (D). Using GAPDH as cytoplasmic protein internal reference
  and Lamin B as cytosolic protein internal reference, the nuclear protein expression
  of MEF2C was higher in both MTrPs and TNF-α groups than in the control group. *p
  < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
