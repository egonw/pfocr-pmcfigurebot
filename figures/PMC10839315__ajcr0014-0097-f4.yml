caption: CTSC knockdown suppressed cell migration and invasion in vitro. A. RT-PCR
  and western blot analysis of CTSC in knockdown of CTSC. B. Wound healing assay in
  knockdown of CTSC. Scale bar, 100 μm. Data are presented as the means ± standard
  deviation and are analyzed using Student’s t-test (n = 3). Scale bar, 20 μm. C,
  D. Transwell migration and invasion assays. The number of cells in five randomly
  chosen fields is counted. Data are presented as the means ± standard deviation and
  are analyzed using Student’s t-test (n = 3). Scale bar, 200 μm. E. Western blot
  analysis showing higher expression of epithelial markers (E-cad and Ep-CAM) and
  TIMP2 and lower expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug),
  MMP, and MMP9 in CTSC knockdown cells than in shCtrl cells. F. AKT, ERK, FAK, and
  YAP expression levels are determined by western blot analysis in cells with CTSC
  overexpression. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
