caption: 'Overexpression of TNFAIP6 promotes EMT in GC cells: (a) the overexpression
  of TNFAIP6 decreased the E-cadherin expression and raised the N-cadherin expression,
  (b) the TOP/FOP luciferase activity assay on TNFAIP6 overexpression of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway (∗∗P < 0.01 compared with vector), (c) the TNFAIP6 increased the nuclear
  translocation of active β-catenin in GC cells, (d) Coexpression regulatory network
  obtained from the String database, (e) changes in TNFAIP6 expression on the mRNA
  level of PTX3 in GC cells.'
