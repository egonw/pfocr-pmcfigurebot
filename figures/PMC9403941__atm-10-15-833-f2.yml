caption: Unsupervised clustering of ferroptosis genes in breast cancer samples. (A)
  The interaction between ferroptosis genes. The size of the circle indicates the
  effect of each gene on survival prediction, and the greater the expression, the
  more relevant the prognosis. Green dots in a circle represent prognostic protective
  factors, and black dots in a circle represent prognostic risk factors. The lines
  linking the genes show their interactions, and negative correlation is denoted by
  blue, while positive correlation is denoted by red. (B) Consistent clustering of
  ferroptosis genes, where 1, 2, and 3 represent the 3 ferr.cluster subgroups. (C)
  Kaplan-Meier curves show significant survival differences among the 3 ferr.cluster
  subgroups. (D) GSVA enrichment analysis demonstrating biological pathway activity
  in various ferr.cluster subgroups. Thermograms are used to visualize these biological
  processes, with red representing activation and blue representing inhibition. (E)
  The distribution and immune infiltration of 28 immune cell types in the 3 ferr.cluster
  subgroups. (F) An analysis of the prognosis of differential cells. In the figures,
  ns (not significant) stands for P>0.05, **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001; ****, P<0.0001.
