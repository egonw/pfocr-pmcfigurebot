figure_title: Compositional and functional profiles of the gut metagenomes of wild
  type (WT) and human-microbiota-associated (HMA) mice
caption: '(A) Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) of microbial community composition
  of all Schistosoma-infected and -uninfected animals in both experiments, determined
  by mapping of shotgun metagenomic reads against bacterial reference genomes available
  from the GenBank database. (B) Alpha diversity. (C) Principal Component Analysis
  (PCA) of pathway relative abundances at community-level as determined by HUMAnN3.
  Asterisks indicate significant differences between groups determined by unpaired
  t-test: **p<0.01; ***p<0.0001.'
article_title: The gut microbial metabolic capacity of microbiome-humanized vs. wild
  type rodents reveals a likely dual role of intestinal bacteria in hepato-intestinal
  schistosomiasis.
