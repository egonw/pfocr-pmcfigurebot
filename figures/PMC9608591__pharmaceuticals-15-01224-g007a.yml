caption: 'IMD upregulated Sirt3 via the AMPK signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis
  of the protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) (T172),
  AMPK, phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA) (T197), PKA, phosphorylated protein
  kinase B (p-Akt) (S473), and Akt in rat VSMCs preincubated with or without the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, the AMPK inhibitor Compound C or the PKA inhibitor
  H89 (all 10 μmol/L) before IMD1–53 administration and calcification induction and
  quantification of (B) p-AMPK/AMPK, (C) p-PKA/PKA, and (D) p-Akt/Akt (n = 3). (E)
  Alizarin red staining (Scale bar = 200 μm), and (F) quantification (n = 3). (G)
  Western blot analysis of protein levels of Sirt3, acetylation-SOD2 (K68) and SOD2
  in rat VSMCs and quantification of (H) acetylation-SOD2 to SOD2 ratio and (I) Sirt3
  (n = 3). (J) SOD2 activity in rat VSMCs (n = 3). (K) DHE probing ROS in rat VSMCs
  (positive staining: red). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Merged images are
  shown (Scale bar = 100 μm). (L) MitoSOX Red probing mitochondrial-derived ROS in
  rat VSMCs (positive staining: red). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Merged
  images are shown (Scale bar = 100 μm). (M,N) Average fluorescence intensity of (M)
  DHE and (N) MitoSOX in rat VSMCs (n = 3). CON (solid circles): control VSMCs, CAL
  (solid squares): calcification VSMCs, CAL + IMD (solid triangles): calcification
  VSMCs with IMD1-53 treatment, CAL + IMD + CC (open circles): calcification VSMCs
  with Compound C pretreatment and IMD1-53 treatment, CAL + IMD + H89 (open squares):
  calcification VSMCs with H89 pretreatment and IMD1-53 treatment, CAL + IMD + LY
  (open triangles): calcification VSMCs with LY294002 pretreatment and IMD1-53 treatment
  Data are mean ± SD.'
