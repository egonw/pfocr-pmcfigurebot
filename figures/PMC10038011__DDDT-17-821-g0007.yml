caption: '(A) Hs 578T cells were administered with 25 μM ICA for 24 h with or without
  anisomycin for the Western blot analysis. (B–E) The protein expression of Phosphor-JNK,
  JNK, phosphor-c-Jun and c-IAP2. (F and G) Hs 578T cells invasion ability was detected
  by the transwell assay; n = 3. Mean ± S.D. Data are representative of 3 independent
  determinations. **p < 0.01, compared with the control group; ##p < 0.01, compared
  with the experimental group.'
