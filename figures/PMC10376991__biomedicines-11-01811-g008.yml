caption: A model for the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative mechanisms of the MITF–GAS5–miR-23
  loop in sepsis vascular endothelium. As shown in this figure, after endothelial
  cells are stimulated by ROS, the pi3k–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway is inhibited, causing
  the MiT–TFE transcription factor to enter the nucleus, participate in the transcription
  of GAS5, and form a positive feedback loop. At the same time, the transcription
  of Nrf2 and P62 is also activated, and autophagy behavior is dynamically regulated
  according to the degree of oxidative stress. In addition, a mutually fostering transcription
  mechanism exists between Nrf2 and MiT–TFE transcription factors, amplifying the
  effect of the MITF–GAS5–miR-23 loop.
