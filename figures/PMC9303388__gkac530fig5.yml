caption: LP-BER repair of 8oxoG can result in demethylation of nearby CpG sites. In
  the configuration shown above, 8oxoG ('8') is on the 5′ side of a T:G mispair, which
  could arise from the deamination of 5mC. The BER pathway was initiated by the removal
  of 8oxoG ('8') by hOGG1 (lane 2). Repair synthesis by pol β resulted in the insertion
  of G (lane 5), the replacement of the mispaired T with C (lane 7), and completion
  of the repair of the upper strand (lane 8). The CCGG HpaII site was initially blocked
  by the presence of the T:G mispair. However, after repair synthesis, the T:G was
  converted to C:G which allowed HpaII cleavage (lane 9). This result showed that
  BER can also function as an active demethylation pathway.
