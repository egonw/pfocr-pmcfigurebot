caption: MBOP promotes CRC progression through cell migration and proliferation. (A)
  Representative images of expressions of LINC01234ORF and MBOP in HCT116 and HCT15
  after transfection of series plasmids pcDNA3.1+, pORF-FLAG, and pORFmut-FLAG. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD, ** p < 0.005, *** p < 0.0005. (B) Migration ability
  of cells transfected with series plasmids pcDNA3.1+, pORF-FLAG, and pORFmut-FLAG
  were detected with wound healing assay. (C) Migration ability of cells transfected
  with series plasmids pcDNA3.1+, pORF-FLAG, and pORFmut-FLAG were detected with transwell
  assay. (D) Colony formation assays of lentiviral transfected cell lines co-GFP,
  ORF-GFP, and ORFm-GFP. (E) The mRNA and protein expressions of MBOP from primary
  tumors resulted from in vivo plant of lentiviral transfected HCT116 cell lines co-GFP,
  ORF-GFP, and ORFm-GFP. Data are presented as mean ± SD, ** p < 0.005. (F) Mice bearing
  tumor fragments derived from primary tumors of (E), and the relative tumor volumes
  were recorded (n = 4). Data are presented as mean ± SD, **** p < 0.0001. The representative
  images of the immunohistochemistry assay are shown in the right panel.
