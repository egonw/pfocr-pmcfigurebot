caption: 'CD4+T cell immunity causes breast cancer terminal differentiation. (A) Representative
  images of TUNEL assay (upper panels) and immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 (lower
  panels) on Tslp-PyMttg and PyMttg tumors (scale bar: 100 μm). (B) Percentage Ki67+
  cells in Tslp-PyMTtg (n = 9) and PyMTtg (n = 6) breast tumors. Quantifications were
  performed in 10 HPF images per tumor sample stained with Ki67. Each dot represents
  a tumor sample (Mann–Whitney U test). Bar graph shows mean + SD. (C) Scatter plot
  showing genes differentially regulated in Tslp-PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell compared
  with PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell. Dots highlighted in yellow and blue represent
  genes up- or down-regulated in Tslp-PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell versus PyMttg Rag1KO
  + CD4+ T cell, respectively (n = 3 per group, false discovery rate ≤ 0.001 and log2
  ratio ≥ 1). Genes of interest are indicated with their symbol or complete name.
  (D) Pathway enrichment analysis of genes associated with differential H3K27Ac mark
  in the tumors of Tslp-PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell compared with PyMttg Rag1KO +
  CD4+ T cells (n = 2 per group). (E) Heatmap showing increased H3K27Ac mark in the
  enhancer region of genes associated with EMT in PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell (control)
  compared with Tslp-PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell (test) group. (F) Peaks of acetylation
  in the promoter regions (highlighted by black boxes) of representative EMT genes
  in Tslp-PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cells (red tracks) compared with PyMttg Rag1KO +
  CD4+ T cells (blue tracks). (G and H) Western blot for breast epithelial (MUC1,
  β-casein, and E-cadherin), mesenchymal (vimentin), and regulator of proliferation
  (p21) markers on tumor lysates from Tslp-PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cells, PyMttg Rag1KO
  + CD4+ T cells, and normal mammary gland (G) and Tslp-PyMttg, PyMttg, and normal
  mammary gland (H). GAPDH is used as the control housekeeping protein. (I) Quantification
  of protein bands in Tslp-PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell and Tslp-PyMttg groups (test
  tumors) compared with PyMttg Rag1KO + CD4+ T cell and PyMttg groups (control tumors)
  and WT breast glands (Mann–Whitney U test). Bar graphs show mean + SD. Each of the
  tumors in the studies is from a separate mouse. All experimental data verified in
  at least two independent experiments. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.0001.'
