caption: Under homeostatic conditions regarding canonical pathway of Nrf2, Nrf2 is
  degraded via formation of the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex and ubiquitination. Due
  to the stress-associated oxidative modification of Keap1, Nrf2 dissociates from
  the Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex and translocates to the nucleus. In the non-canonical
  pathway under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 binds to β-TrCP via its phosphorylation
  mediated by GSK3. Following this, Nrf2 is ubiquitinated and degraded due to interaction
  between β-TrCP and Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Cannabidiol (CBD) can
  modulate the redox status of cells by interfering with canonical and non-canonical
  pathways of Nrf2 and altering the level of proteins and miRNAs participating in
  Nrf2 activity. (The black and blue dashed arrows are used for canonical and non-canonical
  pathways, respectively; the dark green or soft-green arrows are used for CBD-mediated
  increase or decrease in the level of proteins and miRNAs, respectively; the black
  or end-cut arrows are used for up-regulation and down-regulation of Nrf2 activity,
  respectively; Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, Keap1; Cullin-based E3 ligase
  (Cul3); RING-box protein 1 (RBX1); glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3); beta-transducin
  repeats-containing protein (β-TrCP); Cullin 1 (Cul1); antioxidant response element
  (ARE); protein kinase B (Akt); mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs); c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase, JNK; extracellular response kinase, ERK; B-cell lymphoma 2, Bcl-2;
  CREB-binding protein (CBP); sirtuin1 (SIRT1); micro-RNA, miRNAs/miR). (For interpretation
