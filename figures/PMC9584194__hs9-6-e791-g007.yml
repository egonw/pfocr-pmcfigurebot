caption: Eplerenone prevented Carfilzomib-induced SGK-1/MR activation in the kidneys
  and restored the metabolic profile in the kidneys, urine, and plasma in vivo. (A)
  Representative Western blot images and (B) relative densitometry analysis of mineralocorticoid
  receptor (MR)–SGK-1 related proteins in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of the
  kidneys (n = 6 per group). (C) Three-dimensional representation of principal components
  analysis (PCA) of the proteomic analysis of the kidneys, urine, and plasma (n =
  6 per group) and (D) metabolite enrichment overview of the top 25 metabolic pathways
  as emerged from the metabolomic analysis and MetaboAnalyst 5.0 software with enrichment
  and P value ascension. Blue scatter bars refer to the controls and red scatter bars
  refer to Cfz groups. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. All phosphorylated proteins
  are normalized to their respective total proteins and total proteins are normalized
  to α-actinin (loading control). Student’s T-Test, unpaired, 2-tailed. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.001. β-ENaC = epithelial sodium channel ENaC beta subunit;
  MR = mineralocorticoid receptor; NEDD4 = neural precursor cell expressed developmentally
  down-regulated protein 4; SGK-1 = serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1; Uta1
  = urea transporter A1.
