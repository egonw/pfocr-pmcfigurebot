caption: 'Effects of HIIT and MICT on the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in skeletal
  muscle of HFD mice. (A–D) Expression of cGAS-STING signaling pathway-related proteins
  (n = 3 for each group). (E,F) Serum IL-6 and IFN-β levels (n = 7 for HFD, n = 7
  for MH, n = 8 for HH). All data are presented as mean ± SEM. # p < 0.05, ## p <
  0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs. Group HFD.'
