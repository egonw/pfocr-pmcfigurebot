caption: Immunologic mechanism of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), emerged as the most
  promising and widely used mRNA delivery platforms. LNPs excel in the efficient delivery
  of mRNA by merging with the lipid bilayer of early endosomes, thereby facilitating
  the transport of mRNA into the cytosol. Upon vaccination and uptake by antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs), the mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes antigen
  processing and enters the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation pathway.
  This results in the presentation of antigens by APCs on MHC class I and II molecules,
  subsequently activating CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells, respectively. CD4+ T cells also
  play a role in stimulating antigen-specific B cells, leading to the initiation of
  a humoral immune response.
