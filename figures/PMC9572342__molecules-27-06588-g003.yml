caption: The effect of naringenin (250 µM), BPA (4.4 µM), FEN (37%), co-treatment
  naringenin and FEN with BPA, and blank of fermentation (10%) on HT-29 cells viability
  was evaluated after 24 h incubation by MTT assay. The experimental data are expressed
  as the mean value ± SD of the three independent experiments with three replicates
  each one. Letters indicate statistical difference (p < 0.05).
article_title: Fermentation Extract of Naringenin Increases the Expression of Estrogenic
  Receptor β and Modulates Genes Related to the p53 Signalling Pathway, miR-200c and
  miR-141 in Human Colon Cancer Cells Exposed to BPA.
