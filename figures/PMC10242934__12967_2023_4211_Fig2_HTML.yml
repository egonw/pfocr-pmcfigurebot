caption: Functional characterisation of metabolic G3/G4 clusters in examined cohorts.
  IPA canonical pathway analysis of upregulated DEGs comparing solely clusters dominated
  by G3/G4 MB has been performed. Pathways are presented for A I_G3/4.1, B I_G3/4.2,
  C I_G3/4.3, D M_G3/4.1, E M_G3/4.2, F M_G3/4.3. Pathways that overlap in content
  across clusters are printed in bold. Behind each pathway, the number of DEGs matching
  this pathway is listed in brackets. G Sankey plot illustrating relationships between
  metabolic clusters in ICGC and MAGIC based on DEGs of each cluster as outlined in
  the Additional file . The width of each bar representing a cluster refers to the
  total number of DEGs which overlap with clusters from the other cohort. IP = inositol
  phosphate; EMT = epithelial–mesenchymal transition
