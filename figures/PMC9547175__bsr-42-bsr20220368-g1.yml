figure_title: Overview of sulfur acquisition and assimilation pathways in bacteria
caption: Inorganic sulfur uptake and assimilation pathways converge to be separately
  condensed with O-acetylserine to form cysteine. Transcriptional regulator, CysB,
  up-regulates the sulfur uptake (cysPUWA, sbp) and sulfur reduction pathways (cysC,D,G,H,I,J,N),
  in the presence of the readily forming O-acetylserine isoform, N-acetylserine. Cysteine
  feeds into de novo synthesis of sulfur-containing metabolites, such as methionine,
  glutathione, thioredoxin and Fe-S clusters. Cysteine inhibits CysE via feedback
  inhibition. Cysteine can be catabolized by cysteine desulfhydrase to release pyruvate,
  ammonia and sulfide.
