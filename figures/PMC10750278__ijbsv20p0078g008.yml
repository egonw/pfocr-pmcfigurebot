caption: Effect of SECTM1 knockdown in U87 MG on tumorigenicity in mice. Image of
  BALB/c nude mice after subcutaneous neoplasia (A). Statistical analysis of tumor
  volume (B) and body weight (C) (n = 4) in nude mice measured every 2 days. Image
  of mouse subcutaneous tumor removal (D) and statistical analysis of tumor weight
  (E). Expression image of SECTM1 and proliferative marker Ki-67 by H&E staining and
  IHC analysis in control or shSECTM1 xenograft tumor tissue (F), scale, 2 µm. (G)
  Relative expression percentage of Ki67 in IHC. The data represent the mean ±SEM
  of the T-test analysis through three independent experiments, *P < 0.05; ** P <0.01;
  *** P < 0.001; **** P < 0.0001.
article_title: SECTM1 promotes the development of glioblastoma and mesenchymal transition
  by regulating the TGFβ1/Smad signaling pathway.
