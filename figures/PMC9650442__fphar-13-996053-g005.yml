caption: 'Blocking K-Ras mutation reduced the suppressive effect of SCH772984 treatment
  on cancer stemness markers in HCT-116 cells. The flow cytometry analysis of the
  expressions of surface stem markers CD133 (A), CD44 (B), and CD24 (C) in HCT-116
  and HT-29 spheroids following the SCH772984 treatment after the K-Ras G13D mutation
  has been blocked. CD133 and CD44 expressions are increased after the combination
  treatment whereas the expression of CD133, CD44, and CD24 did not increase after
  the same treatment in HT-29 spheroids (D–F). Real-time qPCR results show the stem
  gene CD133 (G), Lgr5 (H), and TGF-β1 (I) expressions for HCT-116 cells. *: p < 0.05;
  **:p < 0.01.'
