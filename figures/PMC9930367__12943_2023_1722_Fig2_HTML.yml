caption: γδT cells gradually become dysfunctional in the tumor microenvironment. During
  tumorigenesis and tumor development, the metabolism of tumor cells is changed, and
  the phosphoantigens produced through the mevalonate pathway increase. ABCA1 and
  apoA-I can act synergistically with BTN proteins to stimulate γδT cells and induce
  the secretion of supraphysiological levels of IPP. Binding to the B30.2 domain causes
  the conformation of BTN3A/BTN2A to change, which promotes γδT-cell antigen recognition,
  proliferation and activation. At the same time, immune checkpoint ligands are highly
  expressed on the surface of tumor cells, which can interfere with the normal TCR
  signaling pathway and transmit inhibitory signals to γδT cells by binding to immune
  checkpoint receptors. Excessive and persistent antigen stimulation and the inhibitory
  signals transmitted because of the high expression of immune checkpoint molecules
  eventually cause γδT cells to enter an anergic or exhausted state, resulting in
  dysfunction and weakened antitumor effects
