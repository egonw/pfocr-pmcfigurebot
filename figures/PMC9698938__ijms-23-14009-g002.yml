caption: Hepatocyte-specific DAX1 deletion exacerbates the severity of ConA-induced
  liver injury in mice. (a) Primary hepatocytes from WT and Dax1 LKO mice were isolated,
  and mRNA extracts from cells were conducted using RT-qPCR to measure the expression
  levels of Dax1 (RT-qPCR was performed in five technical replicates). (b–d) WT and
  hepatocyte-specific Dax1 knockout (LKO) mice were treated with a single administration
  of ConA (15 mg/kg, i.v.) for 0, 3, 6, and 9 h (WT; n = 5–6, LKO; n = 6–7). (b) H&E
  staining was performed in the liver tissues at various time points, and representative
  images are shown. (c) The plasma levels of ALT and AST were measured at the 4-time
  points. (d) The liver samples from WT mice were harvested and subjected to RTqPCR
  for measuring the expression levels of Dax1 at 4-time course after ConA injection
  (five technical replicates for each pooled sample from WT mice). Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare the LKO and WT
  groups (a) and the LKO groups at each time point with respective WT groups (c);
  Tukey–Kramer test after the one-way ANOVA was used to compare each time point with
  zero time (d); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
