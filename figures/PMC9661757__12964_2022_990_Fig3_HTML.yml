caption: Functional enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes by JAK
  depletion. A Volcano plot of the differentially expressed genes in parental and
  JAK1-knockdown KLE cells. Red dots represent up-regulated genes and blue dots represent
  down-regulated genes. B Heatmap depicting the expression of the top 50 differentially
  expressed genes in parental and JAK1-knockdown KLE cells. The left vertical axis
  shows clusters of differentially expressed genes and the right vertical axis represents
  gene names. Red represents upregulated genes and blue represents downregulated genes.
  C Go analysis of the differentially expressed genes in parental and JAK1-knockdown
  KLE cells (biological process). D KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed
  genes in parental and JAK1-knockdown KLE cells
article_title: JAK1 inactivation promotes proliferation and migration of endometrial
  cancer cells via upregulating the hypoxia-inducible factor signaling pathway.
