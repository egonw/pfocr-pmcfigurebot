caption: GDF15 controls macrophage phenotype switch and NF-κB pathway activation in
  mice fibrotic livers. (A) Representative images of flow-cytometric analysis of hepatic
  macrophages from WT and Gdf15 KO mice after CCl4-induced fibrotic livers; recruited
  macrophages (CD11bhi and F4/80intermediate) were further subdivided into Ly6Chi
  and Ly6Clow and its quantification. WT and Gdf15 KO mice were treated with 4 weeks
  of CCl4. Hepatic nonparenchymal cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry.
  (B) Percentage of the CD11bhi and F4/80intermediate expressed cells in liver tissues
  of WT and Gdf15 KO mice after CCl4 injection for 4 weeks (n = 5 mice per group).
  (C) Percentage of the B cells (B220+) and T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) in liver tissues
  of WT and Gdf15 KO mice after CCl4 injection for 4 weeks (n = 5 mice per group).
  (D, E) Dual immunofluorescence staining of CD163 and CD68 in WT and Gdf15 KO mice
  fibrotic livers induced by toxin and cholestasis. (F) Immunofluorescence staining
  of p65 and DAPI in liver tissues. Results are displayed as mean ± SEM. ∗P < .05.
  Statistical significance was assessed by 2-way analysis of variance or Student's
  t test. N.S., no significance.
