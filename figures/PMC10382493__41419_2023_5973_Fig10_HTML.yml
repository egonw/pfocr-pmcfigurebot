figure_title: Mnat9 regulates JNK signaling pathway in developing eye
caption: 'A GMR-Gal4 serves as control. B GMR > Aβ42 adult eye is highly reduced due
  to neurodegeneration. C Gain-of-function of Mnat9 in the background of GMR > Aβ42
  (GMR > Aβ42+Mnat9) results in significant rescue in the adult eye as compared to
  the GMR > Aβ42 reduced eye phenotype. D However, downregulating Mnat9 levels in
  GMR > Aβ42 flies (GMR > Aβ42+Mnat9RNAi) enhances GMR > Aβ42 neurodegenerative phenotype.
  E GMR>hepAct and F GMR>junaspV7 results in a severe neurodegenerative phenotype
  in the eye. Whereas (G) GMR>bskDN and (H) GMR>puc, do not affect the size of the
  adult eye, serve as controls. I GMR > Aβ42 + hepAct and J GMR > Aβ42 + junaspV7
  results in a dramatic neurodegenerative eye phenotype in the adult fly. However,
  K GMR > Aβ42 + bskDN and L GMR > Aβ42 + puc results in a significant rescue as compared
  to GMR > Aβ42 adult eye. Gain-of-function of Mnat9 in the background of GMR > Aβ42
  resulted in a slight rescue when JNK signaling pathway was upregulated (M) GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9 + hepAct
  and (N) GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9 + junaspv7. Downregulation of the JNK pathway in (O)
  GMR > Aβ42+Mnat9+bskDN and (P) GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9 + puc showed a significant rescue
  eye phenotype. Q Loss-of-function of Mnat9 in the background of GMR > Aβ42 resulted
  in not eclosed flies with worsen eye phenotype when the JNK signaling pathway was
  upregulated: GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi + junaspv7. Downregulation of the JNK pathway
  in (R) GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi + bskDN and (S) GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi + puc showed
  a significant rescue eye phenotype as compared to GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi. T Quantitative
  analyses of area of the eye. The surface area of the eye (within white dotted line)
  was calculated using ImageJ. Five flies were used for calculating the eye surface
  area for each genotype (1. GMR-Gal4, 2. GMR > Aβ42, 3. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9, 4. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi,
  5. GMR > hepAct 6. GMR > Aβ42 + hepAct, 7. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9 + hepAct, 8. GMR > junaspV7,
  9. GMR > Aβ42+ junaspV7, 10. GMR > Aβ42+ Mnat9+ junaspV7, 11. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi + junaspV7,
  12. GMR > bskDN, 13. GMR > Aβ42 + bskDN, 14. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9 + bskDN, 15. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi + bskDN,
  16. GMR > puc, 17. GMR > Aβ42 + puc, 18. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9 + puc, 19. GMR > Aβ42 + Mnat9RNAi + puc).
  Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test for independent samples.
  Error bars show the standard error of mean (mean ± SEM), and symbols above the error
  bar signify as ***p-value < 0.001, **p-value < 0.01, *p-value < 0.05, and not significant
  (n.s.) p-value > 0.05 respectively. Scale bar = 100 μm.'
