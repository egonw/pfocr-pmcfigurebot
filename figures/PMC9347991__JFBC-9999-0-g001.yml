caption: EGCG inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation by boosting antioxidants
  and mitochondrial biogenesis via. SIRT1 activation. SIRT1 suppresses the transcription
  of several cytokine genes by directly regulating the NF‐κB pathway. The SIRT1 activator
  EGCG inhibits the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL‐1 by inhibiting the
  NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. The severe COVID‐19 infection leads to enhanced
  macrophage activity, that release high levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines resulting
  in cytokine storm. The EGCG suppresses the hyperinflammation and ROS production
  by upregulating SIRT1 to inhibit the production of these hyperinflammatory macrophages,
  inhibit the p38 MAPK pathway, and increase the levels of antioxidant enzymes SOD
  and CAT by deacetylating PGC1α and FOXO1 in the FOXO1‐induced signaling cascade.
  EGCG‐mediated SIRT1 activity can suppress the activation of the p53 protein that
  regulates pro‐apoptotic proteins BAX and PUMA which are induced during DNA damage
  by ROS. 3CLpro, 3C‐like protease; ACE2 Receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2;
