caption: Host mTOR activity associates with bacterial variables and host immune and
  barrier functions in the mucosal environmentConstruction of multi-omics meta-model
  for microbiome-to-host regulation of mTOR activity.(A) Latent variables were computed
  for each data stream (microbiome composition, bacterial proteins, and metabolites)
  using partial least-squares regression (PLSR) to predict mTOR score before integration
  via a generalized linear model with interaction effects.(B–E) The mTOR activity
  score was then regressed against (B) bacterial taxa, (C) bacterial proteins, (D) bacterial
  GO functions, and (E) metabolites measured in the vaginal fluid.(F) Multi-omics
  integration via latent variable interaction effects linear modeling identified top
  variables that associate with an activated mTOR pathway. The significant interactions
  between mTOR pathway and latent variables, bacterial composition LV1, and metabolome
  LV2 are shown here. Bacterial taxa positively associated with an activated mTOR
  score include Gardnerella, Prevotella amnii, and Mobiluncus mulieris. Vaginal metabolites
  associated with activated mTOR expression include 5-aminovalerate, N-acetylputrescine,
  imidazolepropionic acid, xanthine, and tyramine.See also B–S2D and ; .
