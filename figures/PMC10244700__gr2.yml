caption: 'Energy stress inhibits ferroptosis partly through AMPK/FoxO3a signaling
  pathway. Cells treated with or without erastin(16 μM) and cultured in normal or
  sugar-free medium for 24 h Then the protein levels of FoxO3a, p-FoxO3a(Ser413),
  AMPK and p-AMPK(Thr172) in (A/C)MEFs and (B/D)MCF-7 cells were determined by Western
  blot. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.0001 versus the Glc group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01,
  ###p < 0.001 versus the -Glc group. (E) MCF-7 cells were treated with compound C
  (2 μM) or erastin (16 μM) in normal and sugar-free medium for 36 h, then the cell
  viability was measured by CCK-8 kit. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (F) MCF-7 cells
  were transfected with FoxO3 specific siRNA for 24 h, the efficiency of knockdown
  was detected by western blotting analysis. 24 h after transfection with FoxO3a shRNA
  or Negative control (NC), MCF-7 cells were treated with 16 μM erastin (G) or 5 μM
  RSL3 (H) and cultured in normal or sugar-free medium for 24 h. Cell viability was
  measured by CCK-8 kit. **p < 0.01 versus NC group cultured in sugar-free medium,
  ##p < 0.01 versus the group cultured in sugar-free medium for (G) while ##p < 0.01
  versus the erastin group cultured in normal medium for(H)，aap < 0.01, aaap < 0.001
  versus the control group. (I/J) 24 h after transfection with lentivirus containing
  FoxO3a shRNA, MCF-7 cells were treated with erastin and cultured in normal or sugar-free
  medium for 24 h. Oxidized C11-BODIPY581/591 (Green) indicating lipid ROS were imaged
  by fluorescent microscope.*p＜0.05,**p＜0.01 versus NC; aap＜0.01,aaap＜0.001 versus
  the Glc group; #p＜0.05，##p＜0.01 versus the erastin group;@@p＜0.01 versus the -Glc
  group. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 3.'
