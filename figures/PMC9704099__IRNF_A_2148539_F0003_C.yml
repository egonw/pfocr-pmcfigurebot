caption: 'Localization and protein expression of NF-κB in renal tissue. (A) Immunofluorescence
  staining with paraffin sections, with NF-κB p65 shown in red and DAPI nuclear staining
  shown in blue (magnification 630×); (B-D) Protein expression of NF-κB p65 in rat
  kidney detected by Western blot analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6/group.
