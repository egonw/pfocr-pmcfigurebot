caption: Potentially targetable genetically altered pathways in advanced bladder cancer.
  Frequently mutated pathways in advanced bladder cancer include RTKs such as the
  FGFRs and ErbB receptor groups. Intracellular pathways include the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, chromatin remodeling, and DNA damage repair.
  Significant cross-talk exists between the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and RAS-MAPK pathways. Downstream
  effects of mTOR activation include cell cycle progression and cellular growth; downstream
  effects of MAPK activation include the regulation of translation, differentiation,
  and the cell cycle. Figure created with biorender.com (accessed on 22 February 2022).
