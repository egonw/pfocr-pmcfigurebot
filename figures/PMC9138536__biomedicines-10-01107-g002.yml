caption: Depicting systematic immune response in PTSD. The immune signaling pathway
  is dysregulated in PTSD at multiple regulatory levels. Recent whole genome analysis
  in PTSD conducted on both human and animal models of PTSD have demonstrated that
  epigenomic and transcriptomic changes may mediate the development, maintenance,
  and clinical presentation of PTSD. HPA axis releasing ACHT stimulates cortisol (human
  (GC) glucocorticoids) production which, in turn, also mediates gene expression and
  exacerbates immune response in the periphery and brain. In this review, 84 genes
  that participate in immune signaling processes were commonly reported as differentially
  expressed or methylated genes in central (brain) and peripheral (such as blood and
  saliva) tissues across species. ~50% of those convergent genes correspond to brain-cell
  type specific markers such as astrocytes and microglia, which are discriminated
  by color. Upon inflammatory response, the blood brain barrier (BBB) may be affected
  and allow a higher migration of molecules crossing the brain and periphery. Thus,
  based on the literature review, we propose the existence of common regulatory markers
  able to cross BBB, impact the expression of those 84 convergent genes and orchestrate
  systemic immune dysregulation in PTSD through important immunological pathways such
  as cytokine-cytokine interaction, TNF and NF-κB/JAK/STAT signaling. These common
  regulatory markers may correspond to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  which are released from damaged cells and activate the innate immune response. By
  using drug repurposing analysis, we also suggest that Th17 differentiation may be
  a possible target mechanism for drug action, as well as Toll-like receptor signaling
  and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, for the treatment of PTSD.
