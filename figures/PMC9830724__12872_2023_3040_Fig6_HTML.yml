caption: 'Knockdown of NLRP3 reversed the influence of UA on apoptosis and cell cycle
  in AC16 and HAEC cell lines. A Cell apoptosis was measured after different treatments;
  B Cell cycle of AC16 cell line was measured after different treatments; C Cell cycle
  of HAEC cell line was measured after different treatments. *P < 0.05 compared with
  the group control. #P < 0.05 compared with the group UA'
