caption: 'Effects of zearalenone (ZEA) on gene expression of porcine endometrial stromal
  cells (A) The effect of ZEA on ASK1 mRNA expression; (B) Effect of ZEA on CHOP mRNA
  expression; (C) Effect of ZEA on GRP78 mRNA expression; (D) Effect of ZEA on HSP70
  mRNA expression; (E) Effect of ZEA on PERK mRNA expression; (F) Effect of ZEA on
  the Bax/BCL2 mRNA expression ratio; (G) Effect of ZEA on CASP3 mRNA expression;
  (H) Effect of ZEA on CASP9 mRNA expression; (I) Effect of ZEA on JNK mRNA expression.
  CON, control; ZEA, cells treated with 15 μM ZEA; P + Z, cells treated with ZEA and
  4-Phenylbutyrate (4-PBA). Treatment time: 24 h. “**” represents a significant difference
  compared with the control group, “##” indicates a significant difference compared
  with the ZEA group.'
