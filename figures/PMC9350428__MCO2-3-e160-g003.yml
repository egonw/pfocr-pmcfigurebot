caption: PEMF promotes the expression levels of BDNF and VEGF in BMMSCs in vitro through
  Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. (A) Representative immunofluorescence images of
  BMMSCs that were stained for BDNF, NGF, VEGF, and Ki67 (scale bar = 20 μm). (B)
  The protein levels of BDNF, NGF, and VEGF were analyzed by western blotting. (C)
  Quantification of the relative expression levels of BDNF, NGF, and VEGF. PEMF 3d
  group displayed highest expression levels of BDNF among all groups. VEGF was significantly
  increased in the PEMF 3d group compared with other groups. (D) The protein levels
  of β‐catenin were analyzed by western blotting. (E) Quantification of the relative
  expression levels of β‐catenin showed PEMF 3d significantly increased the expression
  of β‐catenin compared with control group. (F) Co‐IP analysis showed the enhanced
  interaction between LRP6 and Frizzled5 after PEMF intervention in 293T cells. (G)
  Representative immunofluorescence images of β‐catenin (red), phalloidine (green),
  and DAPI (blue) in BMMSCs for all groups. Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor (IWR‐1)
  significantly inhibited the expression of β‐catenin (scale bar = 20 μm). (H) Wnt
  signaling pathway inhibitor (IWR‐1) successfully inhibited the expression of β‐catenin.
  (I) Quantification of the expression levels of β‐catenin. (J) The protein levels
  of BDNF and VEGF were analyzed by western blotting. (K) The effect of PEMF on the
  expression of BDNF and VEGF in BMMSCs was partially abolished by a Wnt signaling
  pathway inhibitor (IWR‐1). (Error bars show mean ± SD; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
