caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic pathway related to rhubarb anthraquinone treated
  rat acute liver injury. The boxes bordered in red represent metabolites that are
  significantly higher in NC, RA-L, RA-M and RA-H than in ALI, respectively. The light
  blue boxes indicate metabolites significantly higher in ALI than in NC, RA-L, RA-M
  and RA-H respectively.
