caption: Chromosome 20 open reading frame 24 (C20orf24) exerts oncogenic activities
  in vivo and in vitro through the mitogen‑activated protein kinase/extracellular
  signal‐regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signalling pathway. (A) Colony formation assays
  were performed to determine the ability of HCT116 and HT29 cells to form colonies
  by manipulating C20orf24 expression. Scale bar, 5 mm. (B) Images of the tumours
  and growth curves of the subcutaneous tumours formed by C20orf24‐knockdown HCT116
  cells (n = 6). (C) Immunostaining of Ki‐67 and quantification of the proliferation
  index in the tumours; scale bar, 50 μm. Bars, SD; *, p < .05; **, p < .01, ***,
  p < .001. (D, E) Stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)‐based
  quantitative proteomics identified MAPK/ERK signalling pathways activated by C20orf24.
  (D) C20orf24‐regulated proteins using SILAC‐based proteomics. Differentially expressed
  proteins in C20orf24‐overexpression HCT116 cells are represented by a volcano plot.
  (E) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) suggested that the MAPK/ERK pathways are involved
  in the functional role of C20orf24 in CRC progression. (F, G) The expression levels
  of p‐ERK and p‐MEK were compared in HCT116 and HT29 cells with C20orf24 overexpression
  or knockdown by Western blotting, and actin was used as a loading control. The experiment
  was performed in culture medium containing 2% serum. Bars, SD; *, p < .05; **, p < .01,
  ***, p < .001
