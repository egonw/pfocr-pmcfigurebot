caption: SPX-induced adipose browning is mediated through JAK2 and STAT3 signaling.
  (A, B) RNA sequence of the possible involved signaling pathways. (C, D) The expression
  of P-JAK2/JAK2 and P-STAT3/STAT3 in 3T3-L1 mature adipocyte. (E, F) The expression
  of P-JAK2/JAK2 and P-STAT3/STAT3 in WAT of mice. All values are represented as means
  with error bars representing S.D. In the bar graph, *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. n = 6
  for each group
