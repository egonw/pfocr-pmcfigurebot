caption: lncRNA HHIP-AS1 and HHIP are continuously down-regulated during osteogenic
  differentiation of BM-MSCs. Up-regulated or down-regulated (A) lncRNAs and (B) mRNAs
  were analyzed by Venn diagram during osteogenic differentiation at days 0, 7 and
  14 of osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. Heatmap of (C) lncRNA and (D) mRNA
  changes at days 0, 7 and 14 of osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. (E) FISH showing
  that lncRNA HHIP-AS1 was expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of BM-MSCs at day
  7 of osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. mRNA expression level of (F) lncRNA
  HHIP-AS1 and (G) HHIP during osteogenic differentiation. (H) Protein expression
  level of HHIP, RUNX2, and osteocalcin during osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs.
  The histogram data for each group are the average of three independent replicates;
  bars represent standard deviation; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; Scale bar
  = 10 Î¼m.
