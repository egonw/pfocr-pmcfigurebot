caption: Regulation of AGB1 in primary metabolisms upon HN treatment. A, Venn diagram
  and table representing the overlap of DEGs responding to HN with other abiotic stresses.
  G×E and genotypic deviation DEGs were obtained based on the linear model of G×E.
  Abiotic stress DEGs refer to the genes identified from meta-analysis in . G1–G10
  in the table are groups of G×E DEGs as clustered using fuzzy c-means. B, Gene expression
  patterns of DEGs in G1–G10. Expression changes in y-axis represent Z-score of log2-normalized
  read counts of DEGs. Line graphs represent expression patterns of each individual
  gene. Line colors represent membership values that range from 0 to 1, indicating
  the score of gene belonging to each cluster core (G1–G10). DEGs with membership
  value ≥ 0.9, 0.7, and 0.5 are designated as pink, dark blue, and light blue, respectively.
  Green lines represent DEGs with membership value < 0.5. G1, G2, G4, G7, and G9 in
  orange represent either up-regulated in agb1-2 or down-regulated in Col-0 by HN.
  G3, G5, G6, G8, and G10 in black represent either up-regulated in Col-0 or down-regulated
  in agb1-2 by HN. C, GO enrichment analysis of DEGs belonging to HN-specific response
  of each gene group. The color scale represents –log10(FDR). GO names in green indicate
  GO terms related to primary metabolism, particularly in amino acids. D, Expression
  of metabolism-related genes. DEGs involved in cellular metabolisms were categorized
  by AraCYC. Bar graphs represent the average Z-score of log2 normalized read counts
  of genes in each category. Letters above bars indicate statistical differences among
  each metabolic category by one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey HSD test with adjusted
  P-value < 0.05. “Sec metab” is secondary metabolite. “Syn” is biosynthesis. Nucleo
  is nucleoside and nucleotide. “Metab Reg” is the metabolic regulator. “FA/Lip” is
  fatty acid and Lipid. “Cofactor Syn” is cofactor, carrier, and vitamin biosynthesis.
  “Cell Str” is cell structure. “Carbo” is carbohydrate. “Aromatic” is aromatic compound.
  “AA” is amino acid. “Amine” is amine and polyamine. “Alcohol” is alcohol. “Cofactor
  Deg” is cofactor, prosthetic group, electron carrier degradation. “TCA” is tricarboxylic
  acid. “Photosyn” is photosynthesis light reactions. “PPP” is the pentose phosphate
  pathway. “Ferment” is fermentation. “Autotrop CO2 Fix” is Autotrophic CO2 Fixation.
  “Aerob Resp” is aerobic respiration. “Macromol Mod” is macromolecule modification.
  “Inorganic Nutr” is inorganic nutrient metabolism. “Detox” is detoxification. “C1
  Comp Util/Assimil” is C1 compound utilization and assimilation. “Act/Inact/Interconvers”
  is activation/inactivation/interconversion.
