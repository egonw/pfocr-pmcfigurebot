caption: 'BDNF signaling pathways. BDNF is translated as its isoform, preproBDNF.
  In the Golgi apparatus, preproBDNF is cleaved, which produces proBDNF. ProBDNF might
  be split into pro-BDNF peptide and mature BDNF intracellularly (with furin or convertases)
  or extracellularly (with plasmin, MMP2, or MMP9). ProBDNF is metabolically active;
  it binds to the p75NTR receptor with high affinity, which might cause apoptosis
  or promote synaptic elimination. Activation of TrkB might result in the stimulation
  of angiogenesis and neuroprotection, as well as promoting cell survival. Both receptors
  modulate the synaptic strength, which allows for the regulation of synaptic plasticity.
  BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid; Glu: glutamate;
  mRNA: messenger RNA; MMP2/9: metalloproteinase 2/9; NO: nitric oxide; p75NTR: p75
  neurotrophin receptor-mediated signaling pathway; TrKb: tropomyosin-related kinase.'
