caption: 'Zymosan A-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells into draining pLNs
  (VH: control group injected zymosan A only) and the effect on pLN reduction by the
  compounds. The anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone was employed as a positive control.
  Samples were administered by IP from day 0 to day 6. On day 7, pLNs were isolated
  and weighed. ** p < 0.01 compared with the group treated with the LPS alone. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD.'
