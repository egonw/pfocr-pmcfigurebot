caption: Metabolic pathways enriched by the metabolic features present in both plasma
  and saliva by the C18 column. The cells are shaded according to strength of association
  (i.e., p value) between each of the metabolic pathways and significant features
  that were associated with each indoor/outdoor single traffic pollutant indicator.
  Pathways are ordered according to the total number of the significant pathway-traffic
  pollutant pairs (p < 0.05) in the C18 column. Each pathway is enriched by at least
  three significant annotated overlapping features by either plasma or saliva.
