caption: 'Butein attenuates mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction
  in H2O2-treated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Mitochondrial ROS production was measured
  by MitoSox staining assay (a) and red fluorescence intensity (b) using cells treated
  with butein and/or H2O2. (c) Western blot analysis for the expression levels of
  mitochondrial complex II and β-actin (loading control) in butein-pretreated/H2O2-treated
  cells. (d) The band densities of the ratio of mitochondrial complex II protein were
  calculated with HD imaging software. The results are shown as the mean ± SEM in
  triplicate. ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 vs. control group. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. H2O2-only group. Cont; control, Bu; butein. Complex
  II; mitochondrial complex II. Scale bar, 100 μm.'
