caption: CPNE8 expression could predict the clinical benefit of ICB. (A) Correlation
  of CPNE8 expression and immune infiltrating cells quantified using the MCP-counter
  algorithm in the TCGA-STAD cohort. (B) Correlation between ssGSEA scores of 29 immune
  cells and CPNE8 expression in gastric cancer. (C) The heatmap showed the correlation
  between CPNE8 expression and immune checkpoint genes. G1 represented the CPNE8 high
  expression group; G2 represented the CPNE8 low expression group. (D) Increased CPNE8
  expression was associated with higher immune dysfunction scores. (E) The mRNA expression
  of CPNE8 was positively correlated with the TIDE score. (F) The rate of immune checkpoint
  blockade responses in GC patients was predicted by the TIDE algorithm in the high
  or low CPNE8 groups.
