caption: 'The signaling pathways involved in LINC00665. In human cancers, LINC00665
  is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, TGF-β signaling
  pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling
  pathway. *: In triple-negative breast cancer, the micropeptide CIP2A-BP encoded
  by LINC00665 can inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the
  migration and invasion of tumor cells. ↑, Promotion; ↓, Inhibition.'
