caption: CIRP silencing leads to downregulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (a–c)
  The mRNA of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1. (d) The protein level of Nrf2 and HO-1. (e) Representative
  images of Nrf2 localization by using immunofluorescence staining. HEK293T cells
  were transfected with pAAV-CIRP vector or pAAV-SaiRNA vector as a control for 3
  days; then, these cells were subjected to RT-qPCR analysis or western blot analysis
  or immunofluorescence staining. The statistical data were presented as mean ± SD
  from at least three independent experiments, n ≥ 3; ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
