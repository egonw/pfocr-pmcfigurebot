caption: Statistical analysis of thickness (n=30) of upper epidermis, lower epidermis,
  palisade tissue, sponge tissue, leaf and mesophyll cell of asexually propagated
  second generation transgenic plants. Data are means ± SE of 30 biological replicates.
  Different letters indicate statistically significant differences between genotypes
  as determined by ANOVA using Tukey-Kramer posthoc test (P < 0.05). (A) Thickness
  of upper leaf epidermis of transgenic and wild type. (B) Thickness of lower leaf
  epidermis of transgenic and wild type. (C) Thickness of palisade tissue of transgenic
  and wild type. (D) Thickness of sponge tissue of transgenic and wild type. (E) Thickness
  of leaf of transgenic and wild type. (F) Thickness of mesophyll of transgenic and
  wild type.
article_title: The appropriate expression and coordination of glycolate oxidase and
  catalase are vital to the successful construction of the photorespiratory metabolic
  pathway.
