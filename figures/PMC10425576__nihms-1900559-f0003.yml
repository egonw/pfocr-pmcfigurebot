figure_title: Shared regulatory architecture of rSNPs by sex, cell type, and sex-interacting
  SNP type
caption: (A) TFs with binding motif disruptions by â‰¥ 4 nominally significant (empirical
  p < 0.05) rSNPs or sex-interacting rSNPs, enriched relative to nonfunctional SNPs.
  Number of rSNPs associated to a given binding site are shown. (B) Terms from Enrichr
  () analysis, identifying shared upstream regulators (TFs controlling expression
  of several of the TFs in panel A), brain regions enriched for expression of the
  rSNP-enriched TFs, protein interactors enriched among rSNP-enriched TFs, and MSigDB
  pathway term enrichment for rSNP-enriched TF sets. Bolded enrichments are discussed
  in the text.
