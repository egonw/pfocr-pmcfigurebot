caption: Ex vivo evaluating the role of CXCR4 knockdown in improving PTX chemosensitivity
  through reduction of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling, EMT- and CSC-related protein expressions.
  CXCR4, EMT-and CSC-related protein expressions, as well as PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling
  pathway in both OVCA420 (A) and SKOV3 (C) cells derived from the tumour xenograft
  model were analysed by WB using the indicated antibody against each protein examined.
  Band density ratios of p-Akt to Akt, and CXCR4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin
  and snail, CD44, CD133 and NANOG to β-actin were determined by densitometry analysis,
  respectively (B, D). Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments
  with triplicated wells for each condition. Asterisk indicates P< 0.05 compared with
  the control as determined by t test.
