caption: p53 status affects the inhibition of cell growth through Citrus limon L.-derived
  nanovesicle treatment. (A) HCT116 WT, HCT-15, and SW480 cells were treated with
  the indicated concentrations of C. limon L.-derived nanovesicles for 72 h. (B,C)
  HCT116 WT or HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
  of C. limon L.-derived nanovesicles for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell growth was measured
  using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Data are means ± standard error measurement;
  n = 3; * p < 0.05, relative to HCT116 WT. p values were calculated using Dunnett’s
  multiple comparisons test and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test.
