caption: Pan-caner pathway dysregulation in different KEGG categories. (a) The significantly
  dysregulated pathways among most cancer types in different KEGG categories. (b)
  Heatmap of 85 metabolic pathways dysregulation in pan-cancer. The red colour represent
  that the pathway is up-regulated in the cancer samples, while blue colour is down-regulated.
  The intensity of colour indicates the magnitude of dysregulation.
