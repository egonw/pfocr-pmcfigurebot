figure_title: ALOX15 is required for AM maintenance
caption: a, Representative FACS plots (left) and quantification (right) of AM numbers
  (gated on single live cells, CD45.2+CD11c+Siglec-F+) in the lungs of adult WT (n = 7)
  and Alox15−/− (n = 6) mice. b, AM numbers in BAL (n = 9 mice per group). c, Quantification
  of the AM population in the lungs of BM chimeras 8 weeks after reconstitution (left
  to right, n = 5, 5, 8, 11, 11, 9 and 5 mice per group, respectively). d, Model of
  AM development. e–g, Numbers of fetal monocytes (e), pre-AMs (f) and AMs (g) in
  WT and Alox15−/− lungs at various ages (n = 6 (PND0) or 8 (PND1 and PND3) per group).
  h, Top upregulated and downregulated pathways from KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis.
  i, Violin plot (left) and heatmap (right) of mRNA transcripts significantly upregulated
  and downregulated in the cell cycle pathway (n = 3 (WT) or 4 (Alox15−/−)). Data
  are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. and are from one experiment (h,i) or pooled from
  two (a,c,e–g) or three (b) independent experiments. Data were analysed using unpaired
  two-tailed t-test (a,b), Mann–Whitney two-tailed test (i) or one-way analysis of
  variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (c). The model in
  d was created using BioRender (https://biorender.com).
