caption: 'RARRES1, RARRES2, and DKK1 expression levels by HFLS and HFLS-OA stimulated
  with TNFα or LPS measured using the ELISA method. Expression of proteases measured
  in cellular lysates using the ELISA method. Cells were stimulated for 24 h with
  10 ng/mL of TNFα (A,C,E) or LPS (B,D,F). Afterward, the proteins were isolated,
  and RARRES1 (A,B), RARRES1 (C,D), and DKK1 (E,F) levels were determined. Data were
  calculated as % of control ± SEM and analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
  post hoc test. * p < 0.05; ** 0.01 > p > 0.001; vs. control group. # p < 0.05; ##
  0.01 > p > 0.001; ### p < 0.001 HFLS vs. HFLS-OA stimulated groups. HFLS, human
  fibroblast-like synoviocytes; HFLS-OA, osteoarthritic human fibroblast-like synoviocytes;
  TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ELISA, enzyme linked
  immunosorbent assay; RARRES1, retinoic acid receptor responder 1; RARRES2, retinoic
  acid receptor responder 2; DKK1, dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1.'
