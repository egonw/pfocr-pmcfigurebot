caption: 'Inflammatory bowel disease patient telemedicine pathway. Based on the current
  evidence, various telemedicine applications are across the entire inflammatory bowel
  diseases management, from diagnosis to treatment setting and short-term and long-term
  monitoring of its effectiveness. Nevertheless, such telehealth applications are
  bidirectional. That is, they may have the potential to be both active (provided
  by the physician, psychologist, nurse or nutritionist, etc.) and passively requested
  by the patient from their healthcare managers on needs. IBD: Inflammatory bowel
  diseases.'
