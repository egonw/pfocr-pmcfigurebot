caption: RSL3-mediated transcriptomic changes. Analysis of the transcriptomic changes
  induced by RSL3 treatment in G361-shCTR and G361-shCYGB cells compared to the untreated
  control. (A,B) fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fGSEA) using the hallmark pathway
  gene sets was performed on G361-shCTR (A) and G361-shCYGB (B) melanoma cells. Gene
  ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed on the significantly differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in G361-shCTR (C) and G361-shCYGB (D) cells.
