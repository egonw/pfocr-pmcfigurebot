caption: ProBDNF/p75NTRsignaling in SLE B cells. ProBDNF/p75NTRsignaling promotes
  B cell differentiation, proliferation, release of proinflammatory cytokines and
  autoantibody production and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly. Mitochondria
  damage and dysfunction including decreased mitochondria membrane potential and enhanced
  OXPHOS and mitochondria mass, which may increase disease activity through inhibiting
  plasmablast differentiation by proBDNF/p75NTRsignaling pathway.
