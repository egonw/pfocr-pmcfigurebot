caption: Detection of TGF‐β/Smad signaling pathway in the brain of the mice. (a) Immunohistochemistry
  images of TGF‐β, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 expression in paraffin sections of the
  brain tissues of WT and Mut mice. (b) Average optical density of the immunohistochemical
  images analyzed by ImageJ software. Black and white represent the relative protein
  expression levels of TGF‐β, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 in the brains of WT and Mut
  mice, respectively. The expression levels of TGF‐β and Smad2 between the two groups
  were significantly different (p < .01), the expression of Smad3 was different between
  the two groups (p < .05), and the expression of Smad4 was not different between
  the two groups (p > .05). (c) Compared with WT mice, the mRNA expression levels
  of TGF‐β in the brain of Mut mice extremely significantly increased (p < .001),
  the mRNA expression levels of Smad2 and Smad3 significantly increased (p < .01),
  and the mRNA expression levels of Smad4 were not significantly different between
  the two groups (p > .05). (d) The protein expression levels of TGF‐β and Smad2 in
  Mut mice significantly increased compared with those in WT mice (p < .01), the protein
  expression level of Smad3 increased compared with the control group (p < .05), and
  no significant difference was observed in the protein expression level of Smad4
  between the two groups (p > .05)
