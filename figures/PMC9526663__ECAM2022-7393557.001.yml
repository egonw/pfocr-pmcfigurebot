caption: 'Protective effects of Ukgansan against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in differentiated
  PC12 cells. Differentiated PC12 cells were treated with Ukgansan for 1 h and MPP+
  for 23 h and then the cell viability was measured using the CCK-8 assay. (a) The
  effect of Ukgansan on MPP+-induced programmed apoptosis signaling. Its factors (cleaved
  caspase-3) were measured by ELISA kits. (b) Values are given as the mean ± S.E.M.
  ∗∗∗p < 0.001 compared to the control group, and ###p < 0.001 compared to the MPP+-toxicity
  group.'
