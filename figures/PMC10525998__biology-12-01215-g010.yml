caption: A model for the light entrainment mechanism of the circadian clock of Nasonia.
  Light is perceived by the rhodopsin photoreceptor cells (including blue, green,
  and ocellary red photoreceptor classes). The information is transmitted to clock
  neurons through neurotransmittersâ€”possibly glutamate and/or GABA. This neurotransmission
  regulates glutamate receptors, NMDA receptors, and/or GABA receptors and potentially
  cause the influx of glutamate, GABA, and Ca2+. This neuronal signaling then activates
  the CREB/CRE signaling pathway and AP-1 signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation
  of cry2 and npas2 gene expression. npas2 may also contribute to the upregulation
  of cry2 expression. Eventually, upregulation of cry2 results in CRY2/PER heterodimerization
  and resets the clock by inhibiting CLK-/CYC-controlled gene expression.
