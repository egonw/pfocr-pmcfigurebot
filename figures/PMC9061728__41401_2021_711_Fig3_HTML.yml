figure_title: 15d-PGJ2-induced TFEB activation is independent of PPARγ, mTOR inactivation,
  and calcium-dependent calcineurin signaling
caption: a PPARγ antagonist GW9662 does not block 15d-PGJ2-induced TFEB activation.
  After pretreatment of CF-7 cells with PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (10 µM) for 30 min
  followed by adding 15d-PGJ2 into cells for another 12 h, the cytoplasm and the nuclear
  distribution of TFEB were detected by immunostaining. b 15d-PGJ2 does not inhibit
  the mTOR signaling pathway. After cells were treated with 15d-PGJ2 (30 µM) for indicated
  durations, the expression of p-p70S6K /P70S6K, p-4EBP1/4EBP1, p-TFEB142, p-TFEB
  211 were detected by Western blotting; Torin 1 (250 nm) was used as a positive control.
  c Calcium chelator BAPTA-AM or calcineurin inhibitor FK506 does not inhibit 15-dPGJ2-induced
  TFEB activation. After pretreatment of CF-7 cells with BAPTA-AM (20 µM) or calcineurin
  inhibitor FK506 (10 µM) for 30 min followed by adding 15d-PGJ2 into cells for another
  12 h, the cytoplasm and the nucleus distribution of TFEB were detected by immunostaining.
  d PP2A inhibitor OA (okadaic acid) does not inhibit 15-dPGJ2-induced TFEB activation.
  After pretreatment of CF-7 cells with OA (400 nM) for 30 min followed by adding
  15d-PGJ2 into cells for another 12 h, the cytoplasm and the nucleus distribution
  of TFEB was detected by immunostaining. Representative data are shown from three
  independent experiments. Scale bar 15 µm. ns no significance.
