caption: 'ACVR2B/Fc prevented the PDAC‐induced dysregulation of many atrophy‐associated
  pathways in males but caused fewer changes in females. Comparison of enriched pathways:
  Column 1, male KPC vs. male controls; 2, female KPC vs. female controls; 3, male
  ACVR2B/Fc (2B) treated KPC vs. vehicle treated KPC (V); 4, female ACVR2B/fc (2B)
  treated KPC vs. vehicle treated KPC (V). Cut‐off for pathway enrichment analysis:
  |Z| ≥ 2 and P < 0.05. Dots, |Z| < 2. The pathways were sorted based on the male
  KPC vs. control; the most activated pathway is on the top and the most inhibited
  pathway is on the bottom in this group.'
