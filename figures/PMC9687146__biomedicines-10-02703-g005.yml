caption: In normal conditions, GRP78 is mainly located in the ER or mitochondria and
  controls ER homeostasis. It balances the survival of the cells by regulating cell
  cycle progression through the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such
  as p21. GRP78 interacts with PERK, IRE1, and ATR6 in an unstressed environment and
  dislocates from these UPR sensors during cellular stress. Cisplatin induces cellular
  senescence via the DNA damage mechanism via p53 and p21 activation. According to
  stress stimuli, GRP78 shifts from ER residence to the cell surface membrane, where
  it is anchored with MTJ1/HTJ1. Signal transduction from cell surface GRP78 can trigger
  the Akt signaling pathway, resulting in the upregulation of self-renewal transcription
  factors, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2. Moreover, the cells which undergo cellular senescence
  demonstrate higher expression of stemness markers CD133 and CD44.
