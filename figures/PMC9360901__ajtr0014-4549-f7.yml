caption: 'Clinical significance of UBE2L3/GSK-3β/Snail crosstalk in LUAD and schematic
  diagram. A. Representative immunohistochemical images of LUAD specimens stained
  with UBE2L3, GSK-3β, Snail, or E-cadherin antibodies. Magnification: 200× (scar
  bar =50 μm). B. Quantification of the immunohistochemistry analyses. Chi-square
  test was used to analyze the relationship between UBE2L3 and Snail, GSK-3β, or E-cadherin.
  **P<0.01; *P<0.05. C. The schematic diagram shows that UBE2L3 promotes LUAD cell
  migration and invasion by inducing EMT through the GSK-3β/Snail axis.'
article_title: UBE2L3 promotes lung adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis through
  the GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway.
