caption: Proteomics analysis of the early and late passages of BMR cells. (a) The
  bar graph illustrates the pathway enrichment visualization process overrepresented
  in the related pathways in late passage cells compared to early passage cells with
  a normalized enrichment score. (b) A dot plot representation of the KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis shows the activated and suppressed biological processes in late
  passage cells compared to early passage cells. The dot size is based on the gene
  count enriched in the pathway, and the color of the dot shows the pathway enrichment
  significance. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) were performed with multiple
  test corrections (Benjamini–Hochberg). (c) The Cnet plot of the BMR proteomics analysis
  is shown. Each line shows the pathway and gene association. The fold changes of
  proteins are colored between red and blue. The gene ratios of the pathways are presented
  as the size of a circle. Pathways were selected as statistically significant at
  the p < 0.05 cutoff (n = 4).
