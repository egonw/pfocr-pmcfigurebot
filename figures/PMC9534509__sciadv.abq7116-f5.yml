figure_title: Regulation of ADCY9/cAMP/PKA signaling activated by the scaffolds on
  BMSCs osteogenic differentiation
caption: (A) Schematic of the scaffolds cultured with BMSCs treated by PAK inhibitor
  H89 or ADCY inhibitor SQ22536 for 3 days. (B) Western blot analysis of ADCY9, PKA,
  MEK/p-MEK, ERK/p-ERK, ALP, and β-actin and (C to G) the corresponding quantitative
  analysis of band intensities. (H) Relative expression of cAMP in BMSCs as assessed
  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (error bars, means ± SD; n = 3 per group;
  all analyses were done using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.

  with osteoinductivity by activating cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.
