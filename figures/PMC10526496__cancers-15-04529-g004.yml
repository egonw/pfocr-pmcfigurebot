caption: DPP-4 suppression promotes breast cancer survival by autophagic induction.
  (A). Western blot analysis of caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 in MCF 10A, MCF7,
  MDA-MB-231, and 4T1 cells treated with KR62436 (KR, 50 μM), 3-methyladenine (3-MA,
  5 mM), or KR and 3-MA for 48 h. Densitometric analysis of cleaved caspase-3 levels
  relative to caspase-3 levels (n = 3 per group). (B). Rate of early apoptosis as
  indicated by staining in MCF 10A, MDA-MB-231, and 4T1 cells treated with KR (50
  μM) and/or 3-MA (5 mM) for 48 h. The rates of early apoptosis were evaluated using
  annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. The cells labeled
  with annexin V+ and PI−, which are shown in the flamed area, were detected as the
  cells in the early apoptotic process (n = 3 per group). The data in the graph are
  presented as the mean ± SEM. NS, not significant.
