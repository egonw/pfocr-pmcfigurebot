caption: Ap-specific regulation of Imp-L2 is acetate independent, which is mediated
  by host steroid signaling. a–c Supplementation of acetate in the culture of larvae
  advances the timing of pupariation (a) and increases the activity of the Imd pathway,
  as measured by Diptericin expression (b), but fails to decrease Imp-L2 expression
  (c). d Blocking of ecdysone signaling by knockdown of the ecdysone receptor (EcR)
  diminishes the regulation of Imp-L2 expression by Ap (DM001). e Suggested relationships
  among Ap, Lp, and Imp-L2 uncovered in our study (see text). * p < 0.05 (t-test).
