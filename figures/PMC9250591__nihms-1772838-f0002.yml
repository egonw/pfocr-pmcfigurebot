figure_title: Hhip is expressed exclusively in non-taste papillae
caption: (A-A’’) H&E staining of FP bracketed with FILIF (A, sagittal section), CV
  (A’, horizontal section), and FOL (A’’, horizontal section) in Control tongue to
  illustrate tissue morphology. The taste bud is indicated by an oval in the FP (A)
  and arrows in CV (A’) and FOL (A’’). (B-B’’) X-Gal staining (blue) in HhiplacZ tongue
  sections indicates expression in FILIF only and not in FP (B), CV (B’) or FOL (B’’).
  (C-C’’) Immunostaining of HHIP (red) and taste bud cells (K8, green) in Control
  tongue demonstrates protein expression only in FILIF (C, arrow heads) similar to
  Hhip. Arrows mark taste buds in CV (C’) and FOL (C’’). Dotted lines outline the
  epithelium. Scale bars in A-A’’ apply to corresponding images in B-B’’ and C-C’’.
  Asterisk in C denotes non-specific surface staining.
