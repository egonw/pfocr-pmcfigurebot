caption: Effects of ATF6α on the AA metabolic pathway. (A,B) The production of AA
  (A) and PGE2 (B) was measured in LNCaP‐AI cells with or without ATF6α knockdown
  and PLA2G4A overexpression. (C,D) With RSL3 (2 μM) or ATF6α overexpression, cell
  death was measured in LNCaP‐AI cells with or without PLA2G4A knockdown. AA, arachidonic
  acid;  ATF6α, activating transcription factor 6 α; PGE2, prostaglandin E2. **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, determined by two‐tailed Student's t test
article_title: ATF6α promotes prostate cancer progression by enhancing PLA2G4A‐mediated
  arachidonic acid metabolism and protecting tumor cells against ferroptosis.
