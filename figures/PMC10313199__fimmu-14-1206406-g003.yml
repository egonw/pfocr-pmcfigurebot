caption: Acetylation signaling pathway in regulating autophagy activation of pulmonary
  hypertension. Acetylation modifications can modulate the activity of autophagy,
  thereby exerting a protective effect against pulmonary hypertension. In addition,
  various drugs can also be used to treat pulmonary hypertension by modifying acetylation
  modifications. However, further research is needed on the specific mechanism and
  effect of acetylation modification in pulmonary hypertension.
