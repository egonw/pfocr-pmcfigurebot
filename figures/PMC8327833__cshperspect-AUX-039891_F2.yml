caption: Schematic model of nontranscriptional auxin signaling at the cellular level.
  (A) Auxin entering the cell by influx or diffusion activates the TIR1/AFB receptors
  in the nucleus or possibly in the cytoplasm. Further, these receptors activate Ca2+
  and H+ fluxes at the plasma membrane (PM) via an unknown signaling branch and lead
  to root growth inhibition. (B) Auxin activates ROPs (Rho of plants) by unknown mechanism(s),
  possibly via the TMK1 receptor. Lipid composition and organization of the membrane
  play a key role (magenta triangles). Activation by cytoplasmic auxin has not been
  excluded (C). Activated ROPs trigger downstream events including changes in PIN
  endomembrane trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, and activation of the TOR
  (target of rapamycin) pathway.
