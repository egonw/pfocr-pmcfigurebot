caption: 'Redox signaling pathways involved in GIB/BBB integrity and inflammasome
  activation in MS. Gut dysbiosis, irrespective of its cause, leads to: (1) increased
  ROS/RNS concentration; (2) dysregulation of the Nrf2/Keap1 protective pathway; (3)
  decreased expression of Nrf2/ARE transcription factors, which leads to activation
  of the NFkB pathway, in turn promoting gut inflammation and leading to GIB disruption;
  (4) GIB disruption increases the permeability to small active compounds released
  by gut bacteria and makes it easier for bacteria to invade by lowering the local
  immune defense; (5) active gut microbiota metabolites trigger the BBB disruption
  and increase ROS/RNS and pro-inflammatory molecule levels through inhibition of
  Nrf2; and (6) increased ROS levels in the brain induce mitochondrial disfunction
  and inflammasome activation.'
