caption: BDX-01 supplementation alleviated mouse DSS-induced colitis following antibiotic
  treatment. (A) Mice were administered antibiotics for 4 days to deplete the gut
  microbiota before DSS treatment. The Abx + DSS and Abx + BDX-01 + DSS groups were
  administered 100 μL culture medium and 100 μL of 1 × 109 CFU culture of BDX-01 by
  gavage for 15 days, respectively. (B) Body weight change, (C) disease activity index
  score, (D) representative images of colon and (E) colon length, (F) representative
  microscopic images of HE-stained sections (100×), and (G) histopathology score.
  (H) Fecal BSH activity. (I) FXR, FGF15, NLRP3, and IL-1β expression determined using
  western blotting analysis. Data are mean ± SD (n = 3–5). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001 (unpaired t-tests, Kruskal–Wallis test, and one-way
  ANOVA, followed by post hoc test).
