caption: 'Effects of E. daniellii extract on migration of human keratinocytes. (A–D)
  HaCaT keratinocytes were treated with vehicle (0.1% [v/v] DMSO), E. daniellii extract
  (1, 5 μg/mL), or VPA (100 μM) for 24 h. (A,B) The in vitro wound-healing and transwell
  assays were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. (A) Representative
  images of in vitro wound-healing assay (upper) and quantitative measurement of relative
  wound-closure rate (lower). (B) Representative images of transwell assay and quantitative
  measurement of the area of migrated cells. (C) Immunoblotting analysis data. (D)
  ICC staining for β-catenin and total phalloidin. Nuclei were counterstained with
  DAPI. Arrows indicate nucleus-localized β-catenin. (E) Quantitative measurements
  of intensities of β-catenin and phalloidin for the data from the experiments in
  D (n = 12 taken in three different images). (F,G) HaCaT keratinocytes were transfected
  with β-catenin siRNA or negative control for 12 h. After transfection, HaCaT keratinocytes
  were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), E. daniellii extract (1, 5 μg/mL), or VPA
  (100 μM) for 24 h. (F) Immunoblotting analysis data for transfected keratinocytes.
  (G) Representative images of in vitro wound-healing assay of transfected keratinocytes
  and quantitative measurement of wound-closure rate. Original magnification: (A,B),
  ×40; (D), ×400. Values are expressed as means ± SEM. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005; ***
  p < 0.0005, significantly different from vehicle, control, or as indicated.'
