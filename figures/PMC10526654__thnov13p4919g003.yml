caption: TRIM21-mediated WNT/β-catenin through K63 polyubiquitination of β-catenin.
  (A) GSEA of positive regulation of WNT signaling pathway score in human GBMs from
  the GSE108474 (n = 110). (B) Gene oncology enrichment analysis of identified Differential
  Expression Analysis (DEG) by TMT from U87-MG. (C) Western blot analysis to evaluate
  β-catenin and C-myc in lysates prepared from mock, TRIM21-FL and TRIM21-△RING-GBM
  (U87-MG and U251-MG) cells. (D) Western blot analysis to evaluate β-catenin and
  C-myc in lysates prepared from TRIM21 knock down. (E) Immunofluorescence (left)
  and quantitative analysis (right) of β-catenin nuclear translocation induced by
  overexpression of TRIM21. Scale bar,20 µm. (F-G) Overexpression (F) and silencing
  (G) of TRIM21 enhanced and abolished the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, respectively.
  β-catenin protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus were assayed in U87-MG cells with
  up- or down- of TRIM21 by a nuclear extraction assay. (H) Immunoprecipitation was
  performed with U87-MG-OETRIM21-Flag (Left panel) and HEK293-T (Right panel) lysates
  using Flag or β-catenin antibodies, and the precipitants were measured by western
  blotting with the indicated antibodies. (I) The Armadillo domain of β-catenin mediates
  the interaction of this protein with TRIM21 (Top panel), Schematic illustration
  of β-catenin. Bottom panel, β-Catenin deletion mutants were co-expressed with HA-TRIM21
  in 293T cells. the cells were subjected to IP with a HA antibody followed by immunoblotting
  (IB) with FLAG and HA antibodies. (J) In vivo ubiquitination assays performed in
  HEK 293T cells with mock, TRIM21, TRIM21-△RING plasmid, TRIM21-C16A, which then
  were transfected as indicated. Cells were treated with MG132 (10 mM for 4 h) and
  prior to lysis and then subjected to anti-β-catenin IP followed by anti-UB with
  immunoblot analysis. (K) His- Ub (WT, K6R, K27R, K29R, K33R, K48R, K63R) mutants
  were expressed with or without HA-TRIM21 in HEK293T cells. (L) HEK293T cells were
  transfected with Flag-β-catenin and HA-TRIM21 together with wild-type (WT) ubiquitin
  with K48O and K63O respectively. Cells were treated with MG132 (10 mM for 4 h) and
  prior to lysis and then subjected to anti-β-catenin IP followed by anti-His with
  immunoblot analysis.
