caption: Roles of TGF-β- and AMPK-related signaling pathways in metformin’s attenuation
  of MMP2 expression and cancer migration ability. A. Detection of TGF-β secreted
  from PSCs, PDAC organoids, and co-culture of PSCs and PDAC organoids using ELISA.
  The supernatant was obtained after 48 h and activated TGF-β before the analysis.
  The samples were measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. B. The expression
  of TGF-β downstream signaling and MMP2 according to treatment with metformin and/or
  recombinant TGF-β (2 ng/ml), as assessed by Western blotting. The right panel is
  quantitative analysis of band intensity. C. The inhibition effect of AMPK on PSCs
  was confirmed by Western blotting after 48 h of treatment with Compound C. The right
  panel is quantitative analysis of band intensity. D. The expression of TGF-β downstream
  signaling, AMPK, and MMP2 according to treatment with metformin and/or Compound
  C. The data on bar graphs were normalized to β-actin (n = 3 independent isolations).
  E. Representative images of migrated cells. Migration assay was performed to evaluate
  whether the effect of metformin depends on an AMPK pathway. 5 μM Compound C was
  used as an AMPK inhibitor. F. Quantitative analysis of cell migration. Data are
  depicted as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Scale bars, 100 μm.
