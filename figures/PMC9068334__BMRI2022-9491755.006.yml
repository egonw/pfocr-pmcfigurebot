caption: Baicalin inhibited Ras-ERK signaling and cyclin D1 expression in Aβ1-42-treated
  SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was reversed with a MEK activator. (a) SH-SY5Y cell
  extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using P-ERK, total ERK,
  and cyclin D1 antibodies. β-Actin antibodies were used as a reference. (b) p-ERK
  levels normalized to total ERK expression; cyclin D1 expression normalized to β-actin.
  The protein expression is presented as the mean ± SD. N = 3, ∗ represents P < 0.05,
  and ∗∗ represents P < 0.01.
