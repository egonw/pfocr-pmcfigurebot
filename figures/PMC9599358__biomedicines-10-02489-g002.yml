caption: 'c-Myc inhibition promotes the proteasomal degradation of mutp53 independently
  of HSP modulation. (A) PaCa44 and PT45 cells were treated with cMyc inhibitor (i-cMyc)
  (50 Μm) for 48 h, in combination or not with Bortezomib (BZ) added for the last
  4 h of treatments, and p53 expression was evaluated by western blot analyses. βActin
  was used as loading control and one representative experiment is shown. The histograms
  represent the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio of p53/Act. p value:
  * <0.05; ** <0.01; (B) After 48 h of treatment with c-Myc inhibitor (i-cMyc), HSP90,
  HPS70 and HSP27 expression were evaluated by Western blot analyses. βActin was used
  as loading control and one representative experiment is shown. The histograms represent
  the mean ± SD of densitometric analysis of the ratio of HSP90/Act, HSP70/Act and
  HSP27/Act. p value: ** <0.01; *** <0.001; ns = not significant; (C) PT45 cells were
  transfected for 48 with cMyc silencing (si cMyc) or control siRNA-A (scr) and the
  expression level of HSP27 was evaluated by Western blot p value: ** <0.01 (D) PaCa44
  and PT45 cell lines treated with a specific HSP27 inhibitor (i-HSP27) for 24 h were
  assessed for the expression level of p53. βActin was used as loading control and
  one representative experiment is shown. The histograms represent the mean ± SD of
  densitometric analysis of the ratio of p53/Act. ns: Not significant.'
