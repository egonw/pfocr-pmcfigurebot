caption: '(a) Principal components (PC) analysis on tissues from TPMS scaffolds and
  tissues from control group, (b and c) Heatmaps of osteoblast differentiation-related
  genes, Angiogenesis-related factors and Hippo signaling regulation pathways genes
  expression after implant the scaffold for 2â€‰weeks (red: high expression; blue: low
  expression), (d and e) GSEA enrichment analysis, (f) differential alternative splicing
  events between TPMS and control samples, (g) GO enrichment analysis. (h) KEGG pathway
  analysis of DEGs, (i) differentially expressed transcription factors family, and
  (j) RT-qPCR analysis of five genes (VEGFA, S100A4, YAP1, CSF1R, and HES1) related
  osteoblast differentiation, angiogenesis and Hippo signaling regulation pathways.'
