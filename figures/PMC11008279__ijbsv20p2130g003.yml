caption: Dysregulated ribosome biogenesis is a characteristic feature and can be used
  to predict prognosis in TNBC. (A and B) Ribosome biogenesis as the major altered
  pathway (marked in red) in TNBC patient tissues revealed by GO analysis based on
  the iTRAQ proteomics data (A) and GSEA_GO analysis based on the TCGA-BRCA RNA-seq
  data (B). (C) The prognostic risk model comprising 10 ribosome biogenesis-related
  genes. (D) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of TNBC patients in the high- and low-risk
  groups. (E) Time-dependent ROC curves of the model for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS. BP,
  biological process; HR, hazard ratio; OS, overall survival; ROC, receiver-operating
  characteristic; AUC, area under the curve.
