caption: Schematic representation of proposed signaling pathway in B- and D- type
  motor neurons. GÎ±s GSA-1 activates adenylyl cyclase ACY-1, producing more cAMP and
  therefore activating PKA. TWK-7 is a K2P channel that normally decreases locomotion.
  Through a mechanism that is not entirely understood (dotted line) active PKA inhibits
  TWK-7, therefore increasing locomotion. Adapted with permission from [], 2022, Oxford
