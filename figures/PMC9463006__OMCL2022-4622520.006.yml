caption: 'KDM3A overexpression mitigated H/R-induced CMEC pyroptosis through activating
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (a) Protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, GSDMD-N, cleaved-caspase-1,
  IL-1β, and IL-18 were analyzed by Western blot assay. KDM3A overexpression significantly
  downregulated the expressions of pyroptosis-associated proteins while LY294002 treatment
  ameliorated these beneficial effects in the setting of H/R (n = 3,  ∗p < 0.05, compared
  to the H/R+Ad-GFP group, #p < 0.05, compared to the H/R+Ad-KDM3A group). (b) Western
  blot assay was also performed to verify the transfection effects of Ad-KDM3A and
  to detect the expressions of p-Akt after KDM3A overexpression or/and PI3K/Akt inhibition
  under the condition of H/R stimulation. (c) Hoechst 33342/PI double fluorescent
  staining was conducted to assess cell death in each group (n = 6,  ∗p < 0.05, compared
  to the H/R+Ad-GFP group, #p < 0.05, compared to the H/R+Ad-KDM3A group).'
