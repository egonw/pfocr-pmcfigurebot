caption: P and Zn concentrations in shoots and roots of maize supplied with different
  combinations of P and Zn. Inbred line B73 plants were grown in a hydroponic solution
  containing different combinations of P and Zn at the indicated durations before
  shoot and root dry weights (A) and concentrations of Zn (B) and P (C) in shoots
  and roots were determined. Values are means ± SD (n = 4). Means with the same letter
  are not significantly different at P < 0.05 according to the LSD test. *P < 0.05
  and **P < 0.01 (Student’s t-test) indicates a significant difference from the control.
