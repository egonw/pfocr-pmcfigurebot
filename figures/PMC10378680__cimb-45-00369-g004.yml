caption: Schematic diagram of the role of Piezo1 in vascular endothelial cells. Piezo1
  senses fluid shear, leading to Ca2+ influx that activates the eNOS signaling pathway
  and contributing to the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. In addition,
  it induces leukocyte entry and exit by activating the NF-ÎºB pathway to open the
  endothelial barrier (created with https://www.figdraw.com/static/index.html accessed
