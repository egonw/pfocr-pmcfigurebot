caption: The dynamics of the expression of the Notch signaling pathway and Bmp2/Runx2
  in tissues by quantitative PCR analysis. SH—healthy myocardium from sham-operated
  rats (n = 3); 8 h-MI—tissue from the post-infarction zone of the myocardium from
  rats 8 h after induction (n = 4); 24 h-MI—tissue from the post-infarction zone of
  the myocardium from rats 24 h after induction (n = 9). Vertical—the relative amount
  of mRNA in each group, measured by the 2−ΔΔCT method; box plots with whiskers at
  min to the max are presented. * The asterisk shows significant differences between
  SH and MI groups at p < 0.05 (unpaired nonparametric Mann–Whitney test).
