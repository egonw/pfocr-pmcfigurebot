caption: Efficacy of T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L-NP in the LNCaP xenograft mouse model. (A)
  Schematic representation of the treatment regimen of the LNCaP xenograft mouse model.
  (B) Images showing the tumor mass formation in the treatment group as compared to
  its saline control. (C) Scatter plot showing the relative tumor volume (RTV) between
  the saline and the T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L-NP treated group and the (D) change in body
  weight of the animals during the treatment regimen. (E) Immunofluorescence (IF)
  studies performed on the tumor tissues showing the reduction of CPT1A and FASN in
  the T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L-NP-treated group of animals as compared to the saline group.
  RT-PCR studies showing the fold change in the mRNA expression of (F) fatty acid
  oxidation-related (FAO) genes, CPT1A and FASN. (G) Antiapoptotic genes Survivin,
  BCL2, BCL-xL, and cFLIP. Statistical analysis was carried out using an unpaired
  t test with an Î± value of 0.05. (H) Biodistribution of T-Fc-GLU-Platin-L-NPs in
  all the organs of the animals. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of apoptotic markers
  (I) cleaved caspase 3 and (J) caspase 9 in tumor tissues. Red arrows indicate the
  staining of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9.
