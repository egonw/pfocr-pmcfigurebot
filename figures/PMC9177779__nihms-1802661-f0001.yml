figure_title: Histology and molecular features of NMU-induced mammary tumors
caption: Virgin Sprague-Dawley female mice were injected i.p. with NMU and tumors
  harvested at various times after NMU administration herein referred as the characterization
  cohort. A–E, Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were analyzed by hematoxylin–eosin
  (H&E) (A), trichrome (B), immunohistochemical analysis of p63 (C), immunofluorescence
  for Ki67 and SMA (D), and immunofluorescence for progesterone (PR) and estrogen
  receptor (ER) (E). Shown are representative images of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas,
  which were 55 out 59 tumors in the cohort. Scale bar 100 μm. F–I, WGS of EpCAM+
  tumor epithelial cells harvested from 31 NMU-induced tumors from 23 unique rats.
  Liver from tumor-free animal was used as control. F, Tumor mutational burden and
  types of mutations. G, Mutations found in breast cancer–driver genes. H, Frequency
  of mutations in selected breast cancer–driver genes. I, Population frequency of
  genetic aberrations in key breast-cancer pathways. J–L, FACS sorted EpCAM+ tumor
  epithelial cells from NMU-induced tumors harvested from 10 tumors from 8 unique
  rats were analyzed by RNA-seq. Red and blue indicates HRlow and HRhigh tumors, respectively.
  Green and orange marks small and large tumors, respectively. J, Heatmap of gene
  expression Z-scores depicting the RNA expression of hormone receptors and selected
  luminal transcription factors. K, Heatmap of row-normalized Z-scores of genes differentially
  expressed between large (>7mm) and small (≤7mm) tumors. L, Pathways enriched in
  large and small tumors. Red lines indicate pathways highlighted in text. Node size
  indicates the number of genes within the pathway, line width indicates the number
  of shared genes between two gene sets. All tests for significance used Mann Whitney
  Wilcoxon test using a threshold of p=0.05 unless otherwise specified; error bars
  representative of SD; box-whisker plots indicate 0 th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 100th
  percentiles.
