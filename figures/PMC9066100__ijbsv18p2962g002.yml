caption: TRIM44 knockdown inhibits BRCA1 expression and the effect of BRCA1 on HR
  repair. (A) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained from global
  gene expression profiling of shNC (blue) or shTRIM44 (yellow) derived from A549/DDP
  cells using a microarray assay. The normalized expression of genes was indicated
  by the Z score. (B) The “Canonical Pathway Analysis” in the IPA software was used
  to summarize the enrichment of DEGs in the classical signaling pathways, and all
  signaling pathways were ranked using -Log2(P value). (C) Heatmap showing DEGs of
  shNC (purple) or shTRIM44 (green) derived from A549/DDP cells involved in the “Role
  of BRCA1 in DNA damage”. 11 DEGs were down-regulated, including BRCA1 (red), whereas
  3 DEGs were up-regulated. (D) The correlation between the expression of TRIM44 and
  BRCA1 in LUAD samples in the TCGA database is shown. (E-F) The expression of BRCA1
  was reduced following TRIM44 knockdown, according to qRT-PCR (E) and Western blotting
  (F) analysis. (G-H) shNC, shTRIM44-1 and shTRIM44-2 derived by A549/DDP cells were
  treated with 10 μM cisplatin for 24 h. (G) Representative immunofluorescence images
  showing RAD51 foci (left panel) and bar graphs showing the statistical analysis
  (right panel). (H) Representative immunofluorescence images showing γ-H2AX foci
  (left panel) and bar graphs showing the statistical analysis (right panel). Data
  are shown as the mean ± SD. P > 0.05 was considered not significant (N.S.), **P
  < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
