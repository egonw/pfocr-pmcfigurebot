caption: Schematic representation of pathways involved in BAs synthesis and metabolism.
  BAs synthesis takes place from cholesterol in the liver or extrahepatic tissues
  (i.e., macrophages), through the classical and the alternative pathway, respectively.
  Cytochromes CYP7A1, CYP27A1, and CYP8B1 are involved in the classical pathway, while
  cytochromes CYP27A1 and CYP7B1 are in the alternative pathway. Both pathways lead
  to the production of the primary BA, chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), while cholic acid
  (CA) is just synthesized in the hepatic classical pathway. Of the 2 major biosynthetic
  pathways, the classical (CYP7A1) pathway is more important in adult humans in a
  quantitative point of view. Primary BAs neo-synthesized are conjugated with glycine
  or taurine CA and CDCA are conjugated with glycine or taurine by bile acid–CoA synthase
  (BACS) and bile acid–CoA- amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAAT) to produce the GCA,
  TCA, GCDCA, TCDCA and stored in the gallbladder. In presence of CCK, they are released
  into bile in the duodenum where they participate in the digestion of fats. In the
  ileum, under the action of intestinal bacteria, BAs are deconjugated and converted
  into secondary BAs deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic (LCA). In the colon, most
  unconjugated BAs are reabsorbed and transported to the liver by the portal vein,
  to participate in a new round of digestion (enterohepatic circulation). Excess of
  BAs is eliminated by the feces. The figure is original and created with BioRender.com.
