caption: 'Effect of piperine pretreatment on spatial memory deficits in rats with
  KA. (A) The swimming path of rats in the MWM test. (B) Quantitative data of memory
  deficits are presented in the mean escape latency and mean swimming length. Data
  are presented as the means ± S.E.M. (n = 5). # p < 0.001 versus the KA group; ***
  p < 0.001 versus the control group (ANOVA/Scheffé).'
