caption: Direction tuning in conv1 layer. (A, B) shows conv1 response similarity matrix
  (8 × 8) for speed1 and speed2 respectively. Entries in the matrix indicating pairwise
  Euclidean distance between responses to translational motion directions (one sequence
  considered for each direction). The directions are indicated along the axes. From
  the plot one can observe that the conv1 layer produce similar response to the sequences
  with opposite directions. Matrix entries along green lines are positively correlated
  and the entries between orthogonal angle are negatively correlated (values are <0).
