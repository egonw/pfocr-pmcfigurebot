caption: Inhibition of S6K restores the paclitaxel sensitivity in SKOV3-TR cells.
  (A,B) SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in medium treated with 100 nM of paclitaxel and
  20 μM of PF-4708671 for 48 h. (A) The expression of S6K and S6 proteins and their
  phosphorylation were measured by immunoblotting. (B) The cell viabilities were measured
  by MTT assay. (C,D) SKOV3-TR cells were transfected with control and S6K1 siRNA
  for 6 h and were subsequently treated with 100 nM of paclitaxel for 48 h. (C) The
  expression of S6K and S6 proteins and their phosphorylation were measured by immunoblotting.
  (D) The cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. Protein expression was quantified
  as fold changes with respect to the control after normalization of respective β-actin
  levels using ImageJ software. The data are presented as the mean percentage of control
  ± SD relative to the control (n = 3, ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; ns, not significantly
  different). PTX, paclitaxel.
