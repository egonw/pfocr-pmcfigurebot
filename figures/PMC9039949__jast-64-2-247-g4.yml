figure_title: Metabolic pathway mapping significantly different serum (A) and urine
  (B) metabolites compared in healthy and subclinical ketosis group
caption: 'The pathway impact analysis was performed using Metaboanalyst 5.0 software.
  The x-axis represents the pathway impact, and y-axis represents the pathway enrichment.
  The results are presented graphically as a bubble plot. The darker color and larger
  size represent higher p-value from enrichment analysis and greater impact from pathway
  topology analysis, respectively. Metabolic pathway name: 1, Porphrin and chlorophyll
  metabolism; 2, Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; 3, Citrate cycle (tricarboxylic
  acid [TCA] cycle); 4, Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; 5, Tyrosine metabolism;
  6, Butanoate metabolism; 7, Synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies; 8, Valine,
  leucine, and isoleucine degradation; 9, Ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis;
  10, Selenocompound metabolism; 11, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; 12, Valine, leucine
  and isoleucine biosynthesis; 13, Pentose phosphate pathway; 14, Starch and sucrose
  metabolism; 15, Primary bile acid biosynthesis; 16, Tryptophan metabolism.'
