figure_title: GPSM1 expression is upregulated in ATMs from obese mice
caption: a RT-qPCR analysis of GPSM1 mRNA expression in epididymal WAT (eWAT) and
  subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) from lean (blue) or obese (red) mice. For DIO, WT male
  mice were fed normal chow diet (NCD) (n = 11 biologically independent sample) or
  high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 11 biologically independent sample) for 12 weeks. For genetic
  obesity, a group of WT (n = 10 biologically independent mice) and Ob/Ob (n = 10
  biologically independent mice) and a separate group of WT (n = 9 biologically independent
  mice) and Db/Db (n = 9 biologically independent mice) were analyzed. Representative
  western blot analysis and quantification of GPSM1 expression in eWAT (b) and scWAT
  (c) from NCD and HFD mice (n = 6 biologically independent sample per group). d IHC
  staining and quantitative analysis of GPSM1 in eWAT and scWAT from NCD and HFD mice
  (n = 3 biologically independent sample per group). Scale bars, 100 μm. e RT-qPCR
  analysis of GPSM1 mRNA expression in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and adipocyte
  fraction (MAF) isolated from eWAT from NCD (n = 5 biologically independent mice)
  or HFD (n = 6 biologically independent mice). f Representative western blot analysis
  and quantification of GPSM1 expression in SVFs isolated of eWAT (n = 4 biologically
  independent mice per group). g Immunofluorescence images of staining with antibodies
  against GPSM1 (red) and F4/80 (green) in eWAT of HFD-fed mice. Nuclei were stained
  with DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 100 μm. h Representative western blot analysis and
  quantification of GPSM1 expression in sorted F4/80+ macrophages isolated from eWAT
  SVFs (n = 4 biologically independent mice per group). Ponceau S was used as a loading
  control. Independent experiments were repeated three times with similar results
  (g). All data are presented as means ± SEM (a–f, h). P values are determined by
  two-tailed Student’s t-test (a–f, h).
