caption: The ETI response activates PR-1 in an SA-dependent and an SA-independent
  fashion. The activation of PR-1 depends on TGA from clade II in the pathway dependent
  on SA. On the other hand, Mitogenâ€“Activated Protein Kinases 3 and 6 (MPK3/6) activation
  triggers the SA-independent PR-1 induction []. Additionally, the activation of MPK3
  induces the activation of genes that participate in SA accumulation (IC*) independently
  of SA []. According to our model, TGA factors from clade II (TGA) can repress the
  MPK3/6 branch. Thus, in the tga256 mutant plants, the repression of TGA over the
  MPK branch is absent, permitting increased SA accumulation (), the genes (), and
  the PR-1 expression () dependent on MPKs. It is also possible, and not mutually
  exclusive, that upon stimulation of SA accumulation by ETI, the TGA factors negatively
  feedback on SA accumulation by suppressing a step upstream of SA accumulation, independent
  of MPK3/6 signaling.
