  (A) The injection of human monoclonal antibody directed against the inhibitory receptors
  stimulate NK cells function by inhibitory signaling pathway disruption. (B) The
  Tocilzumab antibody directed against IL‐8, IL‐6, and TNF enhance NK cell cytotoxicity
  and clear infection in SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. (C) The armed NK cells can be obtained
  from cord blood CD34+ and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) differentiation.
  The expansion and perfusion of differentiated NK cells clear infection in COVID‐19
  patients with severe disease. NK, Natural Killer.
