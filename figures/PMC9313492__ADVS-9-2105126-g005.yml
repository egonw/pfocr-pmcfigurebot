caption: GalNac‐siHK2 administration effectively attenuates the growth of orthotopic
  tumor xenografts in vivo. a) A schematic diagram of the orthotopic tumor xenograft
  studies. HUH7 cells stably expressing GFP‐luciferase were injected into the livers
  of BALB/c nude mice in situ. After 7 d, mice were separated into two groups (n =
  6) and treated with negative control (GalNac‐siNC) or GalNac‐siHK2 (5 mg kg−1).
  GalNac‐siHK2 was treated every 7 d. In vivo imaging to analyze the tumor growth.
  b) In vivo images showing the tumor growth of mice treated with the negative control
  and GalNac‐siHK2. c) Statistics of the radiance abundance of in vivo images. d)
  Real‐time qPCR showing HK2 and ACSL4 mRNA expression in tumor samples of the negative
  control and GalNac‐siHK2 treatment groups. Data are represented as the mean ± SD
  (n = 6 or 3, respectively). Unpaired t‐test. e) Western blots measuring HK2 and
  ACSL4 expression in tumor samples of the negative control and GalNac‐siHK2 treatment
  groups (n = 6 or 3, respectively). f) Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the
  expression of HK2, ACSL4, and Ki67 in orthotopic tumor xenograft samples. Scale
  bar represents 100 µm. g) The working model shows that HK2 stimulates maintenance
  of stemness and self‐renewal of liver CSCs. Upregulated HK2 expression promoted
  the levels of acetyl‐CoA in HCC cells. HK2 accumulates acetyl‐CoA in HCC cells,
  induces promoter and enhancer histone acetylation, and activates the transcription
  of ACSL4, thus providing fatty acids for β‐oxidation. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
