figure_title: Purine metabolites in LPS-treated macrophages
caption: A, Summary of the abundance of TCA cycle and purine metabolites at the indicated
  time points after LPS stimulation, based on data (), B, Quantification of ATP synthase
  activity at the indicated time points in LPS-treated macrophages C, Quantification
  of ATP and ADP at the indicated time points after LPS stimulation. D, Abundance
  of AMP at the indicated time points in LPS-treated macrophages. E, Transcription
  of genes in the ATP salvage pathway in LPS-treated macrophages F, Quantification
  of ATP, ADP and AMP at 8 and 12 h after exposure to the indicated concentration
  of LPS. G. Transcripts of genes involved in de novo ATP synthesis were quantified
  by PCR. Results (B-G) are displayed as mean Â± SEM, and significant differences are
  identified (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) as determined by non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis
  one-way analysis with Dunn multiple comparison post hoc test for results.
