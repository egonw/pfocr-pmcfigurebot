caption: Differentially active metabolic pathway between subtypes. (A,B) Volcano plot
  for differentially active metabolic pathway between cluster 1 and cluster 2 in CGGA
  array (301) and CGGA RNAseq (693) cohorts according to fold-change method. Red points
  mean the pathways that upregulated in cluster 1 compared with cluster 2, and blue
  points mean downregulation. Number of differential up- and down-regulated pathways
  in (A) is 38 and 32, respectively; number of differentials up- and down-regulated
  pathways in (B) is 36 and 16, respectively. (Câ€“F) Distribution of pathway enrichment
  score between two clusters in CGGA array (301) and CGGA RNAseq (693) cohorts, one-sided
  Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to evaluate the difference.
