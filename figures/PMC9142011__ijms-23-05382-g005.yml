caption: 'The total expression of proteins belonging to the insulin signaling pathway,
  e.g., (A) pAkt (Ser 473)/Akt and (B) pGSK3ß (Ser9)/GSK3ß, in the subcutaneous (SAT)
  and visceral (VAT) adipose tissues of rats fed a standard diet (control) or high-fat
  diet (HFD) after chronic cannabidiol (CBD) treatment. The total expression of the
  above proteins was standardized to the total protein expression, and the control
  group was set to 100%. The data are expressed as mean values ± SD, n = 6 in each
  group. ap < 0.05: significant difference: control group vs. experimental group;
  bp < 0.05: significant difference: HFD vs. HFD+CBD.'
