caption: ISOC1 mediates macrophage inflammatory response via AKT1 and NF-κB pathway.
  (A) Wild-type or ISOC1-deficient RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 300 ng/mL LPS
  for 24 h. Cell lysates were collected, and western blotting was used to detect the
  phosphorylation levels of AKT1, IκBα, and ERK. (B,C) ISOC1-deficient RAW264.7 cells
  were pretreated with 10 μM Perifosine for 12 h (B) or 10 μM BAY 11-7082 for 1.5
  h (C) and stimulated with 300 ng/mL LPS for 24 h. Expressions of the COX-2 protein
  were detected by Western blotting. (D,E) Wild-type and ISOC1-deficient RAW264.7
  cells were pretreated with 10 μM Perifosine for 12 h (D) or 10 μM BAY 11-7082 for
  1.5 h (E) and stimulated with 300 ng/mL LPS for 24 h. qRT-PCR was used to detect
  the expression levels of IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-12. All data are shown as mean
  ± s.e.m (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; n.s. not significant. Two-way ANOVA followed
  by Bonferroni post hoc test was used for data analysis.
