caption: RR‐171 activated the NF‐Kappa B signalling pathway in HCC cells. (A) Analysis
  of a phosphospecific protein microarray showing more than 10% of these proteins
  whose phosphorylation levels were upregulated or downregulated in HCC cells treated
  with RR‐171, which were labelled red and blue, respectively. (B) KEGG analysis of
  proteins in the phosphospecific protein microarray showing cancer‐related signalling
  pathways. A heatmap was formed according to the ratio values of these phosphorylated
  proteins in the NF‐kappa B signalling pathway. The red block represents a high ratio,
  and the green block represents a low ratio in the heatmap. (C) Analysis of a phosphospecific
  protein microarray showing the changes in several key phosphoproteins crucial for
  the NF‐kappa B pathway, cell cycle pathway and apoptosis pathway. (D) Analysis of
  Western blotting showing the phosphorylation levels of these proteins (BLNK, IKKβ,
  IκBα and P65), which play a key role in the NF‐kappa B signalling pathway. (E,F)
  Quantification of D from the Western blotting experiments. The data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM. (G) CCK‐8 assay showing the OD450 of HCC cell lines treated with
  curcumin in four groups (DMSO + RR‐170 group, Curcumin + RR‐170 group, DMSO + RR‐171
  group and Curcumin + RR‐171 group). (H) Proposed model showing the general process
  by which RR‐171 induces HCC cell death. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
