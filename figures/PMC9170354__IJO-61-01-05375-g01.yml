caption: Identification of the JAK2/STAT3 axis as a specific communicator between
  CAFs and GC cells. (A) Schematic diagram of secretome analysis of conditioned media
  and transcriptome and western blot analysis for MKN1 cells, MKN74 cells and SNU668
  cells. IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2 were secreted at higher levels in co-cultured with CAFs
  relative to MKN74 cells and SNU668 cells cultured alone. These factors were all
  associated with the JAK/STAT3 signal transduction pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis
  revealed that the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling-related genes were enriched in MKN74
  cells and SNU668 cells co-cultured with CAFs (MKN-74 cell enrichment score, 1.83,
  nominal P<0.001, FDR Q=0.001, FWER P=0.006; SNU668 cell enrichment score, 1.456;
  nominal P<0.01, FDR Q=0.01, FWER P=0.145). (B) KEGG pathway analysis expressed increased
  genes between no co-culture and co-culture with CAFs in MKN1 cells, MKN74 cells
  and SNU668 cells. (C) Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of the
  indicated proteins after co-culture with CAFs in MKN1 cells, MKN74 cells and SNU668
  cells. (D) Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of the indicated
  proteins following 5-FU treatment with or without co-culture with CAFs in MKN1 cells,
  MKN74 cells and SNU668 cells. 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast;
  GC, gastric cancer; CCL2, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia

  kinase; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
