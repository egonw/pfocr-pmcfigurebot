caption: Knock-down miR-26a-3p caused dendrite spine loss in hippocampal neurons.
  A Representative images of hippocampus via Golgi staining. B The dendritic intersections
  against the radial distance from the soma were significantly decreased after knock-down
  miR-26a-3p. C The intersection number within 200 μm was decreased after knock-down
  of miR-26a-3p. D Representative images of dendrite in neurons of hippocampus. E
  The number of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons was decreased after knock-down
  of miR-26a-3p. Data are presented as the means ± SEMs. N = 6 per group. 30 dendritic
  segments from 6 rats per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
