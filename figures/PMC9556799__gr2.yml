caption: Integration of host genes and enrichment analysis(A and B) Venn plot shows
  the overlap between all (A) and SARS-CoV-2 (B) host genes curated in three categories.(C)
  All host genes with direction. Labeled purple nodes are genes shared by SARS-CoV
  and SARS-CoV-2.(D and E) Labeled pink nodes are genes shared by SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.
  Labeled bright cyan nodes are genes shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In the middle
  gray are genes shared by the three viruses. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of
  antiviral genes (D) and proviral genes (E).
