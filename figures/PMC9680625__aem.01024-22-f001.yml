caption: 'Proposed carbofuran-catabolic pathway in the reported strains. (A) The lowercase
  letters in brackets ([]) under the compounds indicate that the compound was detected
  in the degradation of carbofuran by these strains: [a] Novosphingobium sp. KN65.2
  (), [b] Novosphingobium sp. FND-3 (), [c] Sphingomonas sp. CDS-1 (), [d] Sphingomonas
  sp. strain SB5 (), [e] Sphingomonas sp. CF06 (), [f] Pseudomonas sp. CRL-OK (),
  [g] Achromobacter sp. WM111 (), and [h] Paracoccus sp. YM3 (). The orange arrow-marked
  carbofuran metabolic pathway was employed by strain CFD-1 in this study. (B) Genomic
  context of carbofuran catabolism-related genes in different carbofuran-degrading
  strains. The nearly identical ORFs are drawn in the same color.'
