caption: Treatment strategies for epithelial ovarian carcinoma. (Aâ€“E) Treatment regimes
  described in the text for subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer in (A) high-grade
  serous HGSOC, (B) clear cell carcinoma CCC, (C) endometrioid EC, (D) mucinous MOC,
  and (E) low-grade serous LGSOC with the compounds listed. Compounds in clinical
  trials are shown with the associated clinical trial numbers from the ClinicalTrials.gov
  database if applicable. Not available (n/a) refers to compounds involved in studies
  without clinical support. Molecular targets of each compound affecting RAS/MAPK
  pathway (blue), receptors (green), and other targets (yellow) are shown.
