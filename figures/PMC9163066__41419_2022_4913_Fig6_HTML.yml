figure_title: LIF is the direct target gene of both miR-140-3p and miR-335
caption: A Bioinformatic analysis predicted that LIF was the potential direct target
  gene of both miR-140-3p and miR-335. B, C qRT-PCR analysis showed that miRNA inhibitors
  increased the expression level of LIF, while miRNA mimics suppressed the expression
  level of LIF. D, F Western blot results showed the expression level of LIF after
  transfecting with miRNA inhibitors or miRNA mimics in PC3 cells. E, G Dual-luciferase
  reporter assays revealed that both miR-140-3p and miR-335 could bind to the 3′ UTR
  of LIF, and could suppress the luciferase ability. H Pearson correlation analyses
  showed that both miR-140-3p and miR-335 in PCa tissues (n = 30) were negatively
  correlated with LIF. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments.
