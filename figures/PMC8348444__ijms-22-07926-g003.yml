caption: Heatmap analysis of gene expressions in JA biosynthetic process (A), JA signaling
  pathway (B) and response to JA (C) in 4th-stage-florets of PA64S, D52S and NK58S.
  Data are normalized and transformed by log2FC of gene expression in fertile plants,
  compared to those in sterile plants (n = 3). FC, fold change; S/F, sterile/fertile
  plants.
