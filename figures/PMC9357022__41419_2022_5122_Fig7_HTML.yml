figure_title: CRTC overexpression suppresses protein aggregates accumulated in aged
  muscles
caption: 'a CRE-Luc activity in thoraces increased during aging. LUC activity at 3d
  and 20d-old thoraces were compared. n = 6 for each condition. Student’s t-Test for
  statistical analysis. *P < 0.05. Genotype: 5xCRE-LUC. b, c Age associated FK2 positive
  aggregates were ameliorated by CRTC overexpression. FK2 positive aggregates in 3d
  and 20d-old muscles were quantified. Representative confocal images were shown on
  the left (b). FK2 positive aggregates with pixel size bigger than 5 were quantified
  on the right (c). Student’s t-test for statistical analysis. **p < 0.01. Genotypes:
  IFM-Gal4; UAS-RFP or IFM-Gal4; UAS-CRTC-HA. d CRTC/CREB functions downstream of
  ROS/JNK pathway as a sensor to suppress proteotoxic stresses. Genetical or pharmacological
  inhibition of proteasome causes CREB activation through ROS/JNK cascade in flies.
  Together with CRTC, CREB promotes protein folding and proteasome activity by increase
  transcription of redox regulators, such as molecular chaperones, proteosome subunits,
  and ROS scavengers. Hence, increasing CRTC/CREB activity reduces protein aggregates
  and rescues pathogenesis of protein conformational disorders, such as Huntington’s
  disease (HD). CRTC cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activators, CREB cAMP Responsible
  Element Binding Protein, CRE cAMP responsive element.'
