caption: Effect of Lactucin on apoptosis induction of lung cancer cells. Lactucin
  and equivalent volume of the vehicle (DMSO) exposure (24 h) induced apoptosis of
  lung adenocarcinoma A549 (80 μM) and H2347 (70 μM) cells (A) were measured by flow
  cytometry. WB analysis of c-Caspase-3, c-PARP, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein expression
  was performed after A549 and H2347 cells were exposure to Lactucin at 0, 20, 40,
  and 80 μM for 24 h (B–D). Data are expressed as the means ± standard deviation of
  triplicate experiments. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001 indicate
  result’s significant difference from the control.
