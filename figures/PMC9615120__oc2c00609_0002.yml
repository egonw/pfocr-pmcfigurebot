caption: 'BDW568 activates IFN signaling by targeting STING. (a) Dose–response curves
  of the BDW568 in THP-1 reporter (STING+/+), THP-1 reporter STING knockout (STING–/–),
  and STING-HAQ-expressing cells based on the STING–/– cell line. (b) Immunoblot analysis
  of the STING pathway in wildtype THP-1 cells treated with 50 μM BDW568 at different
  time points (loading control, γ-tubulin). Data are representative of two independent
  experiments. (c) Dose–response curves of BDW568 in TBK1 and IRF3 knockout THP-1
  reporter cells using two sgRNA sequences and commercially available THP-1 reporter
  cGAS–/– cells (NTC, nontargeting control using scrambled sgRNA sequence). (d) Dose–response
  curves of BDW568 in THP-1 reporter STING–/– cells overexpressing STING-AQ, -HQ,
  or -HA variants. (e) Chemical structure of DMXAA and crystal structure of DMXAA-bound
  STINGI230 (aa 155–341) (PDB: 4QXP). The symmetrical STINGI230 dimer is shown with
  individual monomers colored in gray and light blue (residue I230 in each monomer,
  red and blue sticks; bound DMXAA, green sticks). (f) Dose–response curves of BDW568
  and DMXAA in THP-1 reporter STING–/–cells overexpressing STING A230 and I230 variants.
  All dose–response curves are representative of three experiments; error bars represent
  ± s.d. for four biological replicates.'
