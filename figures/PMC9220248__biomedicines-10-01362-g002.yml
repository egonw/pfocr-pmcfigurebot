caption: Mechanism of type 2 inflammation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis
  with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The dysregulated epithelial barrier results in an enhanced
  exposure to inhaled pathogens and allergens. In response to environmental stimuli,
  epithelial cells secrete inflammatory mediators, such as TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33,
  thus promoting the development of the type 2 immune response. In this pathway, na√Øve
  T cells (Th0) differentiate into Th2 cells, leading to the secretion of IL-4, IL-5,
  and IL-13. Innate immune cells, including ILC2, eosinophils, and mast cells, are
  activated and release type 2 cytokines that further perpetuate the ongoing inflammatory
  response and specific granule proteins that contribute to tissue injury. B cells
  and activated plasma cells are also increased, thus contributing to the enhanced
  local generation of antibodies. Type 2 cytokines can result in decreased tissue
  plasminogen activator and increased FXIIIA levels, which, in a state of an increased
  vascular leak, can lead to enhanced fibrin cross-linking and deposition within nasal
  polyps. In a type 2 inflammatory pathway with a general lack of regulatory T cells
  function, IL-5 triggers eosinophilia, and IL-4 and IL-13 are responsible for local
  IgE production by B cells. Furthermore, IL-4 and IL-13 lead to goblet cells hyperplasia
  and excess mucus production.
