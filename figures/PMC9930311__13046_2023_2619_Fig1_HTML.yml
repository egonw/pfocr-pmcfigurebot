caption: CRC-CDEs promote cell migration, tube formation, and filopodia formation
  of HUVECs. a Diagram of ultracentrifugation method. b Western blot of non-lysed
  HCT116-Exo and SW480 protein (CD9, CD63, and TSG-101). c TEM images of obtained
  exosome from the cell culture supernatant of HCT116 and SW480 (HCT116-Exo and SW480-Exo).
  Scale bar = 200 nm. d NTA analysis of size distribution and number in HCT116-Exo
  and SW480-Exo. e Schematic description of exosome labeled by PKH67 membrane dye.
  HCT116-Exo and SW480-Exo from 1 × 107 HCT116 were isolated and cultured with 1 × 10.5
  HUVECs. f Confocal microscopy image of PKH67-labeled exosome in HUVECs after 3 h.
  Scale bars = 10 μm and 20 μm. HUVECs incubated with PBS were used as a negative
  control. Migration (g) and Tube formation (h) of HUVECs cultured with exosome (10ug
  or 30ug) from HCT116 (116) and SW480 (480) after 48 h. HUVECs incubated with PBS
  were used as a negative control. i The number of migrated cells and nodes was analyzed
  by Image J. h Confocal microscopy image of phalloidin-labeled F-actin and PKH67-labeled
  exosome in HUVECs after 24 h. Scale bars = 10 μm. Mean ± SEM. Student's t-test,
