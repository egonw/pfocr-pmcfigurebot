caption: 'Piecewise structural equation modelling showing the standardized pathways
  for all response and explanatory variables based on coefficient estimates. The arrowhead
  indicates the pathway of the relationship, where one variable influenced the other.
  Green arrows with solid lines indicate a positive relationship between the two variables
  whereas red arrows with dashed lines indicate a negative relationship between the
  two variables. Note that the variables with binary responses were coded as: male/yes
  = 1; female/no = 0. Asterisks represent the significance levels of p-values in increasing
  order: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001. R2m indicates marginal R2, R2c indicates
  conditional R2 whereas s.e. indicates standard error. Note that p-values > 0.05
  indicated that the variables in the model were conditionally independent and all
  potential significant paths were included in the model.'
