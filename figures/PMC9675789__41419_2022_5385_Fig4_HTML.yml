figure_title: OCT4-SOX2-TCF-NANOG is enriched in dormant and reactivated cancer cells
caption: The open chromatin in cells were evaluated by ATAC-seq. A HOMER motif analysis
  for transcription factor binding sites in regions of open chromatin. The frequency
  of transcription factor binding sites of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 within the open chromatin
  was expressed as a percentage. The motif enrichment P-value was indicated. B The
  accessibility of representative motifs (mean motif enrichment P value) among ATAC-seq
  of the 3 cell phases induced by cisplatin. C The differential peaks were subjected
  to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis between dormant cancer cells and untreated cancer
  cells (upper); between reactivated cancer cells and dormant cancer cells (below);
  D The integrative genomics viewer (IGV) visualization of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq near
  STAT3, Nanog, Myc gene loci in 3 cell phases. E Spearman’s correlation analysis.
  The correlation between the promoter accessibility of stem cell-related genes and
  expressions of Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 was evaluated, *P < 0.05. F The genomic profiles
  of specific differentially accessible regions of representative target genes of
  Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 were visualized by integrative genomics viewer (IGV).
