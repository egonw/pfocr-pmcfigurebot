caption: 'Effects of DHRS11 knockdown on androgen signaling induced by Adione or 11KAdione
  in C4-2 cells. The cells were treated with Adione (A,B) or 11KAdione (C,D) 24 h
  after transfection with DHRS11 siRNA (si-1 or si-2) or universal negative siRNA
  (Neg) and incubated for another 24 h. Treatment with a DHRS11 inhibitor, carbenoxolone
  (Car), was performed 2 h before the treatment with Adione or 11KAdione. (A,C) PSA
  expression. The expression levels analyzed by RT-qPCR. ** p < 0.01, NS p > 0.05
  denotes significantly different from the cells treated with DMSO alone. ## p < 0.01,
  # p < 0.05 denotes significantly different from the cells treated with 10 nM Adione
  or 11KAdione alone. (B,D) Nuclear expression of AR and Ki67. AR (green), Ki67 (red)
  and DNA (blue) were visualized by immunofluorescence using the antibodies against
  AR and Ki67 and DAPI, respectively. Merged images are also shown. Scale bar indicates
  20 μm.'
