caption: 'The role of the STING pathway in tumor suppression. In the tumor microenvironment,
  cGAS-STING in DCs plays an important role in the cross-presentation and priming
  of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Tumor-derived DNA can be taken up by DCs such as
  protein antigen, resulting in the upregulation of type I IFN. Type I IFN reinforces
  the cross-presentation of DCs by promoting antigen retention and CD8+ DCs survival.
  DCs cultured with type I IFN show increased expression of CCR7, which indicates
  an improved lymph node-homing capability. Additionally, type I IFN upregulates the
  expression of multiple Th1 chemokines, including CXCL9 and CXCL10, which is important
  for the homing of APC and trafficking of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Abbreviations:
  CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; CXCL9, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9; IFN, interferon;
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1/PD-L1, anti-programmed death-1/programmed
  death-ligand 1; TA, tumor antigen; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
