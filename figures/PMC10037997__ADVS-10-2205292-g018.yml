caption: Interaction between graphene materials and cells and typical cytotoxicity
  pathways induced by graphene materials. a) SEM images of graphene‐treated RAW 264.7
  cells of control and p‐G (75 µg mL−1). Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright 2012,
  Wiley‐VCH. b) TEM images of interactions of GO or rGO (50 µg mL−1) with THP‐1 cells.

  and intracellular ROS levels of RAW 264.7 cells treated with different concentrations
  of p‐G, and the schematic diagram of cell apoptosis by ROS generation induced by
  p‐G. Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright 2011, Elsevier Ltd. d) Mitochondria‐dependent
  apoptosis pathway derived from IPA analysis of RNA‐sequencing data of BEAS‐2B cells
  exposed to GO‐US (5 µg mL−1) for 28 days, and ATP level/MMP decay of cells after
  exposure of GO with different sizes (1–30 µm, 50 nm–2 µm, and 50–300 nm) and doses
  for two days. Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright 2020, Wiley‐VCH.
