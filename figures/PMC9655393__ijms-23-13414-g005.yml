caption: Activin-A/follistatin system is changed and the JNK/c-Jun pathway is activated
  in MED1 knockdown keratinocytes. (A) Relative expression of mRNA encoding for FST
  and ACT-A following transfection in HOK, (B) Relative expression of protein for
  FST and ACT-A following transfection in HOK, (C) Relative mRNA expression of JNK,
  c-Jun, ERK and p38, (D) Western blot assays for c-Jun, P-c-Jun, JNK, P-JNK, ERK,
  P-ERK, p38 and P-p38 in HOK after transfection, (E) The results of CCK-8 assay for
  sh-MED1 cells following the addition of SP600125, (F) The results of scratch wound
  assays for sh-MED1 cells following the addition of SP600125, and (G) Quantitative
  analysis of migrated cells, (H) Proposed model of accelerated oral mucosal wound
  healing in Med1epi−/− mice. Scale bar = 200 μm. Bars = means ± SD. ns means nonsignificant,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
