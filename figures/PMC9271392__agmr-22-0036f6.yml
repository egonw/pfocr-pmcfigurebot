caption: Mechanism of sclerostin as inhibitor of Wnt4 signaling in muscle via Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway and Wnt4’s effect to myostatin.,,,,,) (Left and center) Wnt4 bone
  and muscle crosstalk occurs via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which inhibit
  by sclerostin. Wnt4 overexpression increased Myf5 expression, which is necessary
  for myogenesis. (Right) Myostatin is also thought to be involved in the Wnt4 pathway.
  Wnt4 induces myogenesis by inhibiting myostatin thus preventing muscle wasting and
  cachexia. Myf5, myogenic factor 5; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; GSK3,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; Dsh, disheveled; TCF/LEF,
  T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor.
