caption: MARCKS participates in mediating target signaling pathways to drive malignant
  phenotypes that lead to cancer metastasis (through actin rearrangement, MMP9, ErbB2,
  NF-κB, and AKT pathways), cancer stemness (through the NF-κB pathway), and therapeutic
  resistance (through AKT, ABCB1, and stemness genes—SOX2, OCT4, and CD133).
