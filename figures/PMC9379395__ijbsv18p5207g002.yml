caption: CircNDRG1 was up-regulated after nitroxoline treatment. (A) Venn diagram
  of the intersection among up-regulated circRNAs in 4 bladder cancer cells. (B) Heatmap
  of circRNA-seq analysis showed top 31 differentially high expressed circRNAs of
  4 bladder cancer cells. (C) Schematic illustration demonstrates circNDRG1 formation
  via exons 4-7 circularization of NDRG1. (D) RT-qPCR was utilized to analyze the
  circNDRG1 expression. (E) RT-qPCR was used to determine the abundances of circNDRG1
  and linear mRNA NDRG1 in T24 and UM-UC-3 cells treated with RNase R. (F) Transcription
  half-life of circNDRG1 and linear mRNA NDRG1 was demonstrated at the indicated times
  after adding actinomycin D. (G) Southern-blotting was used to analyze the amplification
  of divergent (◀▶) and convergent (▶◀) primers in cDNA and gDNA. (H and I) Nuclear-cytoplasm
  separation RT-qPCR assay showed circNDRG1 was predominantly localized in cytoplasm.
