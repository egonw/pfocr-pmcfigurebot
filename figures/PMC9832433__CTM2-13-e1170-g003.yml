caption: Neutrophils and NETs induce a pro‐inflammatory and pro‐angiogenic endothelial
  cell phenotype via activation of NF‐κB signalling. (A) NETs stimulate pro‐inflammatory
  and pro‐angiogenic responses in human endothelial cells via MPO/H2O2‐mediated NF‐κB
  activation. Moreover, NETs activate several neutrophil functions, such as exocytosis,
  ROS production, and NET formation, which may be related to the phosphorylation of
  Akt, ERK1/2 and p38. In addition to the impacts on neutrophils, NETs induce an “M1‐like”
  macrophage phenotype characterized by releasing inflammatory cytokines, such as
  IL‐8. Moreover, the concentration of IL‐8 is found to be strongly linked with NET
  formation via MAPK pathway activation. LL‐37, an antibacterial protein externalized
  on NETs, can suppress macrophage pyroptosis and then inhibit the release of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines. (B) NF‐κB signalling enhances endothelial cell pro‐inflammatory and pro‐angiogenic
  responses via up‐regulation of ICAM‐1, VCAM‐1, PECAM‐1, and increased secretion
  of IL‐6, IL‐8, and VEGF‐A. Additionally, many pro‐angiogenic factors, such as VEGF,
  PDGE and FGF, are released during the process. These factors increase expression
  levels of glycolytic enzymes and transporters via up‐regulation of MYC and HIF‐1α
  and down‐regulation of FOXO1. (C) During inflammatory and angiogenic responses,
  proliferated endothelial cells show a higher rate of glycolysis than quiescent ones
  due to the up‐regulation of glycolytic enzymes and transporters, such as GLUT1,
  PFKFB3, HK, PK and LDH‐A. Notably, PFKFB3 and glycolytic product lactate promote
  NF‐κB‐driven vascular inflammation. F1,6BP, fructose‐1,6‐biphosphate; F2,6BP, fructose‐2,6‐biphosphate;
