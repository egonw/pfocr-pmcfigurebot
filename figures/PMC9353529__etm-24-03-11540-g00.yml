caption: 'Effect of ROCK2 silencing on LPS-induced HK-2 cytotoxicity. (A) mRNA and
  (B) protein expression levels of ROCK2 in control and LPS-induced HK-2 cells were
  measured using RT-qPCR and western blot assays, respectively. (C) mRNA and (D) protein
  expression levels of ROCK2 in control and HK-2 cells transfected with indicated
  shRNAs were measured using RT-qPCR and western blot assays, respectively. The (E)
  mRNA and (F) protein expression levels of ROCK2 in control and LPS-induced HK-2
  cells transfected with indicated shRNAs were measured using RT-qPCR and western
  blot assays, respectively. (G) Cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. (H)
  LDH production was measured using a commercially available LDH release assay kit.
  ***P<0.001 vs. control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. LPS + shRNA-NC. ROCK2, Rho-associated
  protein kinase 2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR; sh, short hairpin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NC, negative control.'
