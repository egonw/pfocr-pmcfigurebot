caption: The abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction pathway analysis in RNA-Seq.
  (A) Schematic diagram showing ABA signal transduction pathway; the red boxes represent
  upregulated modules, the green boxes represent downregulated modules, while the
  blue boxes represent upregulated and downregulated DEGs; (B) The expression profile
  of DEGs in modules enriched in pathways, the color from blue to red represent the
  expression from low to high; (C) The ABA content analysis under CK and drought treatments.
  The grey columns with black squares represent drought stress while white columns
  with black circles represent CK treatment. The different lower-case letters above
  the columns denote significant differences (Î± = 0.05, LSD).
