figure_title: Mechanistic diagram of apatinib in NSCLC cells
caption: Apatinib inhibits GLS1, which leads to the activation of ATF4. ATF4 upregulates
  SLC1A5 and ASNS by binding to their promoters. The increase in SLC1A5 contributes
  to the overabsorption of glutamine. The upregulation of ASNS promotes the reaction
  of glutamine and aspartate to generate glutamate and asparagine. Thus, apatinib
  enhances the uptake and catabolism of glutamine in NSCLC cells.
article_title: Activated amino acid response pathway generates apatinib resistance
  by reprograming glutamine metabolism in non-small-cell lung cancer.
