caption: A schematic view of Adenylyl cyclase (AC) signaling pathway and the effects
  of shear stress in red blood cells. Shear stress could activate some non-selective
  cation channels which causes calcium (Ca+2) entry. Ca+2 ions bind Calmodulin (CaM)
  and activate membrane bound AC which is also activated by β2 adrenergic receptors
  (βAR) and prostacyclin receptors (IPR). AC catalyzes the conversion of adenosine
  monophosphate (AMP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (Chu et al.) that activates
  Protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphodiesterases (PDE) facilitate the conversion of cAMP
  to AMP or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP).
