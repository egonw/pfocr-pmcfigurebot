caption: Intra-CSF Subcortical Biodistribution Data. The parent IgG1 antibody penetrated
  deep into the hippocampal parenchyma within 30 min of administration into the rat
  cisterna magna. Representative images. Intra-CSF delivery of ABT-806 at a dose of
  0.3 mg/kg resulted in the penetration of the antibody into the deeper brain regions,
  including the hippocampus, as early as 30 min post injection. The antibody was still
  present in the subcortical regions after 24 h. Blue = DAPI, Red = ABT-806. n = 3
  animals per timepoint.
