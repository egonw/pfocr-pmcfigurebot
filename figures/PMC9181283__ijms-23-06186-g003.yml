caption: 'The unifying hypothesis comprises mechanisms by which glucose at each level
  of glycolysis contributes to the generation of late diabetic complications. Under
  physiological conditions, glucose is metabolised through the glycolytic pathway.
  Increase in intracellular glucose leads to increased flux of glucose to sorbitol
  via the polyol pathway, to an increase in the hexosamine pathway, to activation
  of protein kinase C (PKC), and to formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
  in endothelial cells. AKR = aldose reductase, SDH = sorbitol dehydrogenase, GFAT
  = glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, GlcNAc = N-Acetylglucosamin,
  DAG = diaclyglycerol, PKC = proteinkinase C, G3P = glyceraldehyd 3-phosphate, DHAP
  = dihydroxyacetone phosphate.'
