caption: M-PgPs inhibit the innate host defense of HGECs. Relative mRNA expression
  levels of IL-1β (A1,A2), TNF (B1,B2), IL-10 (C1,C2), and TGF-β2 (D1,D2)in HGECs
  after the treatment of M-PgPs (1:100) for 24 h were analyzed using RT-qPCR. (A1–D1)
  Under normal condition without IL-1β pre-treatment. (A2–D2) Under inflammatory condition
  with IL-1β pre-treatment. HGECs without any treatment served as blank control (BL).
  HGECs treated with P. gingivalis (1:100, 24 h) served as positive control. IL-1β
  (1 ng mL−1) was added 6 h before M-PgPs and P. gingivalis treatment. * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
