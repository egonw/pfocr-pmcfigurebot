caption: Cell communications difference between EMP1 high and low groups. (A) Bar
  plot depicting different interaction numbers and strengths between EMP1 high and
  low groups. (B) Bar plot illustrating the relative and absolute pathway activity
  comparison between EMP1 high and low groups. (C-E) Circle plot presenting the interaction
  difference between EMP1 high and low groups in the whole picture or focusing FN1
  pathway. (F) Heatmap displaying the cell-cell communication difference via FN1 signaling
  pathway.
