caption: ILF3 promoted tumor cell growth in vivo. (A) Images of nude mouse tumorigenesis
  test after four weeks of implantation. Comparison of tumor volume between normal
  diets, high-fat diets, high-fat diets+statin and high-fat diets + ILF3 inhibitor-YM155.
  Tumors in high-fat diet group were bigger than normal diet group. Tumors in statin
  and ILF3 inhibitor-YM-155 groups were smaller than high-fat diet group. (B) Immunohistochemistry
  showed that the expression of ILF3 in normal diets, high-fat diets, high-fat diets+statin
  and high-fat diets + ILF3 inhibitor-YM155 groups. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P
  < 0.0001.
