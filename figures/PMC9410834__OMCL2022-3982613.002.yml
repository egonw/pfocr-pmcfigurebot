caption: 'Regulatory effects of SeNPs on PERK and AMPK signaling pathway in IPEC-J2
  cells exposed to H2O2. (a) The expression level of GRP78 was detected by Western
  blot analysis. (b) The expression levels of PERK, p-PERK, eIF2α, p-eIF2α, ATF4,
  and CHOP were detected by Western blot analysis. (c) The expression level of p-AMPK/AMPK
  was detected by Western blot analysis. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM
  of three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P < 0.001. SeNPs:
  selenium nanoparticles; H2O2: hydrogen peroxide; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1;
  GRP78: glucose-regulated protein 78; PERK: protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum
  kinase; eIF2α: eukaryotic initiation factor 2; ATF4: activating transcription factor
  4; AMPK: AMP-activated kinase.'
