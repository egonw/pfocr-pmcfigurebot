caption: 'The comparison of cell growth and spheroid formation between HCT-116 and
  HT-29 cells after S7333 treatment. Cell morphology and density changes under light
  microscope of HCT-116 (A,B) and HT-29 cells (C,D) before and after treatment with
  S7333 for 72 h at 4 µM. (E), the comparison of live cell numbers between HCT-116
  and HT-29 cells before and after the treatment with S7333. (F,G) show the morphology
  and numbers of tumor spheroids from HCT-116 cells before (F) and after (G) treatment.
  The number of spheroids significantly increased (H) while the size of spheroids
  (average cell numbers/spheroid) significantly decreased (I) after S7333 treatment
  in HCT-116 cells. In HT-29 cells, no morphology (J,K), number (L), and size (M)
  changes were seen before and after S7333 treatment. *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01.'
