caption: 'Differentially expressed genes upon ZIKV PRV infection of JEG3 cells. (A)
  Volcano plot for each time point, colored points indicating differentially expressed
  genes with a p-adjusted value < 0.1 and a log2FoldChange of greater than 0.58 (upregulated,
  orange) or less than 0.58 (downregulated, purple). (B) Overall count of differentially
  expressed genes with the previously mentioned statistics, compared to the total
  data set of 11,697 genes. As indicated by the legend, orange indicates upregulated,
  and purple indicates downregulated. (C) Bedgraphs of two genes that were differentially
  expressed: NPIPA2 (downregulated) and NFX1 (upregulated). Below each bedgraph is
  a map of the gene indicating introns/exons of alternative transcripts and the directionality
  of the gene. Note that PAC-Seq sequences from the poly-A tail or 3′ end of the gene.
  On the right we zoom in to find that there is a trailing off of the reads as they
  get further from the 3′ end, as expected. (D) Scatterplots from Enrichr indicating
  differentially expressed pathways or ontologies. (Enrichr is an online tool made
  available by the Maayan Lab at Mount Sinai). These results suggest that ZIKV infection
  results in the upregulation of mRNA decay, splicing and mRNA processing but downregulation
  of cell cycle control as well as the ERAD pathway and IL-7 interactions.'
