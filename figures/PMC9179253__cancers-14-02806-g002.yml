caption: The mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. The FLT3 signaling pathway
  is activated by dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor, which
  subsequently activates TKD, then PI3/AKT/mTOR signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and
  RAS/MAPK signaling to promote cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.
  FLT3 inhibitors bind to the FLT3 receptor and block this signaling pathway; however,
  FLT3 ligand competes with the receptor binding, and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)
  promotes signaling from another receptor via fibroblast growth factor receptor 1
  (FGFR1). Clones other than AML that proliferate in an FLT3-dependent manner may
  arise as a result of selective pressure by FLT3 inhibitors or clonal evolution during
  FLT3 inhibitor treatment. TKD mutations (lightning sign) or RAS/MAPK signaling-related
  genes mutations (lightnign sign) allow cells to survive without upstream signaling,
  and thus, become drug-resistant. Some acquired TKD mutations also inhibit the binding
  of FLT3 inhibitors to their receptors. The binding of plasma proteins, such as Acid-glycoprotein,
  to FLT3 inhibitors is also known to attenuate the effect of the inhibitors.
