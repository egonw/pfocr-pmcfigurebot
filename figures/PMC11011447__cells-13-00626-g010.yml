caption: 'TEM revealed a keratocyte attachment to the Descemet’s membrane in the Smad4kera-cko
  mouse line. (A–D) Unlike the normal corneal stroma usually have the abundant collagen
  fibrils between the posterior keratocytes and the Descemet’s membrane, due to the
  decrease of the collagen type 1 in the stroma, the keratocytes in Smad4kera-cko
  were noticed to be attached to the Descemet’s membrane (red arrows) in the posterior
  stroma. An abnormal morphology can also be noticed compared to the normal keratocytes.
  Abbreviations: Str, stroma; End, endothelium; Kera, keratocyte; Des, Descemet’s
  membrane.'
