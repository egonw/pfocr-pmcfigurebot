caption: UBE2L3 interacts with and ubiquitinates GSK-3β. (A) GSK-3β levels were determined
  through immunoblotting and qRT-PCR. (B) H1299/UBE2L3 and the control cells were
  treated with 100 μg/ml CHX. The cells were harvested and subjected to immunoblotting
  at different times. Quantification of the UBE2L3 levels, which were normalized to
  GAPDH levels at 0 h. (C, D) 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-GSK-3β and
  myc-UBE2L3 plasmids. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of myc-UBE2L3 and Flag-GSK-3β
  in co-transfected 293T cells. Endogenous UBE2L3 interacted with GSK-3β in H1299
  cells (E) and A549 cells (F). Cells were treated with 20 μM MG132 for 4 h. The cells
  were harvested and subjected to immunoblotting analyses with anti-Ubiquitin antibodies.
  UBE2L3 overexpression dramatically promoted the ubiquitination of GSK-3β in H1299
  cells (G) and A549 cells (H).
