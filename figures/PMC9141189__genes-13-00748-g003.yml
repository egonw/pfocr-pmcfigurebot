caption: 'Gfp levels from Gfp-Atg8 degradation in the bud27Δ mutant seems to reflect
  lower autophagy induction. Upper panel: The wild-type and bud27Δ cultures transformed
  with the pRS315-GFP-ATG8 plasmid were grown to the log phase (OD600~0.6) in SD minimal
  medium at 30 °C. Cells were then shifted to SD (–N) medium for the indicated time
  course. Aliquots were collected for protein extraction at the indicated times, and
  western blots with the anti-Gfp antibody was performed. The anti-Pgk1 antibody was
  used to detect Pgk1 as the internal control. Lower panel: Quantification of western
  blots signals shown in upper panel, corresponding to Gfp/Gfp-Atg8 obtained from
  wild-type and bud27Δ cultures. Graphs represent median and standard deviation of
  two independent biological replicates.'
