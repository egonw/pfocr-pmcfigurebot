caption: 'CAV infection activates cGAS-STING but inhibits IFN-β expression in cells.
  Levels of cGAS, STING, and IFN-β mRNA in MSB1 cells were measured by real-time qPCR
  at the indicated times post-CAV infection, and their mRNA levels were normalized
  to the GAPDH mRNA level in each sample. Data are presented as means ± standard deviations
  from at least three independent experiments; ***P < 0.001, ns: no statistical significance.'
