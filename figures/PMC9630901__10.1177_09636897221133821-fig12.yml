caption: 'Schematic illustration of the underlying mechanism of signaling pathways
  activated after acute TSCI and the effective treatment of HBO-ADMSCs on protecting
  the neurological function via regulating these signaling pathway. TSCI: traumatic
  spinal cord injury; three signaling pathways: (1) cell-stress signaling, (2) pain-facilitated
  signaling, (3) oxidative stress signaling; HBO: hyperbaric oxygen; ADMSC: adipose-derived
  mesenchymal stem cell; TLR: toll-like receptor; TRAF6: tumor necrosis factor receptor
  associated factor 6; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IKK: IÎºB kinase; NF: nuclear factor;
  IL: interleukin; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.'
