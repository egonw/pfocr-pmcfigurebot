caption: SOX4 inhibits preadipocyte determination by activating LEF1 expression(A)
  C3H10T1/2 MSCs stably expressing pLKO.1-Control (Control) or pLKO.1-Sox4 were transiently
  transfected with SuperTOP/FOP flash and β-gal plasmids. The activities of Wnt signaling
  pathway were measured using luciferase assay. SuperFOPflash consists of Wnt-responsive
  elements that are mutants and used as a negative control.(B) SOX4-overexpressing
  C3H10T1/2 MSCs were exposed to 10 μM SB431542 (left) or 100 ng/mL BMP4 (right) and
  the corresponding vehicle. The activities of Wnt signaling pathway in these cells
  were measured by luciferase assay.(C) Protein levels of SOX4 and Wnt components
  were analyzed by Western blotting in pre-differentiated control and SOX4-deficient
  C3H10T1/2 MSCs.(D) Immunofluorescence staining of β-catenin (green) and DAPI (blue)
  in control and SOX4-deficient C3H10T1/2 MSCs. Scale bar, 50 μm.(E) Protein levels
  of LEF1, PPARγ2, and ZFP423 were analyzed by Western blotting in the control and
  LEF1-deficient C3H10T1/2 MSCs. GAPDH was used as a loading control.(F) 2-day post-confluent
  control and LEF1-deficient C3H10T1/2 MSCs were induced to differentiate for 7 days
  and analyzed by Oil Red O staining. Scale bar, 200 μm.(G and H) Relative mRNA levels
  (G) of indicated genes were analyzed by qPCR in pre-differentiated control or SOX4-deficient
  C3H10T1/2 MSCs virally expressing pLV-Control and pLV-Lef1. 2-day post-confluent
  cells were induced to differentiate for 7 days and analyzed by Oil Red O staining
  (H). Scale bar, 200 μm.Data are represented as mean ± SD. ns, no significance, ∗∗p
  < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
