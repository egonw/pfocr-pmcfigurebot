caption: Overview of the expression and screening strategy for the C5 hemiterpene
  diphosphate production in C. reinhardtii. (a) Expression vectors for the fluorescent
  reporters YFP and CFP (V1 and V2, respectively); fusion of the codon-optimized choline
  kinase (CK) and isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK) to the C-terminus (V3) or N-terminus
  (V4) of mCerulean3 and the mVenus reporters in the pOpt_mCerulean3_Paro and pOpt_mVenus_Hyg
  expression vectors; fusion of CK and IPK with YFP or CFP in various arrangements
  (V5, 6, 7, and 8). All constructs in this work were transformed into C. reinhardtii
  strains and recovered under selective antibiotic conditions, as depicted. (b) Microplate
  reader-screened strains expressing fluorescent fusion proteins. Three biological
  replicates were used to calculate the fluorescence intensity averages and the standard
  deviations (SD) in all cases. Statistical significance (one-way ANOVA) compared
  to UVM4 is represented by asterisks (** indicates a difference at the p â‰¤ 0.01 level).
