caption: 'Exercise and trimetazidine (TMZ) effects on nuclear factor erythroid 2 related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway and oxidative stress in high-fat diet (HFD) mouse
  models. (A) Nrf2-mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR. (B, C) Nrf2
  protein expression was determined by western blot. (D, E) Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
  NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) protein expression was determined by western
  blot. (F, G) Represented the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity
  and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, respectively. *,**Represented p<0.05, p<0.01
  in comparison with normal diet (ND) group, respectively; #,##represents p<0.05,
  p<0.01 in comparison with HFD group, respectively. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; HFD+Ex, HFD+exercise group; HFD+TMZ, HFD+TMZ group.'
article_title: Trimetazidine and exercise offer analogous improvements to the skeletal
  muscle insulin resistance of mice through Nrf2 signaling.
