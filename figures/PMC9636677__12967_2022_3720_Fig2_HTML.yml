caption: 'Characterization of exosomes and the effects of radiation on exosomes phagocytosis
  by KYSE150 and ECA109. A The expression of HMGB1 in ESCC cell lines. B Transmission
  electron micrograph of Exos and IR-Exos. C The size distribution and the concentration
  of the exosomes were measured with Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. D Western blotting
  of exosomes and cell lysate proteins was performed to confirm exosome marker proteins
  (CD9, TSG101, HSP70) and calnexin. E, F Changes of HMGB1 protein in KYSE150 and
  ECA09 after GW4869. G DIL (red)-labeled exosomes were co-cultured with KYSE150 and
  ECA109 for 24 h. Then the phagocytosis of exosomes and the HMGB1(green) position
  changes before and after irradiation were observed (DAPI-labeled nuclei were blue,
  magnification, ×600). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; IR: irradiation; HMGB1: high mobility
