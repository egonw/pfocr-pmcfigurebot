figure_title: Pirk-like acts as an essential negative regulator of the IMD pathway
caption: '(A) Immunostaining of WT and Pirk-like-/- mosquito fat bodies that were
  stimulated with PBS or E. cloacae at 12 h PBM and then dissected to measure PGRP-LC
  and Rel2 expressions at 24 h post infection. Scale bar: 20 μm. (B and C) Quantification
  of relative fluorescence intensity of cells shown in (A). Quantification showing
  mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. (D) Heatmap of the 28 shared IMRGs.
  They show the highest abundance among bacteria-infected Pirk-like-/- mosquitoes
  (Pirk-like-/-_Ec) and the lowest among bacteria-infected WT mosquitoes (WT_Ec),
  with an intermediate level of abundance in non-infected Pirk-like-/- mosquitoes
  (Pirk-like-/-_PBS). Non-infected WT mosquitoes (WT_PBS) were used as control. (E)
  Survival rate of Pirk-like-/-, Pirk-like+/- and WT female mosquitoes after E. cloacae
  infection. n = 3 cohorts (total 90 mosquitoes). (F) Survival rate of Pirk-like-/-
  and WT female mosquitoes after infection. Mosquitoes were fed with 1 mM ThT during
  the PBM phase. n = 3 cohorts (total 90 mosquitoes).'
