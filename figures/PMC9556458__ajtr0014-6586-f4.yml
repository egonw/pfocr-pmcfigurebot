caption: ALDOA contributes to cisplatin resistance in GC cells. A. AGS cells (NC vs.
  KD) were treated with cisplatin at the indicated concentrations for 48 hours, and
  the cell viabilities were measured by CCK8 assay (left). B. IC50 of cisplatin for
  AGS cells was presented (right). C. MKN45 cells (VEC vs. OE) were treated with cisplatin
  at the indicated concentrations for 48 hours, and the cell viabilities were measured
  by CCK8 assay (left). D. IC50 of cisplatin for MKN45 cells was presented (right).
