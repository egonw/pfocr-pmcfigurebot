caption: 'Functional analyses of the top five upregulated circular RNAs in Graves’
  disease patients. (A) The significantly enriched terms by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis
  of the top five upregulated circular RNAs in Graves’ disease patients. GO analysis
  is divided into three categories: biological processes, cellular components, and
  molecular functions. (B) The top ten significantly enriched pathways by Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.'
