caption: 'Signaling pathways of nucleic acid-sensing TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9. Nucleic
  acid-sensing TLRs are translated in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently require
  the transmembrane protein UNC93B1 for exit and trafficking via the classical secretory
  pathways to endosomes. On top of UNC93B1, each TLR is associated with additional
  molecules and is transported to designated compartments by individual mechanisms,
  which can vary depending on the cell type (not illustrated). Once in endosomes and
  upon ligand processing and binding to the appropriate TLR, signaling pathways are
  activated: TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 use the MyD88 pathway, whereas TRIF is used in the
  TLR3 signaling. Both MyD88 and TRIF mediate activation of NF-kB and subsequend induction
  of inflammatory cytokine genes. Moreover, MyD88 is responsible for TLR7-, TLR8-
  and TLR9-dependent activation of IRF7, and TRIF for TLR3-dependent activation of
  IRF3, which lead to the induction of type I IFNs.'
