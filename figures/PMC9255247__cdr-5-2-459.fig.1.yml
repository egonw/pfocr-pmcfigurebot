caption: 'Canonical signaling pathway overrepresented in prostate cancer patients
  under ADT. These pathways play a critical role in driving cancer stem-like cell
  phenotype. The red bar represents the genes upregulated and green is downregulated
  and overlaid with IPA database. The X-axis in the graph represents the signaling
  pathways while the Y-axis showed -log (P-value) and percentage (%). ADT: Androgen
  deprivation therapy'
