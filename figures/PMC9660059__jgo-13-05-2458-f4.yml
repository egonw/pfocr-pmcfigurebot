caption: A bioinformatics analysis predicted the relationship between STING and miRNA,
  and between STING and infiltrating immune cells. (A,B) Using the Cytoscape tool,
  we constructed a ceRNA network of STING; mRNA is represented by the orange oval,
  miRNA is represented by the green diamond, and lncRNA is represented by the blue
  rectangle. (C,D) Based on the ENCORI database, the expression of hsa-mir-193b-3p
  and the relationship between the expression of hsa-mir-149-3p and overall survival
  rates were detected. (E) The correlation between STING expression and the infiltration
  of immune cells in COAD in the TIMER database. (F-H) The Pan-Cancer analysis showed
  that STING may be a common oncogene in a variety of cancers. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  and ***P<0.001. STING, stimulator of interferon genes; ceRNA, competing endogenous
  RNA; ENCORI, Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes; COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; TIMER,
  Tumor Immune Estimation Resource; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; RPM, reads per
  million.

  cancer by regulating the AMPK-mTOR pathway.
