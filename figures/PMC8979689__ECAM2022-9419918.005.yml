caption: 'Improvement of LPS-induced memory impairment by folecitin. (a) Effect of
  folecitin on escape latency in the MWM test. (b) Effect of folecitin in the probe
  test (time consumed in the target quadrant on final day of the experiment) showed
  during the MWM test when the immersed platform was removed. (c) Effect of folecitin
  on alternation behaviour in the Y-maze test. Values are presented as the mean ± SEM
  (n = 6 mice per group). C: control, LPS: lipopolysaccharide, F: folecitin, ###P
  < 0.001 as compared to the control group, and ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, and ∗∗∗P <
  0.001 as compared to the LPS group.'
