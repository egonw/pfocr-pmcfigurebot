caption: (A) Venn diagram depicting a comparison of LC-M/MS hits from CM collected
  from 393P Impad1-overexpressing cells, mesenchymal 344SQ scramble control cells,
  and 344SQ shImpad1 cells. See also .(B–E). Masson trichrome staining and second
  harmonic generation microscopy (SHG) detecting collagen in 344SQ vector or Impad1-overexpressing
  syngeneic tumors (B and C) and 344SQ scramble or shImpad1 knockdown syngeneic tumors
  (D and E). Scale bars, 50 μm.See also . Data are represented as mean ± SD. Significance
  by Student’s t test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.002.
