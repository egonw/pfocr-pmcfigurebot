figure_title: The transcriptional profile of BRCA-mut stroma is different than that
  of BRCA-WT stroma
caption: CAF-rich regions of fresh-frozen tumor sections from 7 BRCA-WT and 5 BRCA-mut
  PDAC patients were laser-capture-microdissected and analyzed by RNA-seq. (a) Heatmap
  showing hierarchical clustering of DE genes in CAF-rich regions from BRCA-mut and
  BRCA-WT samples. Pathway analysis was performed using Metascape; Selected significant
  pathways (p < 0.05) are shown (see full list in Supplementary Data ). (b, c) FFPE
  tumor sections from 2 PDAC BRCA-mut patients were stained by IHC for MUC5B and SERPINA1.
  Representative images are shown. Scale bar, 50 μm (d) Human PDAC tissue-derived
  exosomal proteomes (n = 21) and non-tumor adjacent tissue-derived exosomal proteomes
  (n = 16) were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
  Proteins found in >15% of pancreatic cancer exosomes were compared to pancreatic
  adjacent tissue-derived exosomes. Log2 protein expression of the indicated proteins
  is presented. P values were calculated by Welch’s t-test for the comparison of expression
  level and Fisher’s exact test for the comparison of positivity. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM. (e–f) FFPE tumor sections from 9 BRCA-mut and 9 BRCA-WT PDAC patients
  were stained by MxIF using antibodies for the indicated proteins. DAPI was used
  to stain nuclei. Scale bar, 50 μm. Representative images are shown in (e). MUC5B
  and SERPINA1 protein levels were quantified by ImageJ software and the area stained
  by each protein and CAF marker was measured. Quantification of MUC5B colocalization
  with CLU and αSMA was analyzed by two-way ANOVA, and presented as mean ± SEM in
  (f). (g) DE genes were analyzed by Ingenuity software using the causal network tool.
  Schematic representation of the predicted network is presented. Upregulated and
  downregulated genes in BRCA-mut patients are marked in red and blue, respectively;
  predicted regulators are marked in grey. Source data are provided as a Source Data
  file.
