caption: 'Dose–response of tested estrogen-dependent cancer cells. Cells were stimulated
  with: 1 nM estradiol (bar), tested compounds (light violet bars) and tested compounds
  incubated with 1 nM estradiol (dark violet bars) for 72 h. The control is illustrated
  by the black bar. (A) Proliferation of Ishikawa cells was measured by alkaline phosphatase
  activity. (B) Results obtained for MCF-7 cells; their proliferation was evaluated
  by fluorescence-based DNA measurements. The asterisks show a statistically significant
  difference between the control cells and cells stimulated by tested compounds: *
  p < 0.05. The pound symbol shows a statistically significant difference between
  cells incubated with 1 nM estradiol and cells incubated with 1 nM estradiol and
  tested compounds: # p < 0.05.'
