caption: 'Identification of exosomes and bioinformatic analysis of exosomal circular
  RNAs. A: Exosomes were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The scale bar
  is 200 nm; B: Diameter and quantity of the exosomes; C: The positive markers of
  exosomes (CD9, TSG101, and CD81) and the negative marker (Calnexin) were tested
  by Western blot; D: Clustering analysis of circular RNAs (circRNAs); E: Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of cluster 5 of differently expressed circRNAs;
  F: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of cluster 5 of differently expressed circRNAs.
  HD: Healthy donor; GC: Gastric cancer; EGC: Early gastric cancer; LAGC: Locally
  advanced gastric cancer; MGC: Metastatic gastric cancer; AGC: Advanced gastric cancer;
  BP: Biological process; CC: Cell component; MF: Molecular function.'
