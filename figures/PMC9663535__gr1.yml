caption: Characterization of photo-dECM hydrogel. (A) Schematic illustration of the
  fabrication of photo-crosslinkable dECM hydrogel. (B) Histological images of H&E,
  and DAPI staining of ear cartilage tissue before and after decellularization. (C)
  1H NMR spectra of dECMC and dECMC-MA polymers. (D) Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen
  contents before and after decellularization (#p, ∗p ​< ​0.05, compared with the
  native tissue). (E) The statistical analysis of KEEG pathway of dECMC. (F) Rheological
  analysis of photo-dECMC/Col hydrogel (10% w/v, dECMC-MA:ColMA ​= ​1:1). (G) Comparison
  of elastic modulus with different solid contents. (H) Hydrogels degraded in response
  to enzyme solution, such as photo-dECMC hydrogel in hyaluronidase solution (50 U/mL
  in D-PBS), ColMA hydrogel in collagenase solution (50 U/mL in D-PBS), and photo-dECMC/Col
  hydrogel in mixed enzyme solution (50 U/mL hyaluronidase and collagenase in D-PBS).
