caption: NAT10 expression levels in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues and their
  relationship with prognosis. (A) Comparison of NAT10 expression levels in pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma tissues and normal pancreatic tissues from TCGA and GTEx database
  sources; (B) The immunohistochemical staining of NAT10 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
  tissues and normal pancreatic tissues from the human protein atlas database. (C)
  Elevated NAT10 expression in the TCGA dataset predicts poor prognosis associated
  with patients. (D, E) Pathway correlation analysis of NAT10 positively correlates
  with the degree of PI3K-AKT activation and cell proliferation characteristics. (F,
  G) NAT10 positively correlates with TGF-β and angiogenic capacity.
