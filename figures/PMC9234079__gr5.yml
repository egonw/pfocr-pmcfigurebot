caption: Bubble diagram of differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in the top 20
  metabolic pathways. The ordinate shows the names of the metabolic pathways. The
  abscissa is the enrichment factor (rich factor, rich factor = number of significant
  DAMs/number of total metabolites in the pathway). A larger rich factor indicates
  a greater enrichment degree. The color ranging from green to red indicates a decrease
  in the p value. A larger point indicates that more DAMs were enriched in the pathway.
