caption: (a) Enrichment analysis through map folder analysis using MetaCore software,
  performed with the differentially higher abundant proteins in Dsup+ HEK293T cells
  at 24 h recovery after 15 s of UV-C irradiation.  also reports Pathway maps in Folder
  ‘Transcription regulation’ (I), in Folder ‘Protein degradation’ (II), and in Folder
  ‘DNA-damage response’ (III). (b) Enrichment analysis via process networks analysis
  using MetaCore software, performed with the differentially low-abundance proteins
  in Dsup+ HEK293T cells at 24 h recovery after 15 s of UV-C irradiation. Each histogram
  represents an enriched process network associated with its p-value in −log10 and
  its related differential proteins.
