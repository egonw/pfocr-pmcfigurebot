caption: Expression of TRAF6 and lymphatic vessels in colorectal cancer clinical samples.
  (A, B) Representative immunohistochemical staining images for TRAF6 protein and
  D2‐40 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and adjacent normal tissues from a tissue array
  are shown. Magnification, ×40 and ×100. (C) Mean optical density (MOD) showed that
  TRAF6 expression in colorectal cancer tissues was elevated compared with normal
  colorectal tissues. (D) The result of LVD showed that the expression of lymphatic
  vessels in colorectal cancer tissues was elevated compared with normal colorectal
  tissues. (E) Representative immunohistochemical staining images for TRAF6 protein
  in CRC tissues from a tissue array were shown. Magnification, ×100 and ×200. (F)
  The result of immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of relative
  TRAF6 expression levels in N1 and N2 stage colorectal cancer tissues was elevated
  compared with N0. Data are shown as mean ±SD. ***P < 0.001
