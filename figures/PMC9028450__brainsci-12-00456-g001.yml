caption: 'Schematic diagram of the potentially harmful pathway in COVID-19 and Parkinson’s
  disease (PD): (a) the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the brain via the olfactory bulb,
  binding to the ACE receptors. From there, it spreads via non-myelinated nerves into
  the brain. (b) In PD, there are two hypothetical, not yet fully understood, routes
  that the viral pathogen can use to enter the brain, either via the olfactory bulb
  (“brain-first” theory) or via the gastrointestinal mucosa (“body-first” theory),
  spreading into the brain via the vagal nerve.'
