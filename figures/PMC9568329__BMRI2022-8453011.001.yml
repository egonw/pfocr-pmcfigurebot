caption: 'RES promoted apoptosis and inhibited migration and invasion in HeLa cells.
  HeLa cells were treated with or without RES for 24 h (transwell assay) or 48 h (wound
  healing assay); the apoptosis (a and b), migration (c and d), and invasion (e and
  f) were, respectively, analyzed by flow cytometry, wound healing assay, and transwell
  assay. All date was from 3 independent experiments (∗p < 0.05, t-test). Control
  (Ctrl): HeLa cells were treated with DMSO; Resveratrol (RES): HeLa cells were treated
  with resveratrol (RES).'
