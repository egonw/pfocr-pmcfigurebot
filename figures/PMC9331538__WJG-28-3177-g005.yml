caption: 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide promotes events related to the aggressive
  behavior of HCT116 cells through the Met signaling pathway. HCT116 cells were pre-incubated
  with SU11274, a specific Met inhibitor, for 30 min and then treated with or without
  parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP; 10-8M). A: Trypan blue technique showed
  that Met inhibition decreased the cell proliferation induced by PTHrP at 24 h; B:
  Images from wound healing assay show that Met inhibition reverted the wound closure
  promoted by PTHrP at 5 h and 24 h; C: E-cadherin protein levels analyzed by Western
  blot to investigate whether Met is involved in the decrease of this epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) program marker induced by PTHrP in HCT116 cells. Using the Image
  J-NIH program, we performed the analysis of the parameters related to cell morphology.
  The arrows indicate the morphological changes corresponding to the transition from
  a polygonal structure to spindle-like structure related to EMT program progress
  observed when the cells were treated for 24 h with PTHrP or PTHrP plus dimethylsulfoxide
  (DMSO). In all experiments, a control with DMSO, the vehicle of the inhibitor, was
  performed. Graph bars represent the average of the results obtained from two independent
  experiments. DMEM: Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Culture Medium; DMSO: Dimethylsulfoxide;
  EMT: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition; PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide.
  aP < 0.05; bP < 0.01; cP < 0.001.'
