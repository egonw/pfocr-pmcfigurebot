caption: Overexpression of ADAMDEC promotes the proliferation of NSCLC cells. (a)
  The ADAMDEC1 expression in NSCLC cells and human normal lung epithelial cell line
  DEAS‐2B determined by RT‐PCR. (b) WB assay to determine the ADAMDEC1 expression
  in NSCLC cells. (c) ADAMDEC1 mRNA expression in HCC827 and NCI‐H1299 cells transfected
  with pcDNA4.0 vector, pcDNA4.0‐ ADAMDEC1 vector, CTRL‐shRNA, or ADAMDEC1‐shRNA were
  determined by RT‐qPCR. (d) ADAMDEC1 protein expression in HCC827 and NCI‐H1299 cells
  transfected with indicated vectors, which divided into five groups, including CTRL,
  OE‐NC, OE‐ADAMDEC1, shCTRL and shADAMDEC1. (e) Representative images from HCC827
  and NCI‐H1299 cells transfected with aforementioned vectors or shRNAs stained for
  ADAMDEC1 (green); nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). (f) CCK8 assay was
  used to compare the cell proliferation of CTRL, OE‐NC, OE‐ ADAMDEC1, shCTRL and
  sh ADAMDEC1 groups in HCC827 and NCI‐H1299 cells. CTRL, negative control, OE, overexpression.
  Data represent mean values ± SD from three replicates of each sample. **p < 0.01;
  ***p < 0.001
