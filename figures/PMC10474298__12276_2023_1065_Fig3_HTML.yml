figure_title: VPA-exposed mice show increased Rnf146 expression
caption: a Representative western blot results. Ctrl, vehicle-exposed control mice;
  VPA, VPA-exposed mice. b VPA-exposed mice showed significantly increased Rnf146
  levels compared to control mice (n = 14 mice for control, n = 13 mice for VPA, two-tailed
  unpaired t test; t25 = 2.283, *P = 0.0312). Rnf146 expression levels were normalized
  to tubulin levels. c VPA-exposed mice showed significantly decreased p-β-catenin
  levels, which were normalized to β-catenin levels, compared to control mice (n = 14
  mice for control, n = 13 mice for VPA, two-tailed unpaired t test; t25 = 2.519,
  *P = 0.0185). d VPA-exposed mice showed comparable β-catenin levels, which were
  normalized to tubulin levels, when compared to control mice (n = 14 mice for control,
  n = 13 mice for VPA, two-tailed unpaired t test; t25 = 1.456, P = 0.1577).
