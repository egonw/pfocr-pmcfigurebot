caption: 'SAG reversed the senescence degree of the placentas and PMSCs in the LPS-induced
  rats. (a) Western blot analysis of TLR4, SMO, and Gli1 protein expression and quantitative
  analysis of TLR4, SMO, and Gli1 in different groups of placentas. (b) Western blot
  analysis and densitometric quantification of p16 and p53 protein expressions in
  different groups of placentas. (c) SA-β-gal staining of the placentas of different
  groups of rats. (d) Morphology of rat PMSCs. Small fibroblast- like MSC colonies
  were detected by an inverted microscope. (e) Successfully differentiated PMSCs of
  rats were stained with Alizarin Red for osteogenic differentiation, Oil Red O for
  adipocytes, and alcian blue, in which red calcium nodules, orange lipid droplets,
  and blue cartilage could be observed. (f) PMSCs of rats expressed CD90 but not CD45.
  (g) Western blot analysis of TLR4, SMO, and Gli1 protein expression and quantitative
  analysis of TLR4, SMO, and Gli1 in different groups of PMSCs. (h) Western blot analysis
  and densitometric quantification of p16 and p53 protein expressions in different
  groups of placentas. (i) SA-β-gal staining of different groups of rat PMSCs and
  the average ratio of SA-β-Gal-positive cells in different groups of PMSCs. (j) ELISA
  analysis of MMP9 concentrations of cell culture medium in different groups of PMSCs.
  (k) ELISA analysis of sFlt-1 concentrations of cell culture medium in different
  groups of PMSCs. Scale bar: 200 μm. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ∗P < 0.05,
  ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 by Student''s t-test. SD: Standard
  deviation.'
