caption: 'EGCG metabolite profile in human plasma after oral ingestion of catechin-rich
  tea. (A) Representative extracted ion chromatogram of EGCG metabolites from human
  plasma collected 2 h after ingestion of 615 mg of extracted catechin (135 mg of
  EGCG). Each chromatogram represents the detection of EGCG or its metabolites: m/z
  457 for free (E)GCG, m/z 537 for (E)GCG-sulfate, m/z 471 for (E)GCG-methyl, m/z
  551 for (E)GCG-methyl-sulfate, m/z 633 for (E)GCG-glucuronide, and m/z 565 for (E)GCg-dimethyl-sulfate.
  (B) MS/MS spectrum of EGCG-sulfate. (C) MS/MS spectrum of (E)GCg-diMe-sulfate.'
