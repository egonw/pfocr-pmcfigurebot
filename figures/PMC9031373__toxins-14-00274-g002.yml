caption: 'From Jhawar S et al. PLoS ONE 10(3): e0118703.Fig 5. The expression of genes
  in the TGF receptor pathway identified by Pavlidis Template Matching [] in the DAVID
  data base [] and subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [,]. The 10 uremic
  patients were dichotomized into those without RRF (n = 5) on the left and those
  with RF (n = 5) on the right. The GSEA enrichment score curve (top panel) for TGF-beta
  receptor signaling (34 genes), indicates 10 genes as core-enriched (mapped on ranked
  list left of the peak on the enrichment score curve). The activation of these 10
  genes was greater following incubation in pre- and post-dialysis (Pre-Dial, Post-Dial)
  plasma of subjects without RRF than in subjects with RRF (bottom panels, red in
  heat map = high mRNA abundance, blue = low abundance).'
