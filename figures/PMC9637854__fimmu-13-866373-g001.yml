caption: The absence of IL4R/IL5 signaling promotes filarial survival and production
  of microfilaria. WT and Il-4rα-/-/Il-5-/- BALB/c mice were infected with L. sigmodontis
  and parasitic load was determined at 50 and 70 days post infection (dpi). (A) Number
  of adult worms in the pleural cavity; results are expressed as mean ± SEM. n=9 WT
  and n=9 Il-4rα-/-/Il-5-/- mice at 50 dpi and n=24 WT and n=24 Il-4rα-/-/Il-5-/-
  mice at 70 dpi, pool of 1-3 experiments. (B) Number of microfilariae (Mfs) in pleural
  cavity fluid (n=8 per group of mice), in peripheral blood (n=24 per group of mice),
  in cardiac blood (n=24 per group of mice), in pulmonary flush (n=8 per group of
  mice) and in the whole lung tissue (n=5 per group of mice). For each location a
  t-test was performed $p<0.05, $$p<0.01 and $$$p<0.001 represent differences between
  WT and Il-4rα-/-/Il-5-/- mice.
