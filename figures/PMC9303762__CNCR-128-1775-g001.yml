caption: Cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) was identified as the downstream target
  gene of microRNA 513c‐5p (miR‐513c‐5p). (A) A bioinformatics query of miR513c‐5p
  expression in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) tissues is illustrated. (B)
  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was used to verify the expression of miR513c‐5p
  in TSCC tissues. (C) Results of a dual luciferase (Luc) reporter experiment are
  illustrated. Mut indicates mutation; NC, negative control; Rluc, Renilla luciferin;
  WT, wild type. (D,E) PCR was used to detect miR513c‐5p and CDK5 expression in TSCC
  cells transfected with miR513c‐5p mimics. (F) Western blot analysis was used to
  detect CDK5 and cell division cycle 25B (CDC25B) protein expression in TSCC cells
  transfected with miR513c‐5p mimics. (G) Cholecystokinin‐8 (CCK8) assays were performed
  to detect the effect of miR513c‐5p on the growth of TSCC cells. OD 450 indicates
  an optical density of 450 nm. (H) Flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of
  miR513c‐5p on the cell cycle of SCC25 cells. PI‐A indicates propidium iodide assay.
  (I) The miR513c‐5p mimics and a CDK5 overexpression lentivirus were simultaneously
  transfected into SCC15 cells that were used for CCK8 assays. (J) Western blot analysis
  was performed to detect the levels of CDK5 and CDC25B proteins in SCC15 cells that
  had been transfected with miR513c‐5p mimics and the CDK5 overexpression lentivirus
  separately or at the same time. All data points represent mean ± standard deviation
  values. A single asterisk indicates P < .05; double asterisks, P < .01.

  carcinoma through the microRNA 513c‐5p/cell division cycle 25B pathway and is associated
  with a poor prognosis.
