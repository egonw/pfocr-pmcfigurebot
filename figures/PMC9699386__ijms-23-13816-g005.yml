caption: 'Schematic representing the interplay between ET-1/ETA/ETB receptor and mTOR
  signaling under HG conditions in H9c2 cells. HG treatment leads to increased production
  of ROS, mitochondrial damage, decreased expression of survival markers, and increased
  expression of apoptosis markers. These HG-induced cardiomyocyte damages were ameliorated
  by inhibition of endothelin receptors ETA-R alone, both ETA-R/ETB-R, or partial
  suppression of mTOR complex. HG: High glucose; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; ET-1:
  Endothelin-1; siRap: silencing Raptor; siRic: silencing Rictor.'
