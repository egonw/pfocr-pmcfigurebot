caption: TLR agonist-induced augmentation of antimicrobial capacity is blocked in
  MyD88-KO, but not TRIF-KO, macrophages. (A, B) Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment
  analysis was conducted for immunology-related pathways and displayed by significance
  of pathway induction (A) and by dot plot which shows number of genes differentially
  regulated in each respective pathway (i.e. “count”) by dot size and degree of significance
  (padj) by intensity of color (B). (C) Immune function-related GO pathways were evaluated
  by heat map comparing MPLA-trained WT, MyD88-KO (MKO), and TRIF-KO (TKO) BMDMs to
  unstimulated (US) genotype controls. (D-F) Relative gene expression of MARCO (D),
  PECAM1 (E) and Ptprm (F) of unstimulated control, MPLA, CpG, and Poly I:C-treated
  WT, MKO, and TKO BMDMs 3 days post-treatment (n=2-3 biological replicates/group).
  (G, H) The fluorescence emitted upon phagocytosis of pHrodo-tagged S. aureus bioparticles
  was measured over 4 hours (G) and peak phagocytosis was analyzed (H). (I) ROS production
  was assessed by flow cytometry. (J) Phagocytic capacity of MPLA-, CpG-, and Poly
  I:C-treated WT, MyD88-KO, and TRIF-KO were assessed alongside unstimulated (US)
  genotype controls. (K) Bacterial killing (S. aureus MOI 10) of MPLA-treated WT,
  MyD88-KO, and TRIF-KO BMDMs compared to US controls. (L) ROS production capacity
  was assessed. Data are shown as mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ***p < 0.0001, ****p < 0.0001 by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc multiple comparison
  test.
