caption: NRF2 expression was enhanced in association with ERα upregulation upon bicalutamide
  treatment in PCa cells. LNCaP and LNCaP abl cells were treated with 30 μM bicalutamide
  for 7 days, and LNCaP abl cells were exposed to 10 nM 17β-oestradiol (E2). A GSEA
  plot of ROS pathway gene set activity in PCa cells from mRNA-seq data. B The protein
  levels of ERα and NRF2 were analysed. C, D The mRNA levels of ERα, NRF2, AR, and
  NRF2 target genes were analysed in LNCaP (t test) and LNCaP abl (one-way ANOVA)
  cells. E Representative graphs of ERα and NRF2 immunofluorescence data in LNCaP
  cells before and after bicalutamide treatment; scale bar, 50 μm. F mRNA levels of
  ERα, NRF2, and its target genes in LNCaP cells and LNCaP abl cells exposed to bicalutamide
  and tamoxifen (one-way ANOVA). G mRNA and protein levels of ERα, NRF2 and NRF2 target
  genes in LNCaP and LNCaP abl cells treated with DMSO or 10 nM E2 (t test). All studies
  were repeated at least three times; the values are presented as the means ± SEMs;
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
