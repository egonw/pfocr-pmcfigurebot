caption: 'ASPS affected the genes related to p38 MAPK signaling pathway. (a,b) Survival
  curve of PA14-infected skn-1 mutant and atf-7 mutant. (c,d) The expression of genes
  encoding p38 MAPK pathway and pmk-1 targeted genes. n = 3. Significant difference
  from the control group was designated as ** p < 0.01, and significant difference
  from the radiation group was designated as ##p < 0.01, respectively.'
