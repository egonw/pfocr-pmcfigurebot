caption: Oral wound healing is accelerated in Med1epi−/− mice. (A) Representative
  macroscopic views of oral wounds on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after injury in control
  and MED1 null mice. The yellow dotted circles indicate the initial position of the
  wound. Trauma locations are indicated with white arrows, (B) Evaluation of open
  wound area by morphometrical analysis of the wound areas. n = number of measurements,
  (C) Representative histological view of oral mucosal re-epithelialization. Black
  dotted lines indicate the distance between the edges of the epithelium, (D) The
  distance between wound margins. Scale bar = 500 μm. Bars = means ± SD. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01.*** p < 0.001.
