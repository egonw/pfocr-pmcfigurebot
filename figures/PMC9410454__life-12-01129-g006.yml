caption: Knockdown of CIRBP inhibits the PINK1/Parkin pathway. (a) The influence of
  the knockdown of CIRBP on the protein expression of PINK1 and Parkin in the mitochondria
  of A549R. (b) The influence of the knockdown of CIRBP on the proteins PINK1 and
  Parkin in the whole cells of A549R. (c) The influence of the knockdown of CIRBP
  on PINK1 mRNA in A549R cells. (d) The influence of the knockdown of CIRBP on the
  accumulation of PINK1 in mitochondria (Ã—10). * p < 0.05 between the indicated groups.
