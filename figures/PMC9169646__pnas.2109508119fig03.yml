caption: CHD-7 functions in the TGF-β signaling pathway. (A and B) Loss of chd-7 suppresses
  dauer arrest of TGF-β pathway mutants at 25 °C but not 26.5 °C. Seven L4s were plated
  individually and grown at the specified temperature for 1 wk when arrested and nonarrested
  progeny were scored. Bars and horizontal black lines represent mean percentage with
  SD. Statistical significance was calculated using χ2 test with Bonferroni correction
  for multiple comparisons. ****,††††P < 0.0001 and £££P < 0.001. (A) Quantification
  of dauer arrest in chd-7;daf-7(e1372) mutants. The asterisks represent comparison
  to daf-7(e1372) grown at 25 °C and the daggers represent comparison to daf-7(e1372)
  at 26.5 °C. (B) Dauer arrest in TGF-β pathway mutant backgrounds. The asterisks
  represent comparison to daf-1(m213) grown at 25 °C, and the daggers represent comparison
  to daf-14(m77) at 25 °C; the pound symbols represent comparison to daf-1(m213) at
  26.5 °C. (C) High temperature chd-7(gk290);daf-7(e1372) dauers are surrounded by
  undetached cuticle. (Left) Representative DIC photomicrographs of dauers grown at
  26.5 °C for 1 wk. (Upper Right) Quantification of the population of animals with
  undetached cuticle. Two biological replicates were scored (n > 398/replicate). (Lower
  Right) chd-7(gk290);daf-7(e1372) develop as SDS-sensitive dauer larvae at 26.5 °C.
  n > 667 animals per strain tested. Bars and horizontal black lines represent mean
  percentage with SD. Statistical analysis was calculated using two-tailed unpaired
  t test. ****P < 0.0001. (D) chd-7 regulates body size. Body length of day 1 adults
  at 20 °C (n > 16). One-way ANOVA, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 compared to wild-type,
  N2 strain. (E) chd-7(tm6139) males do not mate. Eight males from each strain tested
  were plated with four fog-2 females on 10-cm plates. After 24 h, fog-2 females were
  transferred to new plates and within 48 h the proportion of fertile females were
  scored. The assay was repeated twice. (F) Relative mRNA levels of genes from the
  DBL-1/BMP and DAF-7/TGF-β pathways in chd-(tm6139) or N2 L4s determined by qRT-PCR.
  Error bars indicate SE from three biological repeats. cdc-42 was used as housekeeping
  gene. Statistical significance was calculated using t test for multiple comparisons.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
