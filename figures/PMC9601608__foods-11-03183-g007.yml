caption: 'Phycocyanin increases the activity of the AKT and AMPK pathway in insulin-resistant
  SMMC-7721 cells. (A) Western blot analysis of the AKT signaling pathway in the N1,
  N2, Y1, and Y2 groups. (B) Western blot analysis of the expressions of the AMPKÎ±
  and IRS proteins in the N1, N2, Y1, and Y2 groups. * (p < 0.05) represent groups
  with significant differences compared with the N1 group. # (p < 0.05) and ## (p
  < 0.01) represent groups with significant differences compared with the Y1 group.
  N1 represents control cells, N2 represents control cells with phycocyanin treatment,
  Y1 represents insulin-resistant cells, and Y2 represents insulin-resistant cells
  with phycocyanin treatment.'
