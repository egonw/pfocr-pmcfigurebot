caption: 'Effect of BSJPQYF on PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, NF-κB, p-NF-κB, TNF-α, and cleaved
  caspase-3 in BMSCs of mice. Groups from left to right, respectively: control group,
  model group, low dose (0.85 g/mL BSJPQYF) group, and high dose (1.7 g/mL BSJPQYF)
  group. (a) Protein bands of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, NF-κB, p-NF-κB, and TNF-α. (b) Quantitative
  analysis of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, NF-κB, p-NF-κB, and TNF-α expression alteration in
  BMSCs of mice. (c) Protein band of cleaved caspase-3. (d) Quantitative analysis
  of cleaved caspase-3 expression alteration in BMSCs of mice. Data are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). ∗∗P < 0.01 versus the control group; ##P <
  0.01 versus the model group.'
