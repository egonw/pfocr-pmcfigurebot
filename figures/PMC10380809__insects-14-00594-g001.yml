caption: Signaling network of the insect immune system to modulate AMP and ROS production
  in the midgut of Drosophila melanogaster in the presence of a low microbial load
  (A) and a high microbial load (B). Red lines and green lines indicate active pathways,
  where the green lines indicate activation and the red lines indicate inhibition.
  The thickness of the line indicates the strength of the signal. AMPs, antimicrobial
  peptides; Atf2, activating transcription factor 2; CanB, calcineurin B; Cad99c,
  cadherin 99c; DAP-PGN, diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycan; Duox, dual oxidase;
  Gαq, G protein αq subunit; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; IKK, IκB kinase; IMD,
  immune deficiency; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; MEKK1, MAPK and ERK kinase
  1; MKK3, MAPK kinase 3; Mkp3, MAP kinase phosphatase-3; p38, p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway; PGRPs, peptidoglycan recognition proteins; PIMS/Pirk, PGRP-LC-interacting
  inhibitors of IMD signaling; PKC, protein kinase C; PLCβ, phospholipase C-β; PM,
  peritrophic matrix; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TAK1, transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase 1.
