caption: A generalized schematic representation of salt stress in plants leading to
  ionic and osmotic stress and the resulting tolerance mechanisms including the SOS
  signaling pathway, ionic homeostasis, osmotic adjustment, the production of metabolites
  and compatible solutes, rhizosphere microbial activities, and the production of
  phytohormones to alleviate various stresses, especially salt stress in plants.
