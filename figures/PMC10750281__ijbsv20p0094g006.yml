caption: Expression of G3BP1, JAK2 and p-STAT3 predicted overall survival of patients
  with NPC. (A) Weak positive expression of G3BP1, JAK2 and p-STAT3 were indicated
  in the columnar epithelial cells of non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissue; stronger
  positive expression of G3BP1, JAK2 and p-STAT3 were indicated in NPC tissues with
  the enhanced clinical stages. (B) The statistical analysis of positive rates of
  expression of G3BP1, JAK2 and p-STAT3 independently and commonly. (C) The overall
  survival rates were significantly lower for NPC patients with positive expression
  of G3BP1, JAK2 and p-STAT3 independently and commonly, as well as higher T stages,
  N stages and clinical stages. (D) Representative image and statistical analysis
  of IHC staining of G3BP1 in pairwise primary and recurrent tumors. (E) Representative
  image and statistical analysis of IHC staining of G3BP1 in pairwise primary and
  metastasis tumors. (F) Schematic representation of molecular mechanism of G3BP1
  in promoting tumor growth and metastasis.
