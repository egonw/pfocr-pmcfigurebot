figure_title: HvCMF4 may regulate spikelet growth via the light signaling pathway
  that entrains the circadian clock
caption: (A) Two enriched motifs from the HvCMF4-coexpressed cluster (C8). (B) ISH
  of barley PPD-H1, CCA1, and PIF3 orthologs in spike transverse sections at W5.5
  stage. Scale bars, 50 μm. (C) Venn diagrams showing overlaps of barley orthologs
  of Arabidopsis CCA1–targeted, PIF-, and HY5-regulated genes with HvCMF4-regulated
  genes from spike sections. P values are defined on the basis of Fisher’s exact test.
  (D) Effect of day length on potential (P.) spikelet number, final (F.) spikelet
  number, and grain number variations. Data are shown as means ± SEM, n = 6. The significance
  of genotype (G) × environment (E) interaction is determined by ANOVA.
