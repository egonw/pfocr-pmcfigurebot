caption: UDP‐GlcUA enhances TGFβR1 mRNA binding of PTBP3. (A) DARTS assays with pronase
  digestion in Huh7 cells upon UDP‐GlcUA treatment. (B) Cellular thermal shift assay
  curves for PTBP3 in cell lysates supplemented with or without UDP‐GlcUA. Proteins
  denatured at the indicated temperature were probed with anti‐PTBP3, with GAPDH as
  a loading control. The bands were quantified using the Image‐Pro Plus analyzer software
  and normalized to the protein level of PTBP3 detected at 37°C (n = 3). (C) Conserved
  consensus PTBP3 response element (PRE). (D) Schematic drawing of two predicted consensus
  PTB response elements (PREs) in TGFβR1 mRNA 3′‐UTR. WT for wild‐type, Mut 1 for
  PRE1 mutation, Mut 2 for PRE2 mutation, Mut 1 and Mut 2 for combo mutation. (E)
  Relative luciferase activities in Huh7 cells with or without PTBP3 depletion (n = 3
  independent experiments). (F) Relative luciferase activities in Huh7 cells transfected
  with 3′‐UTR segments containing wild type (WT) or PRE‐1/2 mutants upon UDP‐GlcUA
  supplementation. (G–I) Streptavidin agarose affinity pull‐down assay using biotin‐PRE1
  as a probe (G) in Huh7 cells with UDP‐glucose 6‐dehydrogenase (UGDH) depletion (H)
  or supplemented with UDP‐GlcUA (I). PRE1‐Mut served as a negative control. (J) Streptavidin
  agarose affinity pull‐down assay using biotin‐PREs (1 μg) as a probe by mixing purified
  recombinant His‐RRM3/4 (5 μg) and increasing doses of UDP‐GlcUA. Data are mean ± SD.
  p‐Values were derived from an unpaired, two‐tailed Student's t‐test in (B and E–F)
  (*p < .01, ***p < .001).
