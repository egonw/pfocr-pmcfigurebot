caption: MVA volatile clustering based on correlation types and connectivity. (a)
  HCA and heat map analysis of the volatiles derived from the MVA pathway. (b) MVA
  volatiles were grouped into three clusters based on their correlations and connectivity.
  The red dashed lines represent a significant positive correlation; the black dashed
  lines represent a significant negative correlation; (c) proposed sesquiterpene volatile
  synthesis pathway.
