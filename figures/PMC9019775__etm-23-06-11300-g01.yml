caption: RUT suppresses LPS-triggered inflammatory response and oxidative stress in
  BEAS-2B cells. (A) Levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in RUT-treated cells induced
  by LPS. (B) MDA levels, and the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in RUT-treated cells
  induced by LPS. Results are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001. GSH-Px,
  glutathione peroxidase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; RUT, rutaecarpine;
  SOD, superoxide dismutase.
article_title: Rutaecarpine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced BEAS-2B cell injury
  through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the AMPK/SIRT1
  signaling pathway.
