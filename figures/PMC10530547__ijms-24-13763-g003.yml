caption: 'AML—Lnc RNAs, miRs, and circular RNAs regulate Zbtb20 levels in AML; breast
  cancers, similar to AML, are regulated by a myriad of non-coding RNAs. GAC—Zbtb20
  expression is increased during inflammation and is involved in the induction of
  the proinflammatory NF-kB pathway. Increased activity and synthesis of MMPs, necessary
  for migration, is most likely a result of the NF-kB activation. GBM—miRs help suppress
  Zbtb20. HCC—regulatory pathway through FOXO1 is also present in HCC. An alternative
  HCC phenotype is possible through CUX1 signaling with concomitant Zbtb20 repression.
  NSCLC—Zbtb20 can influence proliferation through the FOXO1 pathway. Inflammation
  seems to upregulate Zbtb20 expression here as well. Liver regeneration—Zbtb20 facilitates
  EGFR induction which is found in some HHC. Abbreviations: AML, acute myeloid leukemia;
  GAC, gastric adenocarcinoma; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;
  Lnc RNAs, long noncoding RNAs; NSCLC, non-small-cell lung carcinoma.'
