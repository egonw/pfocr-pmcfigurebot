figure_title: Adenosine evokes KATP currents in cECs and pericytes through the A2AR
  and PKA signaling pathway
caption: (A) Schematic diagram illustrating how A2AR signaling through the Gαs-AC-PKA
  intracellular pathway activates KATP channels. The A2AR and PKA agonists or antagonists
  used are indicated. (B) Representative recordings showing the effects of adenosine
  (ADO; 25 μM) on glibenclamide (GLIB; 10 μM)–sensitive currents from native cECs
  (n = 7 cells) and pericytes (n = 7 cells). (C) Effects of the metabolically stable
  adenosine analog 2-chloroadenosine (CADO; 5 μM) on GLIB-sensitive currents in cECs
  (n = 9 cells) and pericytes (n = 6 cells per group). (D) Effects of the adenosine
  A2 receptor agonist CGS-21680 (CGS; 500 nM) on GLIB-sensitive currents evoked by
  in cECs (n = 8 cells) and pericytes (n = 7 cells). (E) Summary data showing the
  averaged GLIB-sensitive current density induced by ADO (25 μM), CADO (5 μM), and
  CGS-21680 (500 nM) in cECs and pericytes. (F) Original traces and summary data showing
  the effects of adenosine (25 μM) and pinacidil (PIN; 10 μM) in cECs (n = 8 cells;
  top) and pericytes (n = 8 cells; bottom) treated with the A2AR blocker ZM-241385
  (30 nM). (G) Effects of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (1 μM) or PIN on GLIB-sensitive KATP
  currents induced by ADO or CSG-21680 in cECs (n = 7 cells) and pericytes (n = 7
  cells). External K+ was 60 mM, and cells were dialyzed with 0.1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM ADP,
  and 140 mM K+. Membrane current was recorded at a VM of −70 mV. Dotted line represents
  zero current level. Data are presented as means ± SEM (★P < 0.05; ★★P < 0.01; ★★★P
  < 0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunn’s test).
