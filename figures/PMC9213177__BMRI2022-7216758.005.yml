caption: Involvement of HER2-miR1 in Wnt signaling pathway regulation. (a) Accumulation
  of HER2-miR1 in SW480 cells overexpressing preHER2-miR1. (b) Shows significant Wnt
  signaling downregulation following HER2-miR1 overexpression. Relative luciferase
  activity was measured in SW480 cells which were cotransfected with TOP-flash vector
  along with preHER2-miR1 overexpressing vector or mock and scrambled control vectors.
  Error bars indicate SD of triplicated experiments, P < 0.05. (c) Shows the upregulation
  of the APC1 and APC2 genes and downregulation of c-Myc, following HER2-miR1 overexpression
  in SW480 cell line. Error bars indicate SD of duplicated experiments, P < 0.05.
  (d) Shows HER2-miR1 overexpression along with PNU-4654 and XAV-939 small molecules
  effects on APC1, APC2, and c-Myc gene expression. Error bars indicate SD of duplicated
  experiments, P < 0.05.
