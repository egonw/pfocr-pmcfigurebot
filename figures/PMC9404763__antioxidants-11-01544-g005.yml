caption: Platinum sensitive HGSOC cells (left) display higher levels of cytoplasmic
  GSH, which has been proposed as the main cytoplasmic target of cisplatin (CDDP)
  that can enter the cell through passive diffusion via the copper transporter. CDDP
  treatment causes accumulation of ROS in both the cytosolic compartment and the mitochondria,
  in which GSH is normally imported through the oxoglutarate carrier (OGC)/SLC25A11.
  Platinum resistant clones (right) evade this pathway by downregulating xCT and/or
  the enzymes involved in GSH synthesis and recycling. GSH levels decrease and, as
  a compensatory mechanism, platinum resistant HGSOC cells have higher thioredoxin
  reductase (TXNRD1).
