caption: 'Identification of molecules decreasing the effects of CYS4 overexpression
  (CYS4-OE) in yeast. (A) Simplified representation of the trans-sulphuration pathway.
  In yeast, CYS4 encodes the cystathionine beta synthase protein (CBS or Cys4p in
  yeast), which converts homocysteine and serine into cystathionine. The other enzymes
  of this pathway are cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase
  (GCL) and glutathione synthetase (GS). CYS4 is located at a metabolic hub, its deletion
  leading to decreased synthesis of cysteine and glutathione in favour of S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and methionine synthesis, whereas CYS4-OE favours
  cysteine and glutathione synthesis at the expense of methionine. (B) Methionine
  auxotrophy of CYS4-OE cells. Methionine auxotrophy, revealed by the absence of growth
  on a methionine-free medium, was assessed by spotting serial dilutions of wildtype
  yeast cells transformed with two 2µ plasmids either empty or containing full-length
  (CYS4-FL) or a truncated form of CYS4 (CYS4-ΔC), the expression of which is driven
  by the strong GPD promoter. No serine was added here in order to see the increased
  methionine auxotrophy obtained with CYS4-ΔC compared to CYS4-FL. (C) Clioquinol
  (CQ) and chloroxine (CHX) rescue the growth of CYS4-OE yeast cells on a methionine-free
  medium. The indicated amount of drug was added on filters. The positive action of
  the drugs on cell growth is indicated by the presence of a clear halo surrounding
  the filters where the molecules were deposited. Due to the gradient effect of the
  drug deposited on filters, note that these two molecules are toxic at very high
  concentrations (dark halos around the filters) but are active at lower concentrations
  (white halos corresponding to the rescue of cell growth). (D–F) Effect of CYS4 deletion
  or OE on cytosolic pH assessed using a pHluorin plasmid. Quantitative measurements
  of the I410/I470 ratio of fluorescence showed an increased ratio for cys4Δ cells
  (D), indicative of an increased cytosolic pH and a decreased ratio of fluorescence
  for wildtype cells overexpressing either form of Cys4p (full-length or C-terminal
  domain deleted) (E), indicative of reduced cytosolic pH. Addition of 1.5 mM of serine
  in the medium of CYS4-OE cells also further decreased cytosolic pH (F), showing
  the existence of a direct link between Cys4p enzymatic activity and cytosolic acidification.
  (G,H) Dose-dependent rescue of cytosolic acidification of CYS4-OE cells by CQ (G)
  and CHX (H). Note that at 1 µM, CQ and CHX even increased cytosolic pH above the
  level of control cells, which is probably the result of their pro-oxidant effect
  in certain growth conditions, which may partly deplete intracellular glutathione
  and/or inhibit endogenous Cys4p. (I) Nitroxoline (NHX) rescues the growth of CYS4-OE
  yeast cells on a methionine-free medium. Note that NHX was toxic at 10 nmol. (D)
  Student’s t-test. (E,F) One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. (G,H): Comparison
  of each condition with DMSO, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc test. *, p <
  0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001.'
