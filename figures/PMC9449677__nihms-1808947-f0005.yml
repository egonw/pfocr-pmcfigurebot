figure_title: Pathway analysis demonstrates activation of type I and II interferon
  (IFN) pathways in SCLC mouse tumors treated with AZD1775 or AZD1775 plus anti-PD-L1
  antibody, and AZD1775 mediates STAT1 pathway activation in SCLC cells
caption: (A and B) HALLMARK pathway enrichment analyses of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) from RPP tumors on the mice treated with vehicle, AZD1775, or AZD1775
  plus anti-PD-L1 antibody for 21 days. (A) AZD1775 versus vehicle and (B) AZD1775
  plus anti-PD-L1 antibody versus vehicle (n = 5 per group).(C and D) HALLMARK pathway
  enrichment analyses of DEGs from RPM tumors on the mice treated with vehicle, AZD1775,
  or AZD1775 plus anti-PD-L1 antibody for 18 days. (C) AZD1775 versus vehicle and
  (D) AZD1775 plus anti-PD-L1 antibody versus vehicle (n = 4 per group).(E) Quantitative
  mRNA expression of IFN-γ after treatment with 1 μM of AZD1775 for 48 h in SCLC cells
  (H526, H82, H446, RPP, and RPM cells). The data shown represent the means ± SD of
  triplicate. p values were calculated by Student’s t test (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).(F)
  Western blots show expression of p-WEE1, p- and total STAT1, and actin (loading
  control) in SCLC cells (H526, H82, H446). Cells were treated with 1 μM AZD1775 for
  24 h.(G) Quantitative mRNA expression of IRF1 after treatment with 1 μM AZD1775
  for 48 h in SCLC cells (H82, H446). The data shown represent the means ± SD of triplicate.
  p values were calculated by Student’s t test (*p < 0.05).See also .
