caption: Mechanism of FA and its derivatives inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.
  FA can inhibit cell proliferation by increasing the gene expression of TP53 and
  decreasing the gene expression of CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, thereby leading to cell
  cycle arrest. It also reduces the expression levels of IL-4, PDGF, and GM-CSF and
  the phosphorylation level of JAK2/STAT6 and inhibits the JAK2/STAT6 signaling pathway
  to suppress cell proliferation and metastasis. FA inhibits casein kinase 2 (CK2)-induced
  phosphorylation of tyrosinase, thereby inhibiting the activation of NF-κB. FA reduces
  the phosphorylation of Akt and PI3K and inhibits the activation of the PI3K/AKT
  pathway. PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, AKT protein kinase B, mTOR mammalian
  target of rapamycin, TP53 tumor protein 53, CDK cyclin-dependent kinases, JAK Janus
  kinase, STAT signal transduction and transcriptional activator, TNF-α tumor necrosis
  factor-α, Bax Bcl-2-associated X, PCNA proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PDGF
