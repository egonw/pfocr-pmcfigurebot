caption: MAP3K4 inactivation disrupts activation of specific pathways downstream of
  the IGF1R and IR.A–F, insulin does not stimulate MAPK signaling in TS cells. Phosphorylation
  of p38 and JNK is reduced in TSKI cells relative to TSWT cells regardless of insulin
  stimulation. Phosphorylated JNK bands are labeled bands a, b, and c. B–F, densitometry
  of Western blots detecting phosphorylation of (B) ERK1/2, (C) p38, and (D–F) JNK
  shows MAPK phosphorylation is not changed with insulin stimulation in TS cells.
  B, densitometry of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 was combined into one measurement.
  D–F, phosphorylated JNK bands detected by Western blotting are labeled bands a,
  b, and c. B–F, expression was normalized to ERK2. G–I, reduced activation of Akt
  by insulin in TSKI cells relative to TSWT cells. H and I, densitometry analyses
  are shown with phosphorylation normalized to Akt1. J–N, reduced PDK1 expression
  and phosphorylation at Ser241 in TSKI cells relative to TSWT cells. K–N, densitometry
  analyses are shown. PDK1 expression was normalized to ERK2. PDK1 phosphorylation
  was normalized to ERK2 or PDK1. PTEN inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser380/Thr382/Thr383
  was normalized to PTEN protein levels. O–Q, reduced phosphorylation of GSK3α in
  TSKI cells relative to TSWT cells. P and Q, densitometry analyses are shown. Phosphorylated
  GSK3α was normalized to total GSK3α protein, and phosphorylated GSK3β was normalized
  to total GSK3β protein. A, G, J, and O, Western blot images are representative of
  3 biologically independent experiments. J and O show images from the same biological
  sample set and share the same ERK2 blot used as a loading control. B, C, D, E, F,
  H, I, K, L, M, N, P, and Q, densitometry was used to quantify 3 biologically independent
  experiments. Graphs show the mean ± SD. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; Student’s
