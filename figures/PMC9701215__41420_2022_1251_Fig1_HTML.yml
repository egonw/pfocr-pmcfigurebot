figure_title: Cell death resistance in cancer evolutionâ€”a double-edged sword? During
  early tissue transformation, intercellular variations, e.g., in DNA replication
  and repair, may lead to early transformation through an accumulation of various
  (driver) mutations
caption: These mutations, in turn, may increase clonal fitness by increasing proliferation
  and/or metabolism and hence enable single, advantageous clones to expand and form
  precursor lesions, while disadvantageous clones may be eliminated through various
  modes of cell death. Early neoplasm formation is accompanied by a steady increase
  in selective pressure through increases in oxidative stress and nutrient scarcity,
  which, in turn, fuels selection for even fitter clones carrying resistance to oxidative
  stress, cell death, and/or immune intervention, which may ultimately lead to tumor
  formation. However, when cell death resistance is induced during early tissue transformation,
  expansion of otherwise unfit clones may be enabled. This may ultimately lead to
  the formation of smaller and less invasive tumors through further rounds of selection.
