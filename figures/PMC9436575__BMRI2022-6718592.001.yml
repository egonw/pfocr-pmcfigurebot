caption: '(a) Rats weight (g). (b) Ovarian index (mg/g). (c and d) The estrous cycle
  of rats during D10 to D25: vaginal smears were examined by HE staining in each group
  (×200 magnification; scale bars: 10 μm). (e–g) EA upregulate serum AMH and E2 levels
  and downregulate serum FSH Levels in POI rats. (e) Serum AMH, (f) serum FSH, and
  (G) serum E2. Values were presented as mean ± SD (n = 6; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01,
  compared with the control group; ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01, the EA group versus the
  model group; @p < 0.05 and @@p < 0.01, the GnRHa group versus the model group).
  HE: hematoxylin and eosin; SD: standard deviation.'
