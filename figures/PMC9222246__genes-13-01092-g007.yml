caption: Expression analysis of two iridoids biosynthesis genes. (A) Secologanin and
  catalpol biosynthetic pathway in plants. Genes that were missing in this study and
  genes with <5 TPM values are shown in blue. (Bâ€“D) Heatmap analysis of genes involved
  in two iridoid pathways. (a) Genes cluster showing a high expression in the roots.
  (b) Genes cluster showing a strong expression in the 90 DAP flowers. (c) Genes cluster
  showing a strong expression in the 90 DAP leaves. Genes highlighted in red indicate
  genes assigned to each cluster and the number in parentheses is the total number
  of genes encoding the enzyme expressed in R. glutinosa transcriptome. TPM, transcripts
  per million.
