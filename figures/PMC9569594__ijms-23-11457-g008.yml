caption: 'Metabolomic set enrichment analysis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Notes:
  Metabolomic set enrichment analysis showing the most changed functional metabolism
  of MDA-MB-231 (A) and MCF-7 cell lines (B) after treatment with compound 1 in duration
  of 48 h. Molecular pathways were ranked according to the probability (p-value) of
  finding a particular number of significantly changed metabolites in the compound
  list of a certain pathway.'
