caption: Results of over-representation analysis of the metabolite compounds present
  in Juniperus communis L. and Taxus baccata L. pollen grains. The red color indicates
  a significant level (p < 0.01) while the yellow color indicates a significant level
  at p = 0.10. The circles represent the number of metabolites involved or enriched
  in the pathway. The enrichment ratio refers to the ratio of the number of metabolites
  detected by GCâ€“MS analysis to the total number of metabolites annotated by the pathway.
  The enrichment overview presents the top 25 metabolic pathways.
