caption: 'DSC2 suppressed the metastasis of GC cells through inhibiting β-catenin
  nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. After treating with ICG-001
  (20 μM), the migration and invasion of MGC-803 cells that transfected with sgRNA-DSC2
  and sgRNA-NC were detected by scratch wound-healing assay ((a) 60×), transwell migration
  assay ((b) 200×), and transwell invasion assay ((c) 200×). (d) The expressions of
  MMP9, CD44, and N-cadherin were determined by Western blot assay. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD from three separate experiments. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. sgRNA-NC.
  ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. Low-DSC2 group.'
