caption: VPS13C expression is negatively correlated with GSTP1 expression in cervical
  cancer(A) Gene set enrichment analysis based on KEGG pathways and the LinkedOmics
  database showed that VPS13C-related genes were significantly enriched in drug metabolism
  pathways.(B) Top-ranked genes whose expression was negatively correlated with VPS13C
  expression in the drug metabolism pathway.(C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of
  VPS13C-related genes in SiHa cells treated with cisplatin.(D) GSEA plot of glutathione
  metabolism enrichment in ME180 cells treated with cisplatin.(E) Venn diagram showing
  the overlapping genes identified by RNA-seq analysis of SiHa and ME180 cells and
  obtained from the LinkedOmics database.(F) Correlation analysis of VPS13C and GSTP1
  mRNA expression. Pearson’s correlation coefficients and p values are shown.
