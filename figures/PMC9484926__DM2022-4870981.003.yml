caption: 'Overlapping DEGs of datasets. (a–d) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and enriched
  KEGG signaling pathways were selected to demonstrate the primary biological actions
  of major potential genes. Colors represent the significance of differential enrichment,
  the size of the circles represents the number of genes, the larger the circle, the
  greater the number of genes. In the enrichment result, P < 0.05 or FDR < 0.05 is
  considered to be a meaningful pathway (enrichment score with −log10 (P) of more
  than 1.3). BP: biological process; CC: cellular component; MF: molecular function.'
