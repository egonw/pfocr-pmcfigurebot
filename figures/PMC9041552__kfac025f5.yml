caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of microRNAs (miRNAs). An IPA Core Analysis
  was performed on predicted mRNA targets of miRNAs differentially packaged within
  microvesicles (MVs) after ozone exposure relative to air controls. The mRNA targets
  were limited to those involved in “Inflammatory Response” and “Respiratory Disease”
  pathways. Significantly enriched (p < .05) Canonical Pathways (top) and Diseases
  and Functions (bottom) among predicted mRNA targets of differentially expressed
  miRNAs. Bars, enrichment [−log(p value)].
