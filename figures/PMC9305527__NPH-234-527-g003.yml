caption: Diurnal rhythm of benzylacetone (BA) biosynthesis genes and its expression
  pattern in flower tissues. (a) Rhythmic emission of BA and expression of related
  genes. Relative transcript levels (mean ± SD) of NaPAL4, Na4CL1, NaPKS2, and NaAER1
  peak at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 12, 4 h before the peak of BA emission. NaODO1‐like
  and NaEOBI‐like also peak at ZT 12 when the BA synthesis genes peak, and NaEOBII‐like
  peaks 4 h earlier than other MYP transcription factors. NaEOBI/II‐like, Nicotiana
  attenuata EMISSION OF BENZENOID I/II‐like; NaODO1‐like, N. attenuata ODORANT1‐like.
  (b) Violin plots show the expression levels of BA biosynthetic genes and MYB transcription
  factors across all clusters at three different time points. The levels of Na4CL1
  and NaAER1 transcript peak at ZT 12 (widest sections of violin plots are higher
  than ZT 8 and ZT 16), as shown in (a). NaPAL4 and NaPKS2 transcript levels at ZT
  16 are higher than those at ZT 8 and 12 in clusters 0, 3, and 4. Violin plots of
  MYB transcription factors also reflect transcriptional dynamics shown in (a). (c)
  Kessler & Baldwin () reported the percentage of N. attenuata floral scents in the
  floral headspace. BA is synthesized mainly in the corolla limb, and cis‐α‐bergamotene
  is synthesized in the corolla tube. Quantitative transcript analysis of BA biosynthetic
  genes in dissected flower tissues of limb and tube reveals that the lack of BA emission
  in the corolla tube resulted from the limited expression of NaPKS2 and NaAER1 (mean ± SD;
  n.s., not significant, **, P < 0.01; ****, P < 0.0001; two‐tailed Student’s t‐test).
  NaPAL4, N. attenuata phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase 4; Na4CL1, N. attenuata 4‐coumarate:CoA
  ligase; NaPKS2, N. attenuata polyketide synthase 2; NaAER1, N. attenuata 2‐alkenal
  reductase 1.
