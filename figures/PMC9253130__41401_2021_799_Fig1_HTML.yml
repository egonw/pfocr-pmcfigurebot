caption: a The levels of the CBS and CSE genes are associated with the prognosis of
  patients with different cancers (bladder urothelial carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma
  and skin cutaneous melanoma). Kaplan–Meier curves for recurrence-free survival were
  created using a Kaplan–Meier plotter (www.kmplot.com), in which bladder urothelial
  carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma patients were classified
  according to high and low CBS/CSE gene expression. The hazard ratio (with 95% confidence
  interval) and the log rank P value were calculated. b Animal treatment methods.
  c Representative imaging of footpad model mice and the tumor volume at the footpad
  of each group at the end of the experiment (n = 6). Data are represented as mean ± SD.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. d Representative H&E tissue staining of lungs from footpad
  model mice.
