caption: Visualization and validation of the differentially expressed metabolites
  in ShBNIP3 vs. ShLuc groups in the LV myocardium untargeted metabolomic dataset.
  (A). Venn diagrams show the number of metabolites that were differentially abundant
  in ShLuc vs. Sham (red), ShBNIP3 vs. Sham (green), and ShBNIP3 vs. ShLuc (blue).
  (B,C). Heat maps and PCA plots show the relative log2-fold expression and the variance
  in biological samples, respectively, in Sham, ShLuc, and ShBNIP3 groups of the differentially
  abundant metabolites in ShBNIP3 vs. ShLuc groups. (D). Volcano plot shows the log2-fold
  change in group means for the metabolites whose abundance increased (red) or decreased
  (green) in the ShBNIP3 vs. ShLuc groups, taking a cutoff −Log10 p-value of 1.3 (p
  < 0.05). (E). Heat maps show the most enriched Metabolic Pathways by the −Log10 p-value
  of the untargeted metabolomics dataset. The heat maps were generated in IPA after
  “Core Analyses” of each of the two-group comparisons, which were then compared with
  each other in IPA’s “Comparison Analyses” function. (F). Metabolic pathways that
  were predicted to be enhanced (orange bar) or attenuated (blue bar) in shBNIP3 vs.
  ShLuc, taking a cutoff −Log10 p-value of 1.3 (orange line). (G). Enrichment pathway
  analysis of the metabolites that were differentially downregulated (left) or upregulated
  (right) in ShBNIP3 vs. ShLuc. Data were generated in MetaboAnalyst 5.0 bioinformatics
  software using the “Enrichment Analysis” function. (H,I). Heat maps and PCA plots
  show the relative log2-fold expression and the variance in biological samples, respectively,
  in Sham, ShLuc, and ShBNIP3 groups of the differentially abundant acyl-carnitines
  in ShBNIP3 and ShLuc groups vs. Sham.
