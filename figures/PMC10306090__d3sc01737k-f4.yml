figure_title: (A) Alternations in the metabolic pathways in HeLa cells treated with
  Rh-Mito (1.0 μM, 6 h). These metabolites are analysed by GC-TOF-MS in the positive
  mode. The color of the circles means the p-value, and the area of the circles means
  pathway impact. The impact of Rh-Mito treatment on the cellular levels of base metabolites
  (B), nucleoside metabolites (C), TCA cycle and glutaminolysis-related metabolites
  (D), and one-carbon metabolism-related metabolites (E). The relative content is
  normalized by the peak area of adonitol (internal standard). (F) The impact of Rh-Mito
  (6 h) on the SAM/SAH ratio detected with ELISA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p <
  0.001 by the Student's two-tailed t test
