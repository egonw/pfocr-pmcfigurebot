figure_title: miR-760, as a negative factor, targets HM13 in breast cancer
caption: A The potential candidate miRNAs targeting HM13 were screened and presented
  by the Venn-diagram. B The relative mRNA expression of HM13 was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
  miR-6822-3p mimics (miR-6822-3p), miR-6747-3p mimics (miR-6747-3p), miR-149-5p mimics
  (miR-149-5p) or miR-760 mimics (miR-760) was transfected into breast cancer cell
  lines for 48 h before harvesting, respectively. C The mRNA expression of HM13 in
  SUM1315 (left) and ZR-75-1 (right) cell lines after transfected with miR-760 inhibitor
  (inh-760) and inhibitor control (inh-NC) was determined by qRT-PCR. D Relative protein
  expression of HM13 from four groups containing miR-760 inhibitor (inh-760) group,
  miR-760 mimics (miR-760) group and their corresponding control groups (inh-NC and
  miR-NC) was evaluated through western blot. E Schematic diagram of the regions in
  the 3′-UTR of HM13 mRNA. F Relative luciferase activities of wild type and mutant
  HM13 reporter plasmid in SUM1315 (left) and ZR-75-1 (right) cell lines transfected
  with miR-760 mimics (miR-760) or mimics control (miR-NC). Data were shown as mean ± SD,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
