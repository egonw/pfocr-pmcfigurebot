caption: 'Regulation of sphingolipid metabolism in NAFLD(A) A schematic illustration
  of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism in human hepatocytes. Abbreviations: SPT, serine
  palmitoyl-CoA transferase; CerS, ceramide synthase; and DES, dihydroceramide desaturase;
  SMase, sphingomyelinase pathway S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; CDase, ceramidases;
  SK, sphingosine kinase; S1PPase, sphingosine phosphate phosphatases GCDase, glucosidase;
  GalCDase, galactosidase; C1P, ceramide 1-phosphate. The modeled reactions are labeled
  with ‘R#’.(B) Averaged normalized flux differences across the SL reactions of the
  hepatocytes at different stages of NAFLD. Red and blue color denotes up- and downregulation
  of reaction fluxes within at two different stages of NAFLD. Reaction fluxes at a
  particular NAFLD stage was estimated by using a non-uniform random sampling method
  that finds solutions among the feasible flux distributions of the metabolic network.
  ∗p < 0.05 (two-sample t-test, adjusted for FDR).(C) Log2 fold change (FC) of the
  differentially expressed (p < 0.05 adjusted for FDR) metabolic genes (MGs) of SL
  pathways at two different stages of NAFLD. Expression of multiple genes mapped to
  a particular reaction was determined by GPR rules.'
