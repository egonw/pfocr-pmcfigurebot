caption: 'The experimental periodontitis (EP) rat model was established by ligation.
  (A) The alveolar bone loss of rats in the EP and control groups was imaged by stereomicroscopy,
  and statistical analysis was performed. Scale bars = 1000 μm. (B) Periodontal tissue
  HE staining. Box areas represent bone resorption. Scale bars = 500 μm. (C) Immunohistochemical
  staining of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in periodontal tissues.
  The right figure is an enlarged image of the left selected area. Scale bars: left=
  500 μm; right = 200 μm. (D) The mRNA levels of TRPV1, TNF-α and IL-1β were detected
  by real-time PCR, with GAPDH as a control. (E) Western blotting was used to detect
  the expression levels of TRPV1, PI3K, phospho-PI3K, Akt, phospho-Akt, and IL-1β.
  (F) Analysis of TRPV1 and IL-1β protein expression levels, with GAPDH as a control.
  (G) Analysis of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation levels. The data are expressed as the
  mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. * P<0.05, * * P< 0.01,
  * * * P< 0.001, ns = no significant difference'
