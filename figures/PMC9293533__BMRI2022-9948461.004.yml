caption: FGF12 regulates the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and stemness of CRC
  cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (a) WB was conducted to detect
  the expression of PI3K/AKT target genes (p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT (473 S), p-AKT (T308),
  and AKT) in FGF12-silenced cells. (b) WB was conducted to detect the expression
  levels of PI3K/AKT target genes in FGF12-deficient cells after adding 740 Y-P. (c)
  EdU assays was performed to evaluate the proliferative ability of FGF12-deficient
  cells after adding 740 Y-P. (d) Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the apoptosis
  of FGF12-deficient cells after adding 740 Y-P. (e) Tumorsphere assay of CRC cells
  transfected with sh-FGF12 after adding 740 Y-P. (f) Transwell assays were used to
  evaluate the invasion of CRC cells transfected with sh-FGF12 after adding 740 Y-P.
  (g) WB was performed to detect the expression levels of EMT markers in FGF12-deficient
  cells after adding 740 Y-P. CRC, colorectal cancer; ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01.
