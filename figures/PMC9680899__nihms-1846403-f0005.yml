figure_title: Innate immune activation related to cerebrovascular dysfunction in Huntington’s
  disease (HD)
caption: 'a. UMAP of integrated cerebrovasculature cells in post mortem control and
  HD human patients. b. Cell fraction analysis of astrocyte and microglia subclusters;
  statistics shown for highlighted clusters using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Center-line
  denotes the median; box limits denote the upper and lower quartiles; and whiskers
  denote the 1.5x interquartile range. c. Pathway analysis of the top 10 enriched
  upregulated pathways in HD endothelial, mural, and fibroblasts cells. d. PKR immunostaining
  in perivascular glial processes across various HD grades. PKR is normally detected
  in the vasculature in control samples; arrows indicate PKR-immunopositive vasculature-coupled
  glial processes that become apparent in HD samples only. e. PKR immunostaining co-localizes
  with GFAP and engulfs blood vessels with low CLDN5 expression. f. Western blot quantification
  for tight junction proteins CLDN5 and TJP1. Scale bar, 20μm. WB: two-tailed t test,
  *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001. Error bars denote standard deviation.'
