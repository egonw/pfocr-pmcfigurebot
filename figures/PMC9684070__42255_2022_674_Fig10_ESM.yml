figure_title: Obesity induces ECM genes in adipose tissue ECs
caption: (a-b) Top 5 enriched genes in (a) visceral and (b) subcutaneous AT EC clusters.
  (c-d) Comparison of obesity-induced gene expression changes across EC clusters in
  (c) visceral and (d) subcutaneous AT. Any gene showing a |log(FC)| > 0.1 in any
  cluster was used to collate the list of genes used for these analyses. The numbers
  show the Pearson’s r-value for each comparison. (e) BioPlanet-annotated pathways
  enriched in DEGs in the cap2 versus cap1 population in visceral AT. Data are expressed
  as -log10(p-adj). Genes significantly enriched (p-adj < 0.05) in cap2 versus cap1
  ECs were used for this analysis. (f) Heatmap showing obesity-associated gene expression
  changes in select ECM components. a – arteries + arterioles (art), c – capillaries,
  v – veins + venules (ven). Art, capillary and ven ECs were defined using markers
  outlined in Extended Data Fig. . (g) Heatmap showing gene expression changes in
  the ‘Integrin signaling’ pathway in cap ECs. Cap ECs were defined using markers
  outlined in Extended Data Fig. . (h-i) Quantification of (h) angiogenic and (i)
  proliferating ECs in each of the 7 tissues. Top genes enriched in angiogenic and
  proliferating ECs in the AT are provided in Extended Data Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary
  Tables –. Data were analyzed using a two-sided χ2-test. (j) Obesity-associated changes
  in the expression of genes associated with angiogenesis and proliferation in visceral
  and sc AT capillary ECs. (k-l) BioPlanet-annotated terms significantly enriched
  in genes (k) upregulated and (l) downregulated in LECs in visceral and sc AT. Data
  are expressed as -log10(p-adj). Top 100 (k) up- and (l) downregulated genes, ranked
  by log(FC), were used for these analyses. p-adj indicates adjustments for multiple
  comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, FC – fold change. Differential
  expression from scRNA-seq data is expressed on a natural log (loge) scale.
