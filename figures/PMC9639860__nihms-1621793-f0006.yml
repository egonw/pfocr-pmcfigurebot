  phagocytosis in response to Mtb in vitro infection
caption: IL-17A, IL-2 and TNF-α were evaluated in culture supernatant of PBMCs, previously
  treated with GSI, anti-hDLL1, or anti-hDLL4 for 24 h and infected with Mtb H37Rv
  for 72 h, using the Magnetic Luminex Assay Kit. (A) Experimental design, (B – D)
  Cytokine quantitation of IL-17, Il-2 and TNF-α, respectively. (E) Experimental design
  of phagocytic activity analysis - PBMCs from control subjects were pretreated with
  anti-hDLL1 and anti-hDLL4 for 24 hours and then infected with the Mtb H37Rv strain.
  (F) Phagocytosis analysis of this experiment was performed using the resazurin metabolism
  assay by viable internalized bacteria. The bars represent the mean ± standard deviation
  (n=6). The bars represent the mean ± standard deviation (n=6). The results were
  analyzed through the t-test. ** P <0.005, * P <0.05.
