caption: TNFRSF9 expression affected cell invasion ability and apoptosis. (a, b) The
  invasion ability of MGF-7 cells (a) or ZR-75-30 cells (b) transfected with si-TNFRSF9
  or pcDNA3.1-TNFRSF9 was determined using Transwell invasion assay. Quantitative
  analysis of the invasive cells in Transwell assays was also performed (lower panel).
  (c-d) Apoptosis assays of MGF-7 cells (c) or ZR-75-30 cells (d) transfected with
  si-TNFRSF9 or pcDNA3.1-TNFRSF9, and the quantitative analysis of the apoptosis cells
  (lower panel). ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
