caption: (A) Ethylene generation rates normalized to total biofilm protein in the
  MECs with anodes fixed at −0.15 V and +0.15 V. Normalized (B) intracellular and
  (C) extracellular glutamate and glutamine concentrations. The dotted line represents
  the detection limit of the method. Error bars show the standard deviations for three
  biological replicates. Asterisks represent the statistical difference (t test) between
  treatments (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; N.S., not significant [P > 0.05]).
