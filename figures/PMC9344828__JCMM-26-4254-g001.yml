caption: 'LSD1 inhibition decreased TLR4/NOX4, ferroptosis and oxidative stress that
  were caused by H/R in HK‐2 cells. The HK‐2 cells were subjected to hypoxia 12 h
  and reoxygenation 6 h. The cells were pretreated with TCP or transfected with si‐NC
  or si‐LSD1 for 24 h and then subjected to H/R. (A–C) The expression of TLR/NOX4
  pathway was examined by Western blot, and the quantification was also shown. (D–I)
  The regulatory effect of LSD1 on ASCL4, 4‐HNE, GPX4 and FSP1 expression in HK‐2
  cells after H/R, and quantification. (J) The regulation of LSD1 on SOD activity
  in HK‐2 cells after H/R. (K) The regulation of LSD1 on MDA content in HK‐2 cells
  after H/R. (L) The regulation of LSD1 on GSH level in HK‐2 cells after H/R. (M)
  The regulation of LSD1 on Fe2+ level in HK‐2 cells after H/R (n = 8). The results
  were expressed as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, when compared with the control group. #p < 0.05,
  when compared with the H/R + DMSO group. △p < 0.05, when compared with the H/R + si‐NC
  group'
