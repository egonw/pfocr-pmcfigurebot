caption: DHEA-S to T metabolic pathway analysis by SID-LC-MS/MS. Percentage of total
  of each androgen measured from 5 µmol/L DHEA-S treatment at each timepoint in CWR22PC
  WT cells (A), percentage of total of each androgen measured downstream of DHEA from
  5 µmol/L DHEA-S treatment at each timepoint in CWR22PC WT cells (B), percentage
  of total DHT measured in CWR22PC WT cells from 5 µmol/L DHEA-S treatment (C), percentage
  of total of each androgen measured from 5 µmol/L DHEA-S treatment at each timepoint
  in DuCaP WT cells (D), percentage of total of each androgen measured downstream
  of DHEA from 5 µmol/L DHEA-S treatment at each timepoint in DuCaP WT cells (E).
  P values indicated where ***, P < 0.0001 and **, P < 0.001 as compared with 24 hours
  timepoint for each metabolite. A analyzes DHEA, B analyzes 5-Adiol, C analyzes DHT,
  D analyzes DHEA, and E analyzes 5-Adiol.
