caption: Combing all the identified metabolites from GC-MS and LC-MS. (A) Overview
  of the global metabolic pathway analysis from identified metabolites. The y-axis
  indicating the log10 transformed p-value after enrichment analysis, and the x-axis
  representing the pathway impact value calculated from the pathway topology analysis.
  (B) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis from the GC-MS and LC-MS
  platforms that were used in this study. (C) The top 5 perturbed metabolites from
  the GC-MS platform. (D) The top 5 perturbed metabolites from the LC-MS platform.
