caption: Efferocytosis gene atlas is enriched across single cell myeloid subsets in
  tumor and can potentially develop into inflammasome rich macrophages in the TME.
  (A, B) Single cell dataset from HNSCC patients was analyzed for genes associated
  with efferocytosis pathway in the myeloid subsets (n=6). Bubble heat map showing
  relative expression pattern of several efferocytosis genes across various myeloid
  subsets in the tumor (A) compared to matched blood (B). (C) Feature plot shows inflammasome
  and efferocytosis pathway associated genes across different myeloid subsets within
  the tumor are not transcriptionally enriched in similar clusters. (D) Representative
  violin plot highlighting efferocytosis and inflammasome genes are enriched differentially
  in distinct myeloid subsets within the tumor. (E) Developmental trajectory of monocytes
  and macrophages enriched in the tumor indicate efferocytosis rich C1QC+ and SPP1+
  macrophages can potentially develop into inflammasome gene rich INHBA+ and NLRP3+
  subsets respectively in the TME. Cells are colored according to their cluster origin.
