figure_title: Human lung cancer cell lines produce immunoregulatory glucocorticoids
caption: 'A A simplified scheme of the glucocorticoid (GC) synthesis pathway in humans.
  B Expression of CYP11A1, CYP11B1 and HSD11B1 was assessed in non-small cell lung
  cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines by RT-qPCR. Expression
  levels were normalized to β-ACTIN. Bars indicate mean values + SD (n = 3). C GC
  concentration in cell culture supernatant of control or metyrapone-treated cells
  (MET) was assessed in the GC bioassay. Bars show mean values + SD (n = 3) D Primary
  murine splenocytes were pretreated with buffer control or RU486 (100 nM) for 1 h,
  prior to treatment with 0, 3 or 30 ng/ml cortisol, or lung cancer cell line supernatant.
  After 2 h cells were activated with concanavalin A (1 µg/ml) and CD69 expression
  in CD4 + T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry after 20 h. Mean values + SD of
  n = 3 (cortisol titration) or n = 3–5 (cell culture supernatants) experiments are
  shown. Representative CD69 expression profiles for CD4 + T cells treated with H460
  and H510 cell culture SN: dashed light gray plot = activated CD4 + T cells, black
  plot = treated with cell culture SN, gray plot = treated with cell culture SN plus
  RU486. Statistical analysis was performed by using Two-way ANOVA multiple comparisons
  (C), or two-tailed unpaired t-test (D). ** = p < 0.005; *** = p < 0.0005; **** =
  p < 0.0001; ns not significant, ND not detectable.'
