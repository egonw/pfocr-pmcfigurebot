caption: Synergistic anti-inflammatory effect of extracts from Chrysanthemum zawadskii
  flower and Cudrania tricuspidata fruit. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with each extract
  alone or cotreated with both extracts. The ethanol extracts of CZ were from either
  dried flower (a) or fresh flower (b). Cell viability was determined using the MTT
  assay (top panel). The mRNA levels of iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6 were analyzed using
  RT-PCR (bottom panel). (c) RAW 264.7 cells were treated with each extract alone
  or cotreated with both extracts as indicated. The mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6
  were analyzed using RT-PCR. Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
  ∗P < 0.05 vs. LPS treatment.
