caption: Common pathogenetic events in AAV. Priming of neutrophils by cytokines, such
  as C5a, leads to upregulation of the expression of ANCA target antigen on the cell
  surface. The primed neutrophils are further activated by ANCA, resulting in respiratory
  burst and degranulation, as well as the release of NETs, thus causing damage to
  vascular endothelial cells. Activated neutrophils could further activate the complement
  alternative pathway, resulting in the generation of C5a, which amplifies the inflammatory
  response by priming neutrophils for ANCA-mediated activation. TF-bearing microparticles
  are released by activated neutrophils as well, activating the coagulation system
  and producing thrombin. Thrombin causes activation of platelets, which in turn can
  further amplify the alternative complement pathway. Disturbed B-cell and T-cell
  immune homeostasis is also critically involved in disease development. ANCA, anti-neutrophil
  cytoplasmic antibody; AAV, ANCA-associated vasculitis; C5a, complement 5a; TF, tissue
  factor; NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps; MPO, myeloperoxidase; PR3, particular
  proteinase 3; BAFF, B-cell activating factor.
