figure_title: Bioinformatics analysis of miR-199a-5p
caption: '(A) The intersection diagram of target genes of miR-199a-5p. (B) GO analysis
  of target genes of miR-199a-5p. The vertical axis represents GO function items,
  and the horizontal axis represents the three parts of GO: biological process, cellular
  component, and molecular function. (C) KEGG signaling pathway analysis of target
  genes of miR-199a-5p. The vertical axis represents the KEGG signaling pathway, and
  the horizontal axis represents the Gene Ratio, that is, the ratio of the number
  of genes in a KEGG pathway to the number of all the annotated genes in the KEGG
  pathway. The larger the proportion of genes, the higher the degree of enrichment.'
