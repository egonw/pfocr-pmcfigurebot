caption: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ATP production (200,000 cells/well) among
  Leghorn (A,B) Ghs6 and (C,D) Ghs13 and (E,F) Fayoumi M5.1 inbred genetic lines before
  and after inoculation with 10X Coccivac-B52 (Merck Animal Health, Kenilworth, NJ)
  as determined by the Agilent Real-Time ATP Rate Assay and Seahorse XFe96 analyzer
  (Santa Clara, CA). Data represent mean ATP production rate (pmol/min) attributed
  to glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism (n = 5 birds/treatment) ± SEM. Filled
  and empty bars denote separate ATP contributions from glycolytic and mitochondrial
  metabolism, respectively, while the stacked bar (filed + empty) represents total
  ATP production. Pie charts above each bar denote the relative contribution of each
  pathway as a percentage of total ATP production. Different letter labels on same-colored
  slices within the same timepoint are significantly different, p ≤ 0.05.

  to evaluate systemic immune response variations to Eimeria challenge in three novel
