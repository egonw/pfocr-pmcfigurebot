caption: CSFV infection antagonizes the activation of HSP90AA1 on NF-κB pathway. (A,
  B) Western blot for P65, p-IκBα and IκBα in HSP90AA1-overexpression or knock-downed
  PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. Cells were infected with CSFV (MOI=1) after transfection
  p3×Flag-HSP90AA1 or siHSP90AA1, and the cells were not infected with CSFV as a control.
  Cells were harvested at 24hpi and 48hpi served to Western blot. The relative levels
  of proteins were estimated by histograms representing density reading of the gel
  bands with Image J, and the ratios were calculated relative to tubulin control.
  (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001 calculated using two-way
  ANOVA, ns, not significant).
article_title: HSP90AA1 interacts with CSFV NS5A protein and regulates CSFV replication
  via the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathway.
