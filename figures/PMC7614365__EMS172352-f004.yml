figure_title: Single pathway perturbation delineates the essential signals for Epi-
  and Am-spheroid formation
caption: A, Spatial transcriptome data of the CS6 postimplantation marmoset embryo
  (Bergmann et al., 2021). B, Screening conditions used to probe signalling pathways
  that promote or inhibit Epi- and Am-spheroid fate. C, Squamous spheroid forming
  capacity of microgel cultured primed cmPSCs (N=2, two independent cell lines) at
  day 6 under tested conditions. D-G, Confocal immunofluorescence images of control
  Epi- and Am-spheroids (D), when treated with BMP4 (E), SB43 (F), or ActA (G). Cells
  were stained for SOX2 (EmDisc) and TFAP2C (amnion). Fluorescence intensity (shown
  on the right) was quantified on Hoechst masks for each frame in the z-stack.
