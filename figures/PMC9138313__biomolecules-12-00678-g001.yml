caption: Schematic representation of the synthesis of H2S and ethylene and its association
  with the S-assimilation pathway. In plants, absorption of S occurs through uptake
  of SO42− from the soil by roots. The assimilatory pathway is activated to produce
  APS from SO42− under catalysis by ATP-S, which is in turn reduced to SO32− via APR.
  Afterward, SO32− is reduced to S2−, which is used to produce H2S via catalysis by
  chloroplast-localized sulfite reductase. The subsequent catalyzation of S2− by OASTL
  yields Cys, which is the first stable compound in the S-assimilation pathway and
  the precursor for GSH and Met. Met is converted to SAM by SAM synthetase, from which
  ACC is synthesized by ACS, degradation of which by the ACO enzyme yields ethylene.
  Ethylene-induced H2S in turn regulates ethylene biosynthesis via the persulfidation
  of ACO. H2S can also be generated through degradation of Cys or through biosynthesis
  in mitochondria and cytosol by the enzymes CS, CAS, LCD, and DCD. Activity of LCD
  and DCD in the cytosol is accompanied by formation of pyruvate and NH3. ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
