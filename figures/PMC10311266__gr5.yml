caption: TRAF7 promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1. A TRAF7 facilitates
  the proteasomal degradation of TBK1. HEK 293 ​cells (2 ​× ​105) were transfected
  with TBK1 and TRAF7 (dose), and the cells were incubated in the presence or absence
  of MG132 (5 ​μmol/L) for 10 ​h. B TRAF7 promotes the ubiquitination of TBK1. HEK
  293 ​cells (2 ​× ​105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids and cells were
  treated with MG132 (5 ​μmol/L); after 12 ​h, the cells were infected or uninfected
  with SeV (MOI ​= ​1) for 10 ​h before Co-IP and immunoblotting analysis. C and D
