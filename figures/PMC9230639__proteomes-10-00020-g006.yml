caption: Enrichment of GO biological processes in significantly downregulated proteins.
  Panther pathway analysis of GO biological processes enriched in the downregulated
  proteins identified 13 processes all associated with protein biosynthesis. The GO
  biological process was plotted against the fold enrichment and the significance
  is shown for each as a False Discovery Rate (FDR) value.
