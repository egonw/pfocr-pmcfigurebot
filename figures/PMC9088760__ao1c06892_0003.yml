caption: 'Effects of different concentrations of GOQDs on the viability, proliferation,
  and morphology of BMSCs. (A) Live/Dead staining image shows the cell viability of
  BMSCs cocultured with GOQDs at different concentrations for 3 days. Green indicates
  live cells and red indicates dead cells. (B) Number of living cells counted by means
  of ImageJ software, (C) EdU cell proliferation assay image showing the cell proliferation
  of BMSCs cocultured with GOQDs at different concentrations for 1 day, (D) ratio
  of EdU-positive cell, and (E) confocal laser images used to capture the cell morphology
  of BMSCs cocultured with different concentrations of GOQDs for 1 day after BMSCs
  were stained with phalloidin and DAPI. Red indicates actin filaments and blue indicates
  cell nuclei. (F) Number of cell nuclei was counted by means of ImageJ software.
  Scale bars: 200 μm (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, compared with 0.1 μg/mL
  GOQDs, and #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001, compared with control).'

  the Proliferation and Differentiation Ability of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells
  through the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.
