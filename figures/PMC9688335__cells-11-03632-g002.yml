caption: 'Characteristics of CRPC xenografts. (A) Growth trajectories of PDXs in the
  first 600 days after engraftment. Each step marks a mouse-to-mouse transplantation.
  Time from tumor engraftment to first mouse-to-mouse transplantation is indicated
  by an arrow. (B) Histological architecture of PDXs (top panel) and original patient
  tumors (bottom panel), examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Scale bars equal
  100 µm. (C) CNA profiles of CRPC PDXs (PC2400, PC2412, PC2416, PC2416-DEC and PC2459),
  HSPC PDXs (PC82, PC295 and PC310) and a normal prostate tissue control from an unmatched
  source, across a subset of genes and genomic regions recurrently altered in CRPC.
  Grouping per biological pathway. Amplifications (blue), homozygous deletions (red),
  partial losses (yellow) and unaltered regions (grey) are indicated based on ASCAT
  analysis of SNP array data (n = 1 for each PDX). ASCAT analysis failed for PC2412
  PDX due to sample complexity. All PC2412 CNA calls were determined manually except
  for the region 10q with complex rearrangements (white). CNA frequency bar plots
  are provided for each PDX (top panel) and each genomic region (right panel). Additional
  alterations present in PC2416-DEC PDX, as compared to PC2416 PDX are marked with
  a white asterisk. (D) t-SNE plot of pathway activity in CRPC PDXs (PC2400 (n = 5),
  PC2412 (n = 5), PC2416 (n = 5), PC2416-DEC (n = 5) and PC2459 (n = 3); red) and
  HSPC PDXs (PC82 (n = 2), PC295 (n = 2), PC310 (n = 7); blue), based on GSVA scores
  for 50 MSigDB cancer hallmark gene sets, using RNA sequencing data. (E) Nuclear
  ERG staining in PC2459 PDX. Scale bar indicates 100 µm. (F) Copy number profile
  of chromosome 21 in PC2459 PDX, displaying the ERG and TMPRSS2 genes on 21q22.2-3.
  BAF: B allele frequency; LRR: log R ratio; CN: total copy number.'
