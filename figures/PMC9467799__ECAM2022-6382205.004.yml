caption: 'SSD against inflammation and pathological damage of upper genital tract
  by inhibiting SIRT1/NLRP3 signaling. 33 rats were used for these experiments: sham
  group (n = 8), SPID group (n = 6), SSD group (n = 6), SIRT1 inhibitor (EX527) group
  (n = 6), and SSD + EX527 group (n = 7). After the SPID model was established, the
  rats in the EX527 group were intragastrically administered with a 5 mg/kg/day SIRT1
  inhibitor (Sigma, Munich, Germany; No. E7034). The rats in SSD + EX527 group were
  intragastrically administered with 5 mg/kg/day and 6.64 g/kg • day SSD. The rats
  in the sham group and SPID group were given the same amount of normal saline. The
  content of TNF-α (a) IL-1β (b) IL-6 (c) and IL-18 (d) in serum samples of rats in
  each group was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). (e) The numbers
  of WBCs and lymphocytes were counted under a microscope. (f) H&E stain was used
  to observe the pathological changes in the fallopian tube and uterine tissues. The
  magnification is 200× and 400×. Yellow arrow: vasodilation and hyperemia; blue arrow:
  lymphocyte; black arrow: endometrial lamina propria edema; H&E: hematoxylin and
  eosin; WBCs: white blood cells; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IL: interleukin; SPID:
