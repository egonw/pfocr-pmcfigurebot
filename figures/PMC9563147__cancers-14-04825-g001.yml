caption: Workflow of the driver activation state inference, pathway analysis, subtyping
  and survival analysis, and driver-HPV status association analysis for HNSCC patients.
  (a). Integration of multi-omics data types to infer driver activation state inference
  using TCI method and EM method. Mutations and CNV data are combined into SGA data
  and expression data are transformed to DEG data, which are used as the input of
  the TCI model. TCI calculates casual relationships between SGAs and DEGs for each
  individual patient, and we further generalize the most statistically significant
  causal SGA → DEG interactions in TCGA HNSCC patient cohort. Based on TCI inferred
  SGA → DEG causal relationship and selected DEG expression profile, EM algorithm
  is used to infer protein activation states for each HNSCC patient. (b). HNSCC patients
  can be divided into four subtypes based on 64 driver activation state and their
  survival outcome are significantly different among these patient subtypes. Our analysis
  also shows the viral driver proteins can be triggered by HPV status and regulate
  its downstream gene expression.
