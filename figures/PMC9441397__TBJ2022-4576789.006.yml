caption: 'RBM8A silencing represses the viability, DDP resistance, and metastasis
  of breast cancer (BC) cells via inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway. (a) The protein
  expression of phosphorylation (p)-mTOR and p-AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells was detected
  by western blot. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sh-NC, ##P < 0.01 vs. sh1-RBM8A; (b and c) the viability
  and DDP resistance of MDA-MB-231 cells were detected by MTT assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs.
  sh-NC, ##P < 0.01 vs. sh1-RBM8A; (d) the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was detected
  by wound-healing assay. (e and f) the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells
  were detected by transwell assay. ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. sh-NC, ##P < 0.01 vs. sh1-RBM8A.
  Each experiment was repeated three times.'
