caption: The ASFV I10L protein inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65. (A) The
  ASFV pI10L reduces the distribution of p65 in the nucleus. The PK-15 cell lines
  stably expressing the ASFV pI10L or harboring the empty vector were treated with
  TNF-α (20 ng/mL) for 10 or 20 minutes. The cells were next concentrated and lysed,
  followed by subcellular fractionation assay and immunoblotting analysis. (B) The
  ASFV pI10L inhibits the TNF-α-triggered nuclear translocation of p65. The PK-15
  cell lines stably expressing the ASFV pI10L or harboring the empty vector were treated
  with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) or PBS for 5 minutes and then subjected to confocal microscopy.
  The PCC was used to indicate the overlapping coefficient between p65 (red) and nuclei
  (blue). A total of 50 cells were randomly selected to evaluate the nuclear localization
  ratio of p65, and the statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism.
  (C) Deletion of the I10L gene greatly compromises the ability of ASFV to block the
  activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The primary porcine alveolar macrophages
  were left uninfected or infected with ASFVWT or ASFVΔI10L (MOI = 3) for 24 hours,
  after which the cells were treated or untreated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) for 20 minutes,
  subcellular fractionation assay, and immunoblotting analysis were performed.
