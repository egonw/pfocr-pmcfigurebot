caption: Human HCCs display sex differences in HDAC3 levels. (A) staining intensity
  of HDAC3 in HCC. Scale bar, 100 μm. (B-C) Staining intensity of Foxa1 and Foxa2
  in HCC. Scale bar, 100 μm. (D) The chi-square test revealed HDAC3 expression was
  presumably lower in female HCC. (E-F) Correlation analysis revealed that Foxa1 (r = 0.5265;
  p < 0.0001) and Foxa2 (r = 0.5550; p < 0.0001) were positively associated with HDAC3
  expression in female HCC patients. (G) Diagram of the hypothetical roles of HDAC3
  in female HCC development by regulating the Foxa1/2 signalling pathway. * p ＜ 0.05
  and **** p ＜ 0.0001
article_title: Hepatocyte-specific HDAC3 ablation promotes hepatocellular carcinoma
  in females by suppressing Foxa1/2.
