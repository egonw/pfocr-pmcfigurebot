caption: IBV Nsp14 degraded chJAK1 via the autophagy pathway. (A–C) HD11 cells were
  co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg), pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (2 μg) or pCMV-Myc-chJAK1
  (1 μg), pCMV-Myc-chJAK2 (1 μg), and pCMV-Myc-chSTAT1 (1 μg). After 24 h, protein
  expression was measured using Western blotting. (D) HD11 cells were transfected
  with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg), pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (2 μg), or pcDNA3.1-Flag-EV
  (1 μg). After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 6 h.
  Protein expression was measured using Western blotting. (E) HD11 cells were transfected
  with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg) or pcDNA3.1-Flag-EV (1 μg). After 24 h, the cells
  were stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) and then treated with dimethyl sulfoxide
  (DMSO), 3-MA (0.5 mg/mL), MG-132 (20 μM), leupeptin (400 μg/mL), and NH4Cl (20 mM)
  for 6 h. Protein expression was measured using Western blotting. (F) HD11 cells
  were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14 (1 μg) and pCMV-chJAK1 (1 μg). After
  24 h, the cells were incubated with DMSO, 3-MA (0.5 mg/mL), MG-132 (20 μM), leupeptin
  (400 μg/mL), and NH4Cl (20 mM) for 6 h. Protein expression was detected using Western
  blotting. (G,H) HD11 or DF-1 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-Nsp14
  (2 μg), pchGAS-luc (200 ng), and pRL-TK (10 ng). Meanwhile, the cells were treated
  with 3-MA. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with chIFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 6
  h. Then, luminescence was detected using dual-luciferase reporter assays. Protein
  expression was detected using Western blotting. Data were presented as means ± SD.
  ns = not significant.
