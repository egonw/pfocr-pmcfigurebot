caption: 'CD6 expression on T cells afer hematopoietic cell transplantation. (A) Percentage
  of CD6-positive cells and (B) CD6 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) on regulatory
  CD4 T cells (Treg, red boxes), conventional CD4 T cells (Tcon, blue boxes) and CD8
  T cells (CD8, green boxes) in healthy donors (HD) and in patients at 1, 2, 3 and
  6 months after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Box plots indicate median,
  Q1 and Q3 and min and max. (C) Representative gating strategy used to define T-cell
  subsets, based on the expression of CD45RA, CCR7 and CD95 markers. (D) Heat map
  summarizes the median CD6 MFI values in the different T-cell subsets in HD and in
  patients at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after HCT. White stars show statistically significant
  differences between HD and samples after transplant (any P<0.05). (E) CD6 MFI on
  Treg, Tcon and CD8 T cells based on the expression of PD-1 in HD and in patients
  at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after HCT. Statistically significant differences are noted:
  ****P<0.0001; ***P< 0.001; **P<0.01; *P<0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test.'
