caption: Deficiency of HECA in cardiomyocytes promotes activation of the PDGF‐BB/PDGFRB/AKT
  pathway. (A) Representative pictures (left) and quantification (right) of PDGFRB
  expression in the pGreen and HECA‐shRNA groups were detected by western blot. (B)
  The relative protein expression of p‐PDGFRB, p‐AKT, and p‐STAT3 was detected by
  western blot after treatment with 0 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, and 100 ng/ml PDGF‐BB for 10 min.
  (C) The relative protein expression of p‐PDGFRB, p‐AKT, and p‐STAT3 was detected
  by western blot at 0, 5, and 10 min of treatment with 100 ng/ml PDGF‐BB.
