caption: 'Top predicted Alzheimer’s disease-relevant genes in multiple brain regions,
  with whole blood as reference tissue(a) Pearson correlation coefficient of top 20
  predicted genes from the Alzheimer’s disease pathway (KEGG), ranked by average correlation.
  (b, c, d) Average per-gene expression (x-axis) versus prediction performance (Pearson
  correlation between predicted and ground truth expression) in (b) cerebellum, (c)
  cortex, and (d) hippocampus. HYFA exhibits strong prediction performance for several
  Alzheimer’s disease-relevant genes including APOE (cortex ρ=0.536, cerebellum: ρ=0.502),
  APP (cortex ρ=0.524), PSEN1 (cerebellum: ρ=0.459), and PSEN2 (cortex: ρ=0.590, cerebellum:
  ρ=0.559, hippocampus: ρ=0.403). In cerebellum, PSEN1 (ρ=0.459), PSEN2 (ρ=0.559),
  and APOE (ρ=0.502) attained above expected performances (average ρ=0.448). APP (ρ=0.524),
  PSEN2 (ρ=0.590), and APOE (ρ=0.536) surpassed the expected correlation in cortex
  (average ρ=0.443).'
