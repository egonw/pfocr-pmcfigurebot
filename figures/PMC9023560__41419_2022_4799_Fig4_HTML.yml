figure_title: The HGF/c-Met pathway promotes PNI in pancreatic cancer by activating
  mTOR/NGF axis
caption: A, B Western blot analysis of the expression of p-Met, c-Met, p-mTOR, and
  mTOR in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells treated with different concentrations of HGF.
  C, D Cancer cell-DRG coculture model for the control and MHY-1485 groups in PANC-1
  cells and BxPC-3. E, F Western blot analysis of NGF expression in PANC-1 cells and
  BxPC-3 cells treated with different MHY-1485 concentrations. G, H Western blot analysis
  of the expression of p-mTOR, mTOR, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and Vimentin in PANC-1
  cells and BxPC-3 cells treated with different MHY-1485 concentrations. I, J Wound
  healing assay of the control and MHY-1485 groups in PANC-1 cells and BxPC-3 cells.
  K, L Transwell-based assay of the control and MHY-1485 groups in PANC-1 cells and
  BxPC-3 cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
