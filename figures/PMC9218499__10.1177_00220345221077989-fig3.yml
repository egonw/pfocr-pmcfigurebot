caption: SC-RNA-seq in human gingiva shows the expression of the taste receptor signaling
  pathway. An overall 87,240 cells from human gingival tissue were divided into 4
  main populations as endothelial, epithelial, fibroblast, and immune cells and 30
  subsets (). Expression values are normalized and scaled averages by Python 3.9.
  The color of each square represents the mean expression level of each gene in a
  corresponding cell subset. Notably, the Fib1.5 subset shows a high expression level
  of the SCC markers PLCÎ²2 and DCLK1, the bitter taste receptors TAS2R4 and TAS2R14,
  Toll-like receptors (TLR2-5), MMPs, complement activation C3, and immune cell marker
  PTPRC (i.e., CD45), which makes this subset the potential chemoreceptor cell type
  in the human gingiva.
