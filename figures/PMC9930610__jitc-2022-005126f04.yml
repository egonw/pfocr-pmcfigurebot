caption: GLIS1-/- mice attenuated HCC growth and enhanced the anti-tumor activity
  of CD8+ T cells. (A) Schematic diagram of drug administration in mice. (B) Picture
  display of the respective group (GLIS1+/+, GLIS1+/- and GLIS1-/- mice) of subcutaneous
  tumors. (C) The volume and (D) weight statistics of subcutaneous tumors in the respective
  group (GLIS1+/+, GLIS1+/- and GLIS1-/- mice). (E) The tumors were confirmed by HE
  staining. Immunohistochemical results of Ki67 and TUNEL expression in the respective
  group. (F) Immunohistochemical results of CD8 expression in the respective group.
  (G) Immunofluorescence results of PD1 expression in the respective group. (H) TSNE
  plot showing distributions of 36 cell clusters. (I) The TSNE diagram showing the
  distribution of cell clusters in the respective sample. (J) A total of 36 cell clusters
  were divided, and we defined the respective group of the mass cytometry results.
  (K) The histogram showing the number of the respective cell cluster in different
  groups by mass cytometry. **p<0.01,***p<0.001. NS indicates no significant difference.
  HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.
