caption: GSDMD deficiency alleviates formation of oxalate crystals in GSDMD−/− mice.
  (A) Oxalate crystals formation was observed through Von Kossa staining in kidney
  of WT mice and GSDMD−/− mice treated with Gly. (B) Serum creatinine levels were
  detected in WT mice and GSDMD−/− mice treated with Gly (n=6). (C) Immunohistochemical
  examination of indicated proteins in NLRP3-GSDMD pathway in Gly-treated WT mice
  and GSDMD−/− mice. Scale bars, 50 µm. (D) The contents of the same proteins were
  analyzed by western blot analysis. GSDMD, gasdermin D; WT, wild-type; Gly, glyoxylic
  acid; NLRP3, leucine-rich repeat-containing family pyrin domain-containing 3; OPN,
  osteopontin.
