caption: Schematic diagram displaying the prototypical transduction pathway upon the
  activation of adenosine A1 receptors by adenosine. Activation of this receptor inhibits
  adenylyl cyclase activity and decreases cAMP levels. Downstream signaling pathways
  involving cAMP signaling include PKA, which plays a role in reducing neuronal ATP
  release (red) from efferent nerve terminals and the purinergic component of nerve-mediated
  contractions. Activation of adenosine A1 receptors had no effect on neuronal acetylcholine
  (ACh) release (green) and the cholinergic component of nerve-mediated contractions
  in the mouse detrusor.
