caption: Proteins with tryptophan variants were largely clustered in cytoplasmic glycolysis
  pathway. (a) Functionally grouped KEGG pathways of the modified-tryptophan-containing
  proteins with terms as nodes linked based on their kappa score level (â‰¥0.4), where
  the label of the most significant term per group is shown in color and bold. The
  node size represents the term enrichment significance. Functionally related groups
  show partial overlap. (b) Heatmap depicting the relative expression levels of the
  identified modifications in CC groups.
