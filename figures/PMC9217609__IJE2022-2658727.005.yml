caption: (a) Western blotting was used to detect phosphorylated AMPK, phosphorylated
  mTOR, phosphorylated ULK1, ATG5, and LC3BII/I in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells treated with
  TET3 knockdown or AMPK knockdown. CCK-8 assay (b) and colony formation assay (c)
  showed that AMPK knockdown partially attenuated the inhibited proliferation induced
  by TET3 knockdown in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells.
