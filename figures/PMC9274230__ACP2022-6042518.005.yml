caption: After intragastric administration of sunitinib to mice with EMs, the number
  of ectopic focus reduced and the expression of p-VEGFR, YBX1, and snail was inhibited.
  (a) The number of ectopic focus in the small intestine of mice. t = 11.16, ∗∗∗∗P
  < 0.0001. (b) Immunochemistry was performed to detect the positive rate of p-VEGFR,
  YBX1, and snail in the control group and sunitinib group (200x, 400x).
