caption: Schematic representation of polyamine biosynthesis. The most important biosynthetic
  pathway begins with the action of arginase on arginine, forming ornithine, and its
  subsequent decarboxylation provides putrescine (PUT). PUT may also be obtained from
  arginine via decarboxylation to agmatine and subsequent action of agmatinase (left
  column). In addition, ornithine may be obtained from arginine and glycine via arginine-glycine-amidinotransferase.
  Glutamate and proline provide additional sources (middle columns). The additional
  carbon chains of spermidine and spermine are derived from methionine (right column).
