caption: (A) Capsaicin inhibited the colony formation and sphere formation of WB‐F344
  cells in a dose‐dependent manner. Colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
  stained with 0.1% crystal violet 7 days later. Spheres were observed and captured
  6 days later. (B) The expression of OCT4, SOX2, c‐Myc, NANOG, and SIRT1 was detected
  with western blot in liver tissues from the DEN and DEN+capsaicin groups. (C) Immunofluorescence
  staining showed that SIRT1 and SOX2 were expressed in human hepatocarcinomaat a
  higher level than in corresponding adjacent tissues. Scale bars, 40 μm. (D) Immunohistochemical
  staining showed that the expression of SIRT1 and SOX2 was lower in the DEN+capsaicin
  group than in the DEN group. Scale bars, 40 μm
