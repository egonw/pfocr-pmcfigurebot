caption: A schematic graph illustrating the role of miR-146b-5p in LPS-stimulated
  hDPCs. LPS binds to TLR4 thus activating the NF-κB signaling pathway and resulting
  in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, MCP1, IL1α, IL1β, and TNFα.
  Generally, IL6 further initiates JAK/STAT3 signaling, which is responsible to generate
  mature miR-146b-5p. miR-146b-5p, in turn, negatively regulates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway by targeting TRAF6, IRAK1, and RELA. The same phenomena were confirmed in
  LPS-applied rat dental pulp tissues ex vivo. Created with BioRender.com.
