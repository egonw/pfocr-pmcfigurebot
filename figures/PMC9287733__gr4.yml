caption: 'Model III: Ultrasensitivity arising from coupled NRF2 and sMaf positive
  autoregulation and heterodimerization. (A) Structure of Model III, containing basal
  synthesis of NRF2 (k10) and sMaf (k40), NRF2-sMaf dimer-induced synthesis of NRF2
  (k1 and Kd1) and sMaf (k4 and Kd4), stressor S-inhibited degradation of NRF2 (k2
  and Kd2) and S-independent degradation of NRF2 (k3), degradation of sMaf (k5), association
  (k7) and dissociation (k8) between NRF2 and sMaf, and degradation of NRF2-sMaf dimer
  (k6). (B) Simulated steady-state dose-response of NRF2, sMaf, and NRF2-sMaf as indicated,
  exhibiting strong ultrasensitivity. (C) The degree of ultrasensitivity of NRF2-sMaf
  is altered when the NRF2 and sMaf autoregulatory loops are both present, only one
  is present, and both are absent.'
