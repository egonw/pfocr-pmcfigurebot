caption: '(A) Distribution of AR scores in study groups (cumulative score of AR pathway
  activation, calculated based on mRNA expression of 10 transcriptional targets of
  AR). Light blue points express any of the AR-V splice variants (V1, V3, V7, V9);
  dark blue points do not express AR-V splice variants. “Positive” area represents
  AR score in “activated” range compared to reference group (CTRL: benign non-hyperplastic
  prostate tissue). “Negative” area represents depression in AR signaling. (B) mRNA
  expression of proliferation marker MKI67. (C) Analysis of AR score distribution
  in four “tumor” study groups in relation to dependence on AR-V splice variant expression.
  (D) Analysis of MKI67 mRNA expression in ADT and CRPC groups in relation to dependence
  on AR-V splice variant expression. (E) Analysis of UBE2C mRNA expression in ADT
  and CRPC groups in relation to dependence on AR-V splice variant expression. p-levels
  calculated using Mann–Whitney U-test. Statistical significance (p < 0.05): * vs.
  PRIM group, # vs. CTRL group, § vs. PRIM MTS group.'
