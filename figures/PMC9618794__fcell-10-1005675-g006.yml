caption: N-acetyl aspartate biosynthesis in prostate LN-Flu cells. (A) Box and whisker
  plot of metabolites involved in the pathway. (B) Levels Prostate specific membrane
  antigen (PSMA) determined by Western blot. Densitometric analysis of the western
  blot bands from three independent experiments is shown on the right. Results are
  the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. ***p < 0.005 significant difference
  between LNCaP and LN-Flu cells by two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparisons
  test. (C) N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) biosynthesis showing the metabolites and enzymes
  we have found up (red arrow up) or down (red arrow down) in LNFlu cells compared
  to LNCaP cells.
