caption: The influence of ruthenium complexes 1–4 on FGF-2 secreted by the ovarian
  cancer cells treated in vitro for 24-, 48-, or 72-h; U represents the untreated
  control, and the starred columns indicate a significant increase in FGF-2 production
  in measured up to untreated control cells. Starred columns represent the significant
  changes versus the untreated control.
