caption: 'NMDA receptor activation may act through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  to promote the senescence of BM-MSCs. (A) Purchased primary mouse BM-MSCs were divided
  into three groups: PBS, NMDA-treated, and NMDA + MK-801 groups, which received corresponding
  treatments. NMDA treatment significantly promoted the phosphorylation of β-catenin
  and inhibited the activity of β-catenin, which were partially rescued by MK-801
  (n=3); (B) NMDA treatment inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, while
  MK-801 partially improved it (n=3); (C) the expression of cyclin D1 and C-myc proteins
  decreased in the NMDA treatment group, which could be partially improved by MK-801
  (n=3). **P<0.01 vs. PBS; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 vs. NMDA. PBS, phosphate buffer solution;
  NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; MK-801, dizocilpine; TOP Flash/FOP Flash, commercial
  firefly luciferase reporter gene; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  BM-MSCs, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.'
