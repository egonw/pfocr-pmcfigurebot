caption: 'A: Lollipop plot displaying mutation distribution and protein domains for
  NR5A2 gene in cancer with the labeled recurrent hotspots. Somatic mutation rate
  and transcript names are indicated by plot title and subtitle. B: Oncoplot displaying
  the somatic landscape of lung cancer cohort. C: Cohort summary plot displaying distribution
  of variants according to variant classification, type, and SNP class. Bottom part
  (from left to right) indicates mutation load for each sample, variant classification
  type. A stacked barplot shows top ten mutated genes. SNP, single nucleotide polymorphisms.'
article_title: NR5A2 gene affects the overall survival of LUAD patients by regulating
  the activity of CSCs through SNP pathway by OCLR algorithm and immune score.
