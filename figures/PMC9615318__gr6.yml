caption: (a) Boron Nitride hollow nanospheres (BNS) initiate apoptosis and necrosis
  by the Caspase-3/7 pathway (Shown above in  (a)) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
  release, respectively. (b) Biodegradable boron nitride nanoparticles lead to cancer
  cell death. The use of the thermal neutron approach leads to DNA, mitochondria,
  and cell organelle damage. (c)Iron-based nanoparticles cause tumor cell death by
  converting H2O2 to OH. Free radicals in Fenton chemical process. The release of
  excessive free radicals leads to DNA and mitochondrial damage. {Concept generated
  from Refs. [,]}.
