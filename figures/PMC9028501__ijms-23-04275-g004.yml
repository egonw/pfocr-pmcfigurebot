caption: 'Theoretical SARS-CoV-2 hypothalamic infection pathway: SARS-CoV-2 could
  utilize the olfactory epithelium for host entry []. Anosmia is a common symptom
  in COVID-19, and axonal transport through the olfactory nerve has been proposed
  as the mechanism. Nonetheless, most olfactory sensory neurons do not express the
  required proteins, and lack the projections needed to reach targets in the brain
  []. The olfactory epithelium, however, expresses entry proteins necessary for SARS-CoV-2
  []. Alternatively, the nervus terminalis (NT) may potentially provide a direct route
  to critical brain targets such as the hypothalamus. NT afferent fibers innervate
  the Bowman’s glands and express both ACE2 and cathepsins B and L []—the viral entry
  proteins for SARS-CoV-2. NT fibers terminate in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus
  [], potentially providing SARS-CoV-2 with access to the hypothalamic neuronal network.
  Specifically, within the POA, a group of neurons referred to as the “kisspeptin
  neuronal network” (KNDy) might be affected. The KNDy neurons are mainly expressed
  in POA and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) [], where they play a vital role in pituitary
  hormone secretion, thermoregulation, and autonomic response, and provide neuronal
  projections to critical limbic brain regions [,,,]. Figure was created with the
  BioRender software.'
